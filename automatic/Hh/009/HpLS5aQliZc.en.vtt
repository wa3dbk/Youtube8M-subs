00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.580

 not finished pulls bag will roll the ball 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.410
 disseminate the great musicians who 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.350
 sertaneja music is also a great 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.350
 barn in samba and pagoda 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.959
 oh souza 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.200
 So we thought we'd do something. 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.360
 pioneer in the state that is to bring together all 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.550
 segments of samba is a samba 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.510

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.700
 romantic and unite it take our 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.080
 artists his songs for others 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.760
 because when we are 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.760
 Having a party in Cuiabá 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.769
 now rio de janeiro and savior then 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.720
 We want to take some of the culture 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.489
 of the samba that in the state for others 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 places and show that also field 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:31.599
 big in this backland this idea 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:34.200
 The main thing is to look at your 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.200
 my future 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.940
 it's totally different and it's show 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.010
 any of the pagoda's there 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.980
 they managed to bring the same root samba 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.550
 with the new people you have in the market 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.650
 and it manages to gather handsome people there 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.000
 cold beer finishes drink 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.580
 if we can find our friends 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.920
 all because it is different than the sertanejo 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.080
 command in the city, then a 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.410
 differential of a well-organized samba is 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.280
 Well cool and they managed to do that. 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.280
 The level 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.400
 for this initiative is fundamental until 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.310
 because we are not in the state what is the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.650
 predominance of the sertanejo and this project 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.170
 mention was made of the wheel design of 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.660

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.470
