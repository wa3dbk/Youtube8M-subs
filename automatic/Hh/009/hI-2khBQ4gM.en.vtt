00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that this image is tagged with the srgb

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.370 
color profile srgb short for standard
RGB<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.140> simplified<00:00:28.140> RGB<00:00:28.859> color<00:00:29.099> space<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
RGB is a simplified RGB color space that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.209 
RGB is a simplified RGB color space that
was<00:00:31.380> created<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.669> mid<00:00:32.820> 90s<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
was created in the mid 90s or so and

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.619 
was created in the mid 90s or so and
standard<00:00:35.219> RGB<00:00:35.930> basically<00:00:36.930> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:38.629> leaves

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
standard RGB basically kind of leaves

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
standard RGB basically kind of leaves
things<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> lowest<00:00:40.770> common<00:00:40.980> denominator

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
things to the lowest common denominator

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
things to the lowest common denominator
as<00:00:41.850> far<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> monitor<00:00:43.440> displays<00:00:43.890> color

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
as far as a how a monitor displays color

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.740 
as far as a how a monitor displays color
so<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.940> color<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.360> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.840> muted<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
so that the color is kind of muted and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
so that the color is kind of muted and
the<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.460> assign<00:00:50.460> profiles<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> Photoshop

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the way we assign profiles in Photoshop

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
the way we assign profiles in Photoshop
is<00:00:52.309> done<00:00:53.309> through<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.230> Edit<00:00:55.850> assigned

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
is done through the Edit assigned

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.400 
is done through the Edit assigned
profile<00:00:57.890> now<00:00:58.890> you'll<00:00:59.039> notice<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.640> we

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
profile now you'll notice here that we

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.789 
profile now you'll notice here that we
are<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.789> srgb<00:01:02.789> right<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.439> you'll<00:01:04.439> notice<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
are in srgb right now you'll notice that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
are in srgb right now you'll notice that
we<00:01:05.040> have<00:01:05.240> various<00:01:06.240> options<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.900> far<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.080> what

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
we have various options as far as what

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
we have various options as far as what
RGB<00:01:07.799> color<00:01:08.040> space<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> preferred

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
RGB color space to use the preferred

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
RGB color space to use the preferred
color<00:01:11.100> space<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.090> use<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
color space that I like to use is the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.090 
color space that I like to use is the
Adobe<00:01:13.229> RGB<00:01:13.549> color<00:01:14.549> gamut<00:01:14.760> you'll<00:01:15.150> notice<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
Adobe RGB color gamut you'll notice that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
Adobe RGB color gamut you'll notice that
when<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.189> switch<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.820> forth<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
when we switch back and forth what it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.050 
when we switch back and forth what it
does<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> colors<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.220> colors<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.700> much

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
does to the colors the colors are much

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
does to the colors the colors are much
more<00:01:21.299> vibrant<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.680> Adobe<00:01:23.520> RGB<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
more vibrant because of the Adobe RGB is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.480 
more vibrant because of the Adobe RGB is
a<00:01:24.180> larger<00:01:25.080> color<00:01:25.409> gamut<00:01:25.500> than<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.509> standard

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
spot number one the RGB values here keep

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
spot number one the RGB values here keep
in<00:01:53.549> mind<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.180> take<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.750> these<00:01:54.840> numbers

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
in mind to take a look at these numbers

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
in mind to take a look at these numbers
as<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.770> toggle<00:01:56.420> back<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.450> forth<00:01:57.659> from<00:01:58.549> srgb<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
as we toggle back and forth from srgb to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.660 
as we toggle back and forth from srgb to
you<00:01:59.850> Adobe<00:02:00.360> RGB<00:02:00.659> you'll<00:02:01.560> notice<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you Adobe RGB you'll notice that the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
you Adobe RGB you'll notice that the
numbers<00:02:03.060> stay<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> same<00:02:04.310> now<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
numbers stay the same now we have the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.350 
numbers stay the same now we have the
same<00:02:06.000> numbers<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.600> different<00:02:07.229> color<00:02:07.469> spaces

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
same numbers but different color spaces

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.869 
same numbers but different color spaces
therefore<00:02:09.360> you'll<00:02:09.690> notice<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.879> also

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
therefore you'll notice that also

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.370 
therefore you'll notice that also
reflecting<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.080> small

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380

reflecting the small
RDM<00:02:13.890> with<00:02:14.100> srgb<00:02:14.900> again<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.620> important

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
RDM with srgb again this is important

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.340 
RDM with srgb again this is important
because<00:02:17.280> doesn't<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> big<00:02:18.390> effect<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:19.260> how

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
because doesn't have a big effect on how

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.570 
because doesn't have a big effect on how

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
this image converts to CMYK so depending

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.850 
this image converts to CMYK so depending
on<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> image<00:02:23.880> you'll<00:02:24.270> notice<00:02:24.540> here<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
on the image you'll notice here that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.700 
on the image you'll notice here that
with<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.600> Adobe<00:02:27.600> RGB<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.170> color<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.470> much

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
with the Adobe RGB the color is much

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.690 
with the Adobe RGB the color is much
