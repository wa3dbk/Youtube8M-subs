 moment we present a super good 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 recipe as usual and yes it does not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.859
 knows how to make it happen to us 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 beautiful recipes delay such creative fashion 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.290
 some of you are calling in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.000
 intimacy patches while his wife 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 rather the close call touches today 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.559
 patrick we are going to cook with this call 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 no multi that's what you're going 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.940
 we make a fine pie with salmon 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.260
 with a ratatouille and a little butter 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 with absinthe 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 just before I start I would like 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.489
 say a word about this dangerous product from 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 nick I love pole not multi do 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 can not make from tomatoes 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.780
 fresh 100% Italian tomatoes from 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.729
 red tomatoes soaked in sunshine 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 well yes I love this product of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.229
 tomatoes obviously and that was a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.509
 condition to enter here in this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.290
 cooks tomatoes grown in full 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.540
 cleared field then rid of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.549
 all their yellow green parts it's 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 for that we have a shoulder not good 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.890
 red this is an ideal product for 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810
 to cook everyday in our anthem 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 ladies 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 yes, we have a puff pastry 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.390
 so here we work with a paste 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 quiet puff here she was 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 done in advance so here we go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.020
 use a mill fat so we 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 refined a little bit our paw but we 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 go with a fork 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.939
 we did it before detailing our 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 puff pastry discs and if you 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.770
 did after that would warp our paw 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.439
 okay so have turned on the oven in 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.469
 your animators 180 degrees and we will 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.909
 take in our cookie cutter and we 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.610
 will carve so 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.569
 our two little tarts and arranged 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.569
 on our site legs 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.280
 here is to put a second one by 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.760
 second from above I do not want at all 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.500
 she raises 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.870
 yeah but finally the guard and its cost 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.900
 6 yeah yeah yes the green flip is 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.010
 really been so we were not 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.750
 obliged to apply if we add 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.730
 some islands on it is still 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.730
 she had as much strength as it rattles 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.129
 so we will prepare our vegetables for 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.739
 art to tatoo so there in the 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.180
 recipe we use a red pepper 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.340
 then we will use red pepper 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.579
 so we will then cut 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.500
 so we will try to find 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.599
 the size of the dice so that 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 that the cooking is very regular and 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.900
 that the form is also pretty voice 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.760
 there and we will do the same for them 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.620
 zucchini for zucchini i will 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.150
 take that glass of zucchini and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.950
 for the inn he answers all the shepherd 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.769
 so all that we'll put it in cooking 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 yeah so a hot pan a 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.849
 olive heard olive oil our 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.319
 a small dash of olive oil is this 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.310
 that you allow me a little mission 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.290
 of course objective is to confirm or 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.639
 to keep a little bit so we'll keep them 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.870
 a little con when we look a little 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.530
 wrong at camp to give texture 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.880
 on the theme is quite 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.549
 we knew very briefly we made leather and 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.160
 relatively fast or do not forget 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.230
 to individually season a small 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.870
 little bit of salt from the island of 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.359
 re quite big ladies gentlemen 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.750
 mulemo salt in the true moments a 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.790
 little bit to pick up the chef's mix 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.280
 so yes we let listen but we 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.430
 taste its tranquil west of the body 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.800
 fat in the kitchen that lasted pretty much 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.290
 a minute at home I you 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.620
 attention is show to the one to the two 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.210
 to three times my own they have what 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.110
 whether it's more than 8 for 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.910
 get rid of it so that she can 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.360
 cool a little bit hard I'm ridding 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.300
 yes on a reef in a container that is 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.950
 when I'm going to improvise was always going 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.260
 a little bit of seasoning our 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.720
 milk vegetables that are thrown out it's really 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.330
 very fast that it's cooked 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.760
 ah yes okay did not listen and after 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.500
 I put them together we go now 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.530
 finish this little ratatouille the pole 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.360
 what we do not see too much to put no 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.650
 no longer we're going to put a little 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 little thyme 1 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.770
 so that's it we'll get rid 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.960
 now in a container 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.450
 so we will prepare the elements for 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.800
 our white butter with absinthe you go 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.690
 to make a white butter yes a little 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.140
 white butter shallots white vinegar 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.940
 then white can age and 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.080
 sherry vinegar that's what I 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.360
 wanted besides so is there one to 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.800
 absinthe but we will put in the end ok 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.500
 so we'll reduce it 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.610
 here is now fire is an art the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.940
