collaborating to me means sharing the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.880 
collaborating to me means sharing the
same<00:00:18.130> passion

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.060 

just<00:00:21.810> being<00:00:22.810> ourselves

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.700 

having<00:00:25.850> fun<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.480> dancing<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:27.170> all<00:00:27.350> sharing

the same passion and I just think that's

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.679 
the same passion and I just think that's
why<00:00:30.699> collaborate<00:00:31.699> so<00:00:32.029> different<00:00:32.419> from<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.660> lot

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689
