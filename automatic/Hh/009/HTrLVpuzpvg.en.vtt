00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.559
 I am sergio but I have an installation 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 which is composed of some elements 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.509
 tires are like small 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.700
 pneumatic architectures that inhabit 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 inside the museum space that in this 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.460
 case 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.650
 originally it was thought that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750
 stay 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.539
 comments on his side inside the interior 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.789
 but it 's a space so big that what 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.200
 I'm relating to a corridor 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.220
 and a wall is not then 2.2 tubes 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.220
 meters in diameter 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.989
 that run parallel horizontally 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.340
 or at ground level horizontally 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.100
 as vertically 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.570
 on a higher level or even 3 we are 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.020
 trying to have like three levels 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.910
 different traffic in which the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.880
 public will be able to access the level 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.830
 inferior and we are going to do 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.560
 different recordings in different 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.810
 heights 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.670
 of the pneumatic elements are 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.110
 transparent and translucent so 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.870
 that allow you to see 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.510
 the people that are let 's say to the other side 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.270
 of the membranes is like a division 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.010
 of space by some elements almost 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.890
 immaterial what are the membranes of 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.250
 plastic in relation to the volume that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 occupy 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 well I will make at least one pair 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.470
 of space occupation experiments 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.550
 and placement in which I put a little 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.160
 in question both the relationship that has 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.150
 with the architectural context and also 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.150
 as 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.960
 the idea of ​​the materiality of the object 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 artistic as a sculpture I or I am 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 I consider as part of a generation 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 that we are the ones who started to work 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 a little late perhaps 90 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.880
 mid or late 90 in which 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.030
 we started to understand how we started 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.740
 question the element as performative 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.740
 which implies almost any 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 action related to an object 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.209
 artistic 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 me in my case for example from a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.459
 trajectory that has to do with the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.489
 tradition of sculpture we started to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.079
 understand how about the importance of 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.849
 Performativity when creating 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.190
 meaning and meaning is to say the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.909
 contextualization of the object in a in a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.159
 environment 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.290
 regardless of, say, a 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.659
 disciplinary question is whether it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.629
 try to make a performance that will be 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.370
 a little for me the error that there was in the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.890
 approach in the 70s that maybe that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.569
 it seemed that one's own 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.689
 discipline was a solution 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.439
 to a problem of how it is integrated into 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.790
 society in art and in the case in 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.349
 our case more from a tradition 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.030
 sculptural we ask ourselves what 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.030
 influence had like the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.430
 performative nature of the action in the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.570
 sense of work I believe that the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.920
 exposition 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.440
 for my approach has more a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.250
 disciplinary character understands for 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.320
 start 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.060
 the discipline of installation for me 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.340
 it does not exist or it is not because it does not have a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.900
 tradition really is a bit the same 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.650
 that what the performance does not think 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.019
 the performance appears the performance 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.689
 it would differ from the theater precisely 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.930
 in what happens in the same space as the 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.250
 spectator is not to say representation 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.829
 happens in the same place I think the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.329
 historical performance artists of 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.129
 the 70s when they realize that 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.109
 really that does not exist that really what 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.420
 that you are creating another form of space 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.650
 of representation within the space 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.860
 let's say common is to say 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.629
 that everything is governed by the rules of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.310
 representation in some way 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.200
 they give up because they realize that the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.200
 political project that they had not 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.650
 It was not very viable I do not know I worked 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.300
 with vito acconci for example four years 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.460
 and I know a little 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.140
 the feeling that they had and the 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.090
 reasons why he leaves the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.060
 sculpture and is dedicated to doing later 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.590
 facilities then it goes to art 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.960
 public and finally to architecture 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.590
 because somehow according to the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.970
 approach that he had then he went as 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.310
 expectations were not met 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.650
 that had political significance what 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 they were doing because of some 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.400
 way precisely what what what 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.840
 generates the gesture of minimal art is 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.510
 precisely the dissolution of 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.810
 disciplines somehow not 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.490
 I think at a level like sensitive and 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.860
 traditionally some artists we 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.430
 we continue to feel like 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.110
 related as with a certain 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.890
 genealogy but it really turns out very 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.420
 difficult to execute it within a few 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.320
 parameters like discipline them 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.390
 materials or whatever specific 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.130
 in the work I have done I have 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.350
 made many videos I've never 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.510
 considered video artist photographs no 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.520
 I consider myself a photographer 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.870
 and I do not consider myself amusing either 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.120
 installation or performers 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.600
 I have used all these means because 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:29.550
 somehow they are the ones that exist 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.590
 let's say in the conventions of what is 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.660
 the art today to achieve others 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 objectives do not maybe make sculptures 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.740
 that they were not today are no longer 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.660
 materially achievable and you have to 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.680
 use other material means to 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.680
 can make them
