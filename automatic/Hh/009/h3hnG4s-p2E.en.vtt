installed<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.640> server<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:31.750> now<00:00:31.930> time

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
installed the server and it's now time

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.560 
installed the server and it's now time
to<00:00:32.230> take<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.739> look<00:00:32.950> at<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.370> very<00:00:33.730> basic

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
to take a look at the very basic

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.770 
to take a look at the very basic
settings<00:00:35.020> that<00:00:35.770> you<00:00:35.800> need<00:00:36.129> in<00:00:36.370> order<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.780> get

settings that you need in order to get

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.689 
settings that you need in order to get
your<00:00:37.809> server<00:00:38.530> ready<00:00:38.860> for<00:00:39.340> its<00:00:39.550> first<00:00:39.940> launch

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
your server ready for its first launch

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.049 
your server ready for its first launch
this<00:00:42.699> is<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.940> quite<00:00:43.269> simple<00:00:43.840> process<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
this is a quite simple process so it

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.650 
this is a quite simple process so it
will<00:00:46.360> be<00:00:46.390> kind<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.320> short<00:00:47.830> video<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.480> let's

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
will be kind of a short video so let's

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.229 
will be kind of a short video so let's
get<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.840> it<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.920> first<00:00:51.220> thing<00:00:51.549> you<00:00:51.729> need<00:00:51.909> to<00:00:51.970> do

you<00:01:30.370> know<00:01:30.580> all<00:01:30.850> about<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.690> startup<00:01:32.140> line<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
you know all about the startup line and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.520 
you know all about the startup line and
what<00:01:32.980> it<00:01:33.100> does<00:01:33.340> if<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.910> don't<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:35.140> just<00:01:35.380> a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
what it does if you don't it's just a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.650 
what it does if you don't it's just a
bunch<00:01:35.800> of<00:01:35.950> commands<00:01:36.910> you<00:01:37.120> tell<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
bunch of commands you tell the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.890 
bunch of commands you tell the
application<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:39.460> start<00:01:39.730> with<00:01:39.910> once<00:01:40.540> you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
application to to start with once you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.070 
application to to start with once you
launch<00:01:41.170> your<00:01:41.470> server<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:43.480> only<00:01:43.690> difference

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
launch your server the only difference

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.890 
launch your server the only difference
between<00:01:44.580> source<00:01:45.580> and<00:01:45.850> global<00:01:46.210> offensive<00:01:46.690> is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
between source and global offensive is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.100 
between source and global offensive is
that<00:01:46.930> go<00:01:47.440> have<00:01:47.770> four<00:01:48.370> gay<00:01:48.850> modes<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.330> each

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
that go have four gay modes and each

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.399 
that go have four gay modes and each
game<00:01:50.620> mode<00:01:50.860> have<00:01:51.580> its<00:01:51.760> own<00:01:51.970> startup<00:01:52.480> line<00:01:52.659> so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
game mode have its own startup line so

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.320 
game mode have its own startup line so
if<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.680> check<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.100> video<00:01:54.490> description<00:01:54.670> you

if you check the video description you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.910 
if you check the video description you
will<00:01:55.570> find<00:01:56.400> one<00:01:57.400> startup<00:01:57.850> line<00:01:58.290> very<00:01:59.290> basic

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
will find one startup line very basic

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.170 
will find one startup line very basic
very<00:01:59.950> stable<00:02:00.490> for<00:02:01.030> each<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:03.010> four<00:02:03.490> game

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
very stable for each of the four game

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.110 
very stable for each of the four game
modes<00:02:04.510> I'm<00:02:04.840> going<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.040> run<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.430> classic

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
modes I'm going to run a classic

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.059 
modes I'm going to run a classic
competitive<00:02:07.840> server<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.560> I'm<00:02:08.739> going<00:02:08.979> to

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
competitive server so I'm going to

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.920 
competitive server so I'm going to
select<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.959> startup<00:02:10.959> line<00:02:11.610> copy<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:12.970> add

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
select that startup line copy it and add

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.199 
select that startup line copy it and add
it<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.370> target<00:02:16.209> box<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:18.549> as<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.970> see

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
it to the target box so as you can see

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.920 
it to the target box so as you can see
we<00:02:19.510> tell<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.019> application<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.950> run<00:02:21.930> kem

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
we tell the application to run kem

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.080 
we tell the application to run kem
strike<00:02:23.200> global<00:02:23.349> offensive<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:24.010> console<00:02:24.849> mode

we<00:02:25.900> will<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.319> using<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.980> map<00:02:27.190> group<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:28.270> bomb

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
we will be using the map group of bomb

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.660 
we will be using the map group of bomb
maps<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.740> will<00:02:29.920> start<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.459> de<00:02:31.300> dust

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
maps and we will start on de dust

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.699 
maps and we will start on de dust
