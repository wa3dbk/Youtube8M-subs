00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
okay this is my burger for my my metal

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.590 
okay this is my burger for my my metal
foundry<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:13.309> got<00:00:14.630> all<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.929> information<00:00:16.199> online

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
foundry I got all the information online

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.560 
foundry I got all the information online
to<00:00:18.600> build<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.970> burner<00:00:21.560> for<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> metal<00:00:22.890> foundry

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
to build this burner for a metal foundry

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
to build this burner for a metal foundry
it's<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.750> made<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> black<00:00:25.320> iron<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.480> then

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's all made out of black iron and then

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.659 
it's all made out of black iron and then
it<00:00:27.689> goes<00:00:27.900> into<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.349> copper<00:00:28.740> fittings<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
it goes into some copper fittings and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:41.030 
it goes into some copper fittings and
it's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.620> regular<00:00:34.620> hose<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:37.790> 20<00:00:38.790> PS<00:00:39.120> no<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:40.040> zero

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
it's a regular hose and 20 PS no a zero

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.150 
it's a regular hose and 20 PS no a zero
to<00:00:41.160> 60<00:00:41.730> pound<00:00:42.559> zero<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> 60<00:00:44.160> psi<00:00:46.160> regulator

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
to 60 pound zero to 60 psi regulator

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.880 
to 60 pound zero to 60 psi regulator
which<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.440> they<00:00:49.440> generally<00:00:49.620> don't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
which is kind of they generally don't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
which is kind of they generally don't
have<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> mini<00:00:50.489> regular<00:00:50.910> story<00:00:51.210> after

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
have the mini regular story after

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.170 
have the mini regular story after
special<00:00:51.899> order<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:53.430> regular<00:00:53.699> propane

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
special order them and a regular propane

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
special order them and a regular propane
tank<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.670> all<00:00:56.670> fired<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> second

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:56.959 

Oh

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.359 

and<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.119> was<00:01:58.299> only<00:01:58.990> about<00:01:59.409> 2<00:01:59.710> 10<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.159> way

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
and that was only about 2 10 to the way

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.209 
and that was only about 2 10 to the way
open<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.259> flame<00:02:02.590> will<00:02:02.859> shoot<00:02:03.070> out

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
open so that flame will shoot out

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.940 
open so that flame will shoot out
probably<00:02:03.579> another<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:06.810> don't<00:02:07.810> know<00:02:07.899> I'm<00:02:08.619> scared

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
probably another I don't know I'm scared

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.880 
probably another I don't know I'm scared
to<00:02:09.129> go<00:02:09.250> too<00:02:09.310> far<00:02:10.140> I've<00:02:11.140> only<00:02:11.260> opened<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.860> up

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
to go too far I've only opened it up

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.140 
to go too far I've only opened it up
about<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.760> quarter<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:15.150> it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
about a quarter of the way and it's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.210 
about a quarter of the way and it's
quite<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> bit<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.349> fire<00:02:18.720> I'll<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.959> to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
quite a bit to fire I'll have to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.119 
quite a bit to fire I'll have to
basically<00:02:21.220> restrict<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:23.260> tip<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> little<00:02:23.769> bit

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
basically restrict this tip a little bit

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.130 
basically restrict this tip a little bit
or<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.580> fly<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.450> need<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.690> flare<00:02:25.930> this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
or now to fly this I need to flare this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.190 
or now to fly this I need to flare this
tip<00:02:26.349> out<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.010> bit<00:02:27.930> probably<00:02:28.930> about

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
tip out just a little bit probably about

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.930 
tip out just a little bit probably about
a<00:02:29.260> total<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.860> quarter<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> an<00:02:30.400> inch<00:02:30.519> or<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
a total of a quarter of an inch or so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.240 
a total of a quarter of an inch or so
and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:31.780> we'll<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.530> ready<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.829> be<00:02:33.010> installed

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and then we'll be ready to be installed

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.600 
and then we'll be ready to be installed
in<00:02:33.579> my<00:02:33.630> metal<00:02:34.630> foundry<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:36.099> burner<00:02:36.340> will

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
in my metal foundry and this burner will

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.030 
in my metal foundry and this burner will
get<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:36.940> temperatures<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:38.380> enough<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.860> melt

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
get up to temperatures on enough to melt

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.860 
get up to temperatures on enough to melt
brass<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.920> aluminum<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:43.410> possibly<00:02:45.870> cast

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
brass and aluminum and possibly cast

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.080 
brass and aluminum and possibly cast
iron<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.590> i'll<00:02:47.680> have<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.950> check<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.519> may<00:02:48.910> not

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
iron but i'll have to check and may not

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.500 
iron but i'll have to check and may not
do<00:02:49.239> cast<00:02:49.510> iron<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.610> anything<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.209> before

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
do cast iron but anything just before

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
do cast iron but anything just before
cast<00:02:52.750> iron<00:02:53.079> i<00:02:53.200> should<00:02:53.379> have<00:02:53.500> no<00:02:53.739> problem

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
cast iron i should have no problem

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.720
