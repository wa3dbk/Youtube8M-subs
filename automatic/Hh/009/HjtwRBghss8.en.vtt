beautiful<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.500> only<00:02:24.680> thing<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.920> kind<00:02:25.100> of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
beautiful the only thing that kind of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.830 
beautiful the only thing that kind of
confuses<00:02:25.580> me<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.870> green<00:02:27.170> pipes<00:02:28.840> I'm

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
confuses me is the green pipes I'm

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.470 
confuses me is the green pipes I'm
thinking<00:02:30.590> Mario<00:02:30.950> why<00:02:31.790> did<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.330> green

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
thinking Mario why did we do the green

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.080 
thinking Mario why did we do the green
pipes<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.069> know<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.819> little<00:02:34.970> bit

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
pipes like I know I can see a little bit

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.460 
pipes like I know I can see a little bit
of<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.420> marble<00:02:35.780> zone<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.170> everything

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
of like the marble zone and everything

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.270 
of like the marble zone and everything
but<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.620> always<00:02:36.709> thought<00:02:36.890> those<00:02:37.040> were<00:02:37.160> like

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
but I always thought those were like

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.270 
but I always thought those were like
grey<00:02:37.550> pillars<00:02:38.090> or<00:02:38.239> yellow<00:02:39.140> or<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.800> guess<00:02:40.100> that

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
grey pillars or yellow or I guess that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.460 
grey pillars or yellow or I guess that
shows<00:02:40.370> my<00:02:40.550> sonic<00:02:40.910> fandom<00:02:41.420> isn't<00:02:42.110> all<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.200> big

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
shows my sonic fandom isn't all that big

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.199 
shows my sonic fandom isn't all that big
because<00:02:42.739> i'm<00:02:42.860> not<00:02:43.010> sure<00:02:43.250> i<00:02:43.520> really<00:02:44.060> love<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
because i'm not sure i really love that

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.990 
because i'm not sure i really love that
