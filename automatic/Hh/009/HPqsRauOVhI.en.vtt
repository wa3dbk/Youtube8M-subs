00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:09.320
 we all want to save on expenses 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.150
 heating of our house 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.599
 especially if we use fuel 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.760
 diesel the LPG 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.560
 the simplest thing to do is to 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.630
 install a pellet boiler that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.210
 heat radiator regeneration a 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.210
 floor and producing sanitary water 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.570
 we start by evaluating what it is 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.910
 possible to recover the old 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.540
 plumbing and then start to 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.980
 dismantle everything that needs to be replaced 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.860
 since an accumulation will have to be installed 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.630
 water called puffer we have to create 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.260
 the space needed to stay 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.260
 this new element 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.550
 when space is finally free yes 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.050
 begins to wire up everything 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.230
 will serve to make the new ones work 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.350
 new circulatory sound components 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.880
 collectors valid names new expansion 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.880
 electrical system and so on 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.930
 now it all begins to take shape 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.620
 boiler the puffer is positioned for 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.540
 a good part has wired the new ones 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.850
 Circulators can't wait to pump 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 hot water in radiators to warm up 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.090
 the House 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.360
 the new electrical system is completed 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.010
 the electronic part test begins 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.490
 insert the temperature probes le 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.140
 offers and activate the thermostat as 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 expected but boilers come on with 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.770
 success and electronics responds to 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.930
 commands all you have to do 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.910
 from here on out it will just load each 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.320
 much and leather tank to clean the 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.850
 ash tray 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.580
 everything else is completely 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.410
 automatic and let it save and the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.410
 home and hot shower pleasure
