the<00:02:53.760> desired<00:02:53.790> length<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.890> works<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.340> same

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
the desired length this works the same

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.570 
the desired length this works the same
way<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.730> any<00:02:57.150> other<00:02:57.480> bead<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:59.370> only

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
way with any other bead the only

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.030 
way with any other bead the only
difference<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:01.020> need<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.350> add<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> stitch

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
difference is you need to add a stitch

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820 
difference is you need to add a stitch
in<00:03:02.370> between<00:03:02.870> larger<00:03:03.870> beads<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.410> I'll<00:03:04.650> show

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
in between larger beads and I'll show

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.710 
in between larger beads and I'll show
you<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.130> next<00:03:07.700> okay<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:08.760> here<00:03:09.240> I'm<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.630> to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
you that next okay so here I'm going to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.560 
you that next okay so here I'm going to
work<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:10.110> some<00:03:10.830> bigger<00:03:11.070> beads<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.330> order

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
work with some bigger beads and in order

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.090 
work with some bigger beads and in order
for<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.840> bigger<00:03:13.020> beads<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> work<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.800> need<00:03:13.920> to

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
for the bigger beads to work you need to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.120 
for the bigger beads to work you need to
create<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> stitch<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.060> between<00:03:15.620> each<00:03:16.620> bead

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
create a stitch in between each bead

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.610 
create a stitch in between each bead
stitch<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.780> need<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.050> give<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.350> space

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
stitch so that you need to give it space

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.820 
stitch so that you need to give it space
so<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.160> doesn't<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:25.200> bracelet<00:03:25.650> doesn't

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
so that it doesn't the bracelet doesn't

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.380 
so that it doesn't the bracelet doesn't
curl<00:03:26.750> um<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.430> let's<00:03:29.700> see<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.210> get<00:03:30.360> a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
curl um so let's see if I can get a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.260 
curl um so let's see if I can get a
focus<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.990> so<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.980> had<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.400> last<00:03:32.640> bead<00:03:33.000> here

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
focus here so I had this last bead here

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.110 
focus here so I had this last bead here
I'm<00:03:33.810> going<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.050> bring<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> one<00:03:34.620> down<00:03:34.970> wrap<00:03:35.970> it

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
I've beaded all the beats I wanted um

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.920 
I've beaded all the beats I wanted um
but<00:03:59.850> I'm<00:03:59.940> gonna<00:04:00.060> start<00:04:01.040> stitching<00:04:02.600> just<00:04:03.600> doing

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
but I'm gonna start stitching just doing

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.970 
but I'm gonna start stitching just doing
regular<00:04:05.030> chain<00:04:06.320> you<00:04:07.320> see<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.739> better

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
regular chain you see this better

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.720 
regular chain you see this better
wrapping<00:04:08.790> around<00:04:08.970> pulling<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.720> through

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.080 

and<00:04:15.730> I'm<00:04:15.879> gonna<00:04:15.970> make<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.239> loop<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.940> need

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
and I'm gonna make a loop and you need

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.689 
and I'm gonna make a loop and you need
to<00:04:19.150> pick<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.359> button<00:04:19.630> fur<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.199> your<00:04:20.380> clasp<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
to pick a button fur to your clasp and

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.159 
to pick a button fur to your clasp and
you<00:04:21.820> wanna<00:04:21.970> make<00:04:22.090> sure<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.660> loop<00:04:22.870> you're

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
you wanna make sure that the loop you're

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.480 
you wanna make sure that the loop you're
making<00:04:23.620> fits<00:04:23.889> around<00:04:24.040> your<00:04:24.250> button<00:04:26.040> do<00:04:27.040> one

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
making fits around your button do one

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:36.210 
making fits around your button do one
more<00:04:27.729> stitch<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:33.130> then<00:04:33.430> I'm<00:04:33.550> gonna<00:04:33.699> grab<00:04:35.220> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
more stitch and then I'm gonna grab the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.860 
more stitch and then I'm gonna grab the
string<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:37.030> I'm<00:04:37.180> gonna<00:04:37.330> do<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.630> stitch

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
string like I'm gonna do is stitch

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.969 
string like I'm gonna do is stitch
except<00:04:38.229> I'm<00:04:38.320> gonna<00:04:38.470> pull<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.740> all<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.919> way

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
except I'm gonna pull it all the way

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.430 
except I'm gonna pull it all the way
through<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.460> create<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.970> uh<00:04:40.000> knot<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.870> so

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
through to create that uh knot and so

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.270 
through to create that uh knot and so
now<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.650> have<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:43.780> chain<00:04:44.110> at<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.380> end<00:04:44.800> and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
now you have the chain at the end and

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.879 
now you have the chain at the end and
you're<00:04:45.850> just<00:04:46.060> gonna<00:04:46.240> loop<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.050> around<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.680> tie

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
you're just gonna loop it around and tie

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.180 
you're just gonna loop it around and tie
a<00:04:47.919> knot<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.060> create<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.450> hoop<00:04:50.190> I'm

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
a knot so that you create a hoop I'm

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.980 
a knot so that you create a hoop I'm
just<00:04:51.460> gonna<00:04:51.639> make<00:04:51.940> before<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.389> tie<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
just gonna make before I tie that in a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.510 
just gonna make before I tie that in a
double<00:04:53.320> knot<00:04:53.350> I'm<00:04:53.620> gonna<00:04:53.740> make<00:04:53.950> sure<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.190> can

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
double knot I'm gonna make sure I can

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.210 
double knot I'm gonna make sure I can
slip<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:55.000> button<00:04:55.419> right<00:04:55.660> through<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:57.100> it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
slip that button right through and it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:07.370 
slip that button right through and it
fits<00:04:57.490> through<00:04:57.669> just<00:04:58.000> fine

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.600 

okay<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:08.530> there's<00:05:08.920> that<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.340> then<00:05:09.460> you'll

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
okay so there's that and then you'll

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.840 
okay so there's that and then you'll
just<00:05:09.640> clip<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.740> excess<00:05:11.740> string<00:05:12.070> on<00:05:12.730> the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
just clip that excess string on the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.900 
just clip that excess string on the
other<00:05:13.000> end<00:05:13.300> you<00:05:13.890> have<00:05:14.890> that<00:05:15.100> that<00:05:15.520> string

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
other end you have that that string

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.210 
other end you have that that string
ready<00:05:19.110> you're<00:05:20.110> gonna<00:05:20.260> push<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.040> through<00:05:21.280> and

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
ready you're gonna push it through and

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.560 
ready you're gonna push it through and
again<00:05:25.110> you're<00:05:26.110> creating<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.740> knot<00:05:27.480> and<00:05:28.480> then

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
again you're creating a knot and then

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.950 
again you're creating a knot and then
you<00:05:28.750> can<00:05:28.930> tie<00:05:29.170> that<00:05:29.910> cut<00:05:30.910> that<00:05:31.060> string<00:05:31.600> my
