all<00:01:49.420> directions<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.799> key<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.450> what's<00:01:52.450> that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
all directions the key is is what's that

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.999 
all directions the key is is what's that
weight<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.170> your<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.619> speak<00:01:53.859> your

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
weight is in your so to speak your

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.160 
weight is in your so to speak your
arches<00:01:54.429> it<00:01:54.789> must<00:01:55.060> basically<00:01:55.539> be<00:01:55.719> in<00:01:55.990> your

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
arches it must basically be in your

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.870 
arches it must basically be in your
arches<00:01:56.499> the<00:01:56.649> whole<00:01:56.799> swing<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.579> what<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.789> I

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
arches the whole swing and what do I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.179 
arches the whole swing and what do I
mean<00:01:57.999> by<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.359> well<00:01:58.959> if<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.590> I'm<00:01:59.859> gonna<00:01:59.950> pull

want to help us have a better wider
knees<00:02:09.039> outward<00:02:09.399> pressure<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> rotate

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
knees outward pressure when I rotate

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.140 
knees outward pressure when I rotate
back<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.000> think<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.720> knees

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
back in I like to think that the knees

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.640 
back in I like to think that the knees
they<00:02:16.150> rotate<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.780> little<00:02:16.959> bit<00:02:17.080> both<00:02:17.440> knees

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
they rotate in a little bit both knees

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.170 
they rotate in a little bit both knees
go<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.040> together<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.640> can<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:18.880> they<00:02:19.000> both

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
go in together as you can see they both

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.580 
go in together as you can see they both
turn<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.569> not<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> case<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:19.959> one<00:02:20.170> doing<00:02:20.470> this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
turn it's not a case of one doing this

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.289 
turn it's not a case of one doing this
way<00:02:20.769> and<00:02:20.980> doing<00:02:21.129> that<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.519> they're<00:02:22.060> going<00:02:22.239> to

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
way and doing that way they're going to

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.520 
way and doing that way they're going to
stay<00:02:22.480> relatively<00:02:22.870> level<00:02:23.260> because<00:02:23.409> they're

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
stay relatively level because they're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
stay relatively level because they're
going<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> both<00:02:23.890> turn<00:02:24.099> into<00:02:24.129> level<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:24.939> this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
going to both turn into level this this

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.780 
going to both turn into level this this
this<00:02:26.319> club<00:02:26.950> as<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.159> can<00:02:27.310> see<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.579> we're

this club as you can see is we're

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.039 
this club as you can see is we're
working<00:02:27.939> together<00:02:28.060> both<00:02:28.360> ways<00:02:28.629> you<00:02:28.870> don't

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
working together both ways you don't

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.270 
working together both ways you don't
ever<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.409> it<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.709> against<00:02:30.010> each<00:02:30.099> other

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
ever see it going against each other

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.479 
ever see it going against each other
like<00:02:30.849> like<00:02:32.040> Pistons<00:02:33.040> okay

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
like like Pistons okay

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
so what we want is to wait should

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.170 
so what we want is to wait should
whatever<00:02:35.769> wait<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.159> do<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.549> sort<00:02:36.909> of<00:02:37.000> speak

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
whatever wait we do have sort of speak

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.240 
whatever wait we do have sort of speak
turning<00:02:37.659> and<00:02:37.810> shifting<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.560> rotating

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
turning and shifting it's rotating

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.030 
turning and shifting it's rotating
around<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.909> ad<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.569> ankles<00:02:41.049> alright<00:02:41.920> because

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
around the ad the ankles alright because

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.160 
around the ad the ankles alright because
that's<00:02:42.310> where<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.640> way<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.909> is<00:02:43.170> basically

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that's where the way it is basically

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.229 
that's where the way it is basically
straight<00:02:44.470> down<00:02:44.650> entity<00:02:45.069> into<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.459> ground<00:02:45.700> all

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
straight down entity into the ground all

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.369 
straight down entity into the ground all
right<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.599> we<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.870> we've<00:02:47.019> got<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.200> stay

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
right as we know we've got to stay

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.599 
right as we know we've got to stay
grounded<00:02:47.620> we've<00:02:47.950> got<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.129> maintain<00:02:48.459> our

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
grounded we've got to maintain our

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.369 
grounded we've got to maintain our
balance<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.720> you're<00:02:49.930> gonna<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.260> that

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
balance here so you're gonna see that

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.949 
balance here so you're gonna see that
both<00:02:50.650> both<00:02:51.159> knees<00:02:51.459> as<00:02:52.030> both<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:52.599> I<00:02:52.750> turn

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
both both knees as both as I turn

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.039 
both both knees as both as I turn
properly<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:55.120> leg<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.569> coming<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:55.989> a

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
properly this this leg is coming in a

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.509 
properly this this leg is coming in a
little<00:02:56.109> bit<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.470> way<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.920> my<00:02:57.069> weight<00:02:57.250> goes<00:02:57.430> a

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
little bit this way as my weight goes a

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.619 
little bit this way as my weight goes a
little<00:02:57.579> bit<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:57.969> inside<00:02:58.269> but<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.480> don't

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
little bit to the inside but I don't

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.879 
little bit to the inside but I don't
ever<00:02:58.750> pick<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.079> heel<00:02:59.230> off<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.409> ground<00:02:59.500> and

ever pick my heel off the ground and

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.009 
ever pick my heel off the ground and
it's<00:03:00.250> rotating<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.359> rotating<00:03:01.870> and

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
it's rotating and it's rotating and

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's rotating and it's rotating and
staying<00:03:02.470> around<00:03:02.859> this<00:03:03.220> ankle<00:03:03.670> with<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.000> nice

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
staying around this ankle with the nice

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.420 
staying around this ankle with the nice
play<00:03:04.389> and<00:03:04.420> flexed<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.109> staying<00:03:05.709> pivoting

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
play and flexed and staying pivoting

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.159 
play and flexed and staying pivoting
rotating<00:03:07.180> around<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.450> angle<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> speak

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
rotating around this angle so to speak

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.140 
rotating around this angle so to speak
all<00:03:08.709> right<00:03:08.859> so<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.010> rotate<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.579> way<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:10.000> once

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
all right so I rotate this way then once

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.240 
all right so I rotate this way then once
I<00:03:10.269> start<00:03:10.480> swinging<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:11.290> gonna<00:03:11.530> snow<00:03:11.769> rotate

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
I start swinging it's gonna snow rotate

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.949 
I start swinging it's gonna snow rotate
they're<00:03:12.730> gonna<00:03:12.849> rotate<00:03:13.090> exactly<00:03:13.689> the<00:03:13.780> other

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
they're gonna rotate exactly the other

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.140 
they're gonna rotate exactly the other
way<00:03:14.049> around<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.500> ankle<00:03:14.859> all<00:03:15.370> right<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.700> so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
way around the ankle all right and so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.640 
way around the ankle all right and so
I'm<00:03:16.269> rotating<00:03:16.419> around<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.930> ankles<00:03:17.260> what<00:03:17.620> I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
I'm rotating around the ankles what I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.369

to move forward a little bit it's gone

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.129 
to move forward a little bit it's gone
from<00:03:54.669> the<00:03:54.849> arches<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.780> moving<00:03:56.079> out

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
from the arches and it's moving out

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.899 
from the arches and it's moving out
towards<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.530> ball<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:56.919> foot<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:57.430> if<00:03:57.790> it

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
towards the ball of the foot and if it

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.189 
towards the ball of the foot and if it
starts<00:03:58.150> moving<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.629> ball<00:03:58.810> you're<00:03:58.989> very

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
starts moving to the ball you're very

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.119 
starts moving to the ball you're very
susceptible<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.829> falling<00:04:00.099> down<00:04:00.370> okay<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.359> so

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
susceptible to falling down okay and so

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.680 
susceptible to falling down okay and so
vice-versa<00:04:03.129> if<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.400> turn<00:04:03.609> too<00:04:03.819> much<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.329> this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
vice-versa if you turn too much and this

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.119 
vice-versa if you turn too much and this
this<00:04:04.930> leg<00:04:05.139> came<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.500> too<00:04:05.620> much<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:05.919> one's

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
this leg came in too much this one's

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.559 
this leg came in too much this one's
straight<00:04:06.310> up<00:04:06.459> too<00:04:06.579> much<00:04:06.699> and<00:04:06.909> the<00:04:07.209> leg<00:04:07.359> this

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
straight up too much and the leg this

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.430 
straight up too much and the leg this
straightens<00:04:07.900> up<00:04:07.959> but<00:04:08.079> that's<00:04:08.139> one<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.349> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
straightens up but that's one of the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.319 
straightens up but that's one of the
biggest<00:04:08.590> things<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:08.919> see<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:09.790> lessons<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
biggest things I see and in lessons is

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.449 
biggest things I see and in lessons is
and<00:04:11.199> that's<00:04:11.409> a<00:04:11.500> classic<00:04:11.859> case<00:04:11.979> of<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.280> is

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
and that's a classic case of that is

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.920 
and that's a classic case of that is
your<00:04:12.909> turn<00:04:13.090> hips<00:04:13.329> too<00:04:13.479> much<00:04:13.599> it's<00:04:13.750> going<00:04:13.870> to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
your turn hips too much it's going to

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.179 
your turn hips too much it's going to
pull<00:04:14.079> that<00:04:14.169> leg<00:04:14.379> straight<00:04:14.620> right<00:04:14.859> as<00:04:15.010> long<00:04:15.069> as

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
pull that leg straight right as long as

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.279 
pull that leg straight right as long as
this<00:04:15.729> legs<00:04:16.000> attached<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.449> this<00:04:16.570> hip<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
this legs attached to this hip and the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.479 
this legs attached to this hip and the
back<00:04:17.470> hip<00:04:17.650> turns<00:04:17.889> too<00:04:18.070> much<00:04:18.220> it<00:04:18.370> can

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
back hip turns too much it can

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.649 
back hip turns too much it can
straighten<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.880> hip<00:04:19.000> out<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.359> that's

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
straighten the hip out and that's

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.020 
straighten the hip out and that's
pushing<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.049> forward<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.620> now<00:04:20.979> now<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:21.549> that

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
pushing you forward and now now if that

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.360 
pushing you forward and now now if that
happens<00:04:22.449> this<00:04:23.380> like<00:04:23.650> straightens<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.250> one

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
happens this like straightens that one

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.560 
happens this like straightens that one
it's<00:04:24.460> going<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.639> force<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.000> one<00:04:25.180> down<00:04:25.330> more

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
it's going to force this one down more

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.089 
it's going to force this one down more
so<00:04:25.930> where's<00:04:26.139> my<00:04:26.259> weight<00:04:26.440> right<00:04:26.470> now<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:26.979> all
