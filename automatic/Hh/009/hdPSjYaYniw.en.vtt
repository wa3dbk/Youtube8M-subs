monosodium glutamate

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
monosodium glutamate
it's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> powerful<00:00:24.660> flavor<00:00:24.900> enhancer<00:00:25.380> that's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it's a powerful flavor enhancer that's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
it's a powerful flavor enhancer that's
added<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.160> many<00:00:26.310> foods<00:00:26.670> particularly

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
added to so many foods particularly

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
added to so many foods particularly
processed<00:00:27.990> junk<00:00:28.230> food<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.740> despite<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> fact

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
processed junk food and despite the fact

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
processed junk food and despite the fact
that<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> FDA<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.599> classified<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.320> safe

that the FDA is classified it is safe

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
that the FDA is classified it is safe
it's<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.850> detrimental<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.420> our

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it's actually really detrimental to our

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
it's actually really detrimental to our
health<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.200> should<00:00:34.410> never<00:00:34.559> eat<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.000> so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
health and we should never eat it so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
health and we should never eat it so
it's<00:00:36.120> supposedly<00:00:36.390> safe<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> eat<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.350> studies

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's supposedly safe to eat but studies

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's supposedly safe to eat but studies
have<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.920> shown<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.370> msg<00:00:38.790> messes<00:00:39.270> with

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
have actually shown that msg messes with

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.639 
have actually shown that msg messes with
our<00:00:39.450> glutamate<00:00:39.960> receptors<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.500> our<00:00:40.590> brain

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
our glutamate receptors in our brain

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
our glutamate receptors in our brain
which<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.700> cause<00:00:41.969> serious

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
which can then cause serious

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
which can then cause serious
neurological<00:00:43.140> diseases<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.980> Alzheimer's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
neurological diseases like Alzheimer's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.630 
neurological diseases like Alzheimer's
Parkinson's<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.960> Huntington's<00:00:46.520> this<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
Parkinson's and Huntington's this is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
Parkinson's and Huntington's this is
because<00:00:47.910> MSG<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.629> an<00:00:48.840> excitotoxin<00:00:49.200> which

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
because MSG is an excitotoxin which

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.560 
because MSG is an excitotoxin which
means<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.430> excites<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.030> cells<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
means that over excites your cells the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
means that over excites your cells the
point<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.960> damage<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.500> death<00:00:52.739> causing<00:00:53.550> brain

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
point of damage or death causing brain

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
learning disabilities and the worst

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.400 
learning disabilities and the worst
thing<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.390> MSG<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.960> everywhere

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
thing is that MSG is everywhere

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.170 
thing is that MSG is everywhere
especially<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.399> processed<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.000> fast

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
especially there in processed and fast

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
especially there in processed and fast
foods<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> very<00:01:04.379> powerful

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
foods because it's a very powerful

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
foods because it's a very powerful
flavor<00:01:05.040> enhancer<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.119> means<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
flavor enhancer that means it has the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
flavor enhancer that means it has the
power<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> make<00:01:07.020> poor<00:01:07.290> quality<00:01:07.590> crappy<00:01:08.100> food
