 to make it easy, I left nothing behind 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.680
 boil and I'm going through the wicks 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.220
 girls 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.810
 I found in the store of Asian products 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.000
 very curious and funny is that you will 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.660
 passing the oil 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.180

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.490
 I'm going because the little tock and let 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.090
 20 minutes was funny because in the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 ubi channel she put a little bag 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.480
 because she had nothing to 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.240
 at home 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.450
 she said it has the same effect then 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.700
 I'm putting on this little bit, you think 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.030
 I'll let sold emerging as 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.470
 do something little hi girls 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.990
 okay 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.270
 so today it 's another day I came here filming 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.820
 the light of day for you to get the result 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.290
 hair so what I did I 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.570
 I double- sided my hair with shampoo 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.490
 3 shampoo and I did not feel need to 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.160
 use the conditioner because it really 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.040
 he was very soft coconut oil 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.410
 left my hair very soft 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.050
 so just rinsing twice was the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.630
 enough then I dried my 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.600
 hair because it was late yesterday too 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.550
 drying with the dryer and giving 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.910
 a past in school and I did not hand 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.420
 I made you a plate so you can see the result. 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.330
 as it was because the little chap 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.310
 she already gives a lot of shine in her hair 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.830
 so I wanted you to see the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.739
 natural result without chaplets 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.190
 Look, he was like this, I liked it a lot. 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:33.090
 because my hair was very opaque 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.489
 he was a little dull like that and I 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.670
 I thought that after he arrived at our 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.600
 It looks like the hair stays soft. 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.110
 really mole same hair and I'm 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.810
 feeling much softer because before 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.120
 pass the coconut oil or your save yourself and 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.019
 dried out 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.959
 I do not know, so you know a lot 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.200
 I like girls like her 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.810
 have you learned my hair a few times already? 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.540
 sleep I do not know if there is more or if it stayed 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.750
 some brand but I already did several things 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.720
 and I still feel it very soft 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.720
 very malleable that he would be the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.479
 he does not give that hair 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.000
 static enables very malleable 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.430
 so this is it girls I hope you 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.560
