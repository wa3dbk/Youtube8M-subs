marks it either four rounds today and do
a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.880> stuff<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.179> in<00:02:00.659> coil<00:02:01.320> has<00:02:01.560> on

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
a little much stuff to in coil has on

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.700 
a little much stuff to in coil has on
something<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.179> back<00:02:03.499> we're<00:02:04.499> going<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
something when I was back we're going to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.520 
something when I was back we're going to
fix<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.069> is<00:02:05.249> postural<00:02:06.060> alignment<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> aren't

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
fix that is postural alignment so aren't

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.100 
fix that is postural alignment so aren't
you<00:02:07.619> turn<00:02:07.829> sideways<00:02:08.100> or<00:02:08.940> inside<00:02:09.210> of<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> see

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you turn sideways or inside of this see

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.220 
you turn sideways or inside of this see
how<00:02:10.229> his<00:02:10.410> head

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
how his head

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.580 
how his head
and<00:02:12.190> goes<00:02:12.519> out<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.060> then<00:02:13.180> comes<00:02:13.420> back<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.870> tuck

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and goes out and then comes back in tuck

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.350 
and goes out and then comes back in tuck
your<00:02:14.680> chin<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.159> bring<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.400> back<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.269> it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
your chin in and bring it back so it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.670 
your chin in and bring it back so it
takes<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.659> lot<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> effort<00:02:17.290> for<00:02:17.470> him<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
takes a lot of effort for him to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.119 
takes a lot of effort for him to
straighten<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:18.909> I<00:02:19.349> mean<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.470> could<00:02:20.769> be<00:02:21.099> a

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
straighten out I mean it could be a

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.089 
straighten out I mean it could be a
slight<00:02:21.580> kyphosis<00:02:22.180> I'm<00:02:22.870> hoping<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.560> not<00:02:23.650> but

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
slight kyphosis I'm hoping it's not but

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.710 
slight kyphosis I'm hoping it's not but
either<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.700> we're<00:02:25.030> catching<00:02:25.360> whatever<00:02:25.480> he

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
either way we're catching whatever he
