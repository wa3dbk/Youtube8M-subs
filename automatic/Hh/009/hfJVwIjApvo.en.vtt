opportunity that I have for this nail

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.660 
opportunity that I have for this nail
polish<00:05:30.420> is<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:31.260> fact<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.560> they<00:05:31.770> do<00:05:31.830> dry<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.640> a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
polish is the fact that they do dry to a

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.390 
polish is the fact that they do dry to a
semi<00:05:33.120> matte<00:05:33.360> finish<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.350> definitely<00:05:34.950> be<00:05:35.160> sure

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
semi matte finish so definitely be sure

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.790 
semi matte finish so definitely be sure
to<00:05:35.610> have<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:35.820> really<00:05:36.120> good<00:05:36.300> topcoat<00:05:36.840> nearby<00:05:37.200> but

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
to have a really good topcoat nearby but

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.920 
to have a really good topcoat nearby but
otherwise<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:38.550> love<00:05:38.970> these<00:05:39.120> two<00:05:39.330> colors<00:05:39.360> and
