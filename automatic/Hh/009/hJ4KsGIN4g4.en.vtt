00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to all these reptile fans so we 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.639
 finds himself for a new video of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.639
 presentation of another of my terrarium 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.529
 and a newcomer I had 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.269
 yesterday so here is so I present to you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.740
 but fizi natus caussens innus so 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:28.679
 more commonly called water dragon 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.800
 so I present you digitobis one 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.010
 that I have for a year and about two 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 month about 1 something close 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.800
 see here it is there is a little more 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 young than the one I even recovered 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.680
 that we just named marleix who 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.039
 is a beautiful cushy a year and a half who 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.199
 is very affectionate tribute eat very 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.840
 well and no problem so we go in 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.379
 this video talk about maintenance 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 physical order to make it of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.880
 light of the heat lamp and so on 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 hygrometry temperatures 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 so here is first of all it you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 will need a lamp uv b 10% so then 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.780
 ideal for physics and 5% but 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 it is true that we have in discussing with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.290
 a lot of breeders they noticed that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.760
 in lots in quotation marks 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.830
 quite bulky it was better to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.740
 put 10 % because the rays are 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.150
 more diffuse inside is diffused 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 better inside the terrarium if you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.510
 so I want to choose a heron 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.890
 10% 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.550
 they did not octopus it bounced for 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.160
 hundred with a shocking light bulb alone 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.260
 work 100 watts so for the wadding 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.540
 like for the last video it's not 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.770
 because of the volume of your terrarium 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.170
 the bigger it is, the more you will need 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.850
 of box to heat so me my 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:05.050
 terrarium it's 1 m 35 by 55 by 55 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.020
 so here we go 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.980
 the ignatus fate becomes quite big so 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.710
 for now will be silent is well suited 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.990
 and there are no worries but in the future I 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.890
 will build him a terrarium with a 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.800
 artificial bat mode water basin but a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.870
 decor is planted with waterfalls etc 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.300
 so I have a little bit of work but we're going 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.640
 to say that within a year 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.540
 it should be over because there is 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 really a lot of things to do 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.210
 so in a year they will have 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.410
 almost their adult size this will be the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.180
 time to put them in a field 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.580
 well as it takes for them to have a 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.240
 good water tank as it plunges 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.190
 and it's for him to be fine so that's it 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.890
 so to know for girls and us 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.990
 as seen their number to gondo it takes a 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.310
 large water tank so the water tanks I 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.630
 advise you to take one at home 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.300
 or to find in the trade because 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.510
 that the water tanks exo tera shaped 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.080
 stone or what are certainly decorative 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.340
 but there are more than 90 to care for them 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.960
 they are not big enough for them 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.150
 physical must know that the phillies 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.910
 love to bathe every day there 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.500
 so go one needs a tray that feints the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.050
 length of their bodies so that they get there 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.730
 bathe funeral without problem so 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.300
 I recommend a large water tank 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.800
 at home it's just as good 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.739
 then I recommend a terrarium 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.970
 planted then at the level of the two there 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.530
 now it's a bit more complicated 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.640
 since we have to deal with both 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.100
 plants and animals 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.290
 but I recommend it because suddenly it 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.810
 holds a much better hygrometry in 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.370
 does natural plants like you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.560
 see the drops of water there it is 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.060
 soon 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.130
 yeah that's well over a half 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.420
 hour that I sprayed because I have not 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.099
 again 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.110
 the misting plant of which jérôme 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.819
 is still in the hand so it's already done 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.580
 a big fat half hour and you 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.780
 see my land is still wet 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.250
 it shows anyway I do not have 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.390
 need to necessarily show you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.310
 see that there are tastes of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.840
 all over 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.430
 there you can see that big but 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.390
 sort is at 60 almost 65% a little bit in 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.390
 below so here is so at each ad and 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.280
 authorization in my terrarium therefore wrong 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.590
 according to fogger of course no 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.160
 popularize me I burn put 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.540
 finally I spray with mine about 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.690
 two minutes in the field because 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.270
 suddenly blow or it does not humidify 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.730
 enough so here's for the ben substrate 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.470
 I bought a substrate in store so 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.530
 it's a kind of superfine peat in 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.210
 did it was dehydrated it's a 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.370
 small cube small dehydrated bricks 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 that I mixed with water in celebration 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.760
 and we get a little more than 8 liters of 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.290
 this mix in the end so that allowed me 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.210
 to make terrariums with I thought 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.889
 not that it was as good at the level of 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.050
 report so 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.810
 so that's so this month I've been pretty 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.639
 satisfied that because it holds 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.550
 really a super good hygrometry and 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.590
 to know that it is a good substrate for 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 plants so plants can get 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.640
 develop problem 220 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.640
 so this is the ideal humidity for 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.789
 ignatus girls is 70% so that's 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.260
 true that central fogging and you 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.580
 are going to need to spray 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.470
 several times a day the ideal is 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.770
 really to stay at 70% pretty much 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.120
 so constantly 60 between 60 and 70% 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.250
 constant but it's almost impossible 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.320
 because when you Puil the museum 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.020
 big but tri will go up 1 5-10 minutes 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.039
 very quickly and will go back down to 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.320
 small until your next 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.990
 spraying so for now I 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.400
 am about 5.6 spray per 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.620
 day to ever go down below 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.770
 Finally rarely below 60 on 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.270
 to say below so I go down to 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.110
 know that the hygrometry of France and 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.720
 about 50 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.630
 so it is rare to go below 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.130
 except in the fields where it is very 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.479
 hot where there is a lot of wood 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.250
 the interior because the wood absorbs 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.360
 moisture so that can go down in 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.699
 below so it's very dangerous for 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.130
 the physics really have to stay the 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:18.020
 more possible near the 60 70 so that's it 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.430
 then at the level of the diet 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.039
 it's simple it's finally crickets 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:31.460
 like all lizards 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:32.900
 almost 90% cricket about it 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.940
 must know that the physical hiatus 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.570
 loves everything that is fish and 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.130
 sea ​​food 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:42.020
 so after everyone knows each his tastes 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.820
 finally each of them we taste a month 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.720
 for example bomba for marlene is the one 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.800
 that you see in front of the bola I 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.060
 tried I the old men I have 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.360
 tried last night plus do eat a 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.039
 mold 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.690
 they do not pay the habit visibly 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.050
 the blue rabbits he has arranged crickets 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.750
 worry- free a cockroach also numbered 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.310
 so you see right behind him 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.909
 there is no problem it is already 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.050
 some time that I'm used to and 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.490
 his cute sin is the mussels so 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.760
 it is true that he loves it there is no 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.140
 problem 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.850
 it's like a treat, so 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.500
 not to abuse it either I advise you 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.390
 to give one to two a week 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.830
 maximum because it's still enough 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.780
 rich is still quite rich in 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.520
 proteins and where so good one should not 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.290
 not too much too much to abuse I you 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.930
 maximum advise of three per week 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:33.409
 do not go beyond so here is 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.849
 Thu 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.580
 I hope this video has taught you 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:40.129
 a few things to maintain 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.589
 your physics 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:44.449
 So here I am, I'll meet you again for 

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:47.149
 a next video that I would do on 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:50.059
 cricket breeding as well as some 

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:51.860
 other insects that you can find 

00:07:50.059 --> 00:07:56.269
 in shops or on the internet 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.889
 eventually gave that they are 

00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:01.399
 completely different at the level 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:03.860
 nutritious and so on by briand so 

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:05.779
 here I hope this video has learned 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.489
 a lot of things I wish you a 

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:11.319
 have a good day or a good evening and 

00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:11.319
 do not forget subscriber you are going hi
