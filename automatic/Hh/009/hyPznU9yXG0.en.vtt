bigger so while those are cooking we
don't<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.769> worry<00:03:26.950> about<00:03:27.010> anything<00:03:27.489> else

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
don't have to worry about anything else

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.050 
don't have to worry about anything else
at<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.780> time<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.410> want<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> make<00:03:30.519> sure<00:03:30.550> that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
at this time I want to make sure that

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.150 
at this time I want to make sure that
when<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:31.870> start<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.260> stir<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.860> kind<00:03:33.070> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
when we start to stir it it kind of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400 
when we start to stir it it kind of
gives<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:33.940> cheesy<00:03:34.480> effect<00:03:34.900> before<00:03:35.320> we

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
gives that that cheesy effect before we

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.250 
gives that that cheesy effect before we
start<00:03:35.680> chatting<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.390> salsa<00:03:37.690> simply

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
start chatting in the salsa simply

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.290 
start chatting in the salsa simply
because<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:38.680> don't<00:03:38.860> want<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.340> too<00:03:40.120> much

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
because we don't want it to be too much

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.820 
because we don't want it to be too much
salsa<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:40.930> enough<00:03:41.200> cheese<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:41.620> too<00:03:41.709> much

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
salsa and not enough cheese or too much

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.440 
salsa and not enough cheese or too much
easier<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.280> ourselves<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:42.820> we<00:03:42.970> kind<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.239> want

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
easier on ourselves so we kind of want

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.729 
easier on ourselves so we kind of want
to<00:03:43.540> make<00:03:43.720> sure<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.380> it's<00:03:44.620> consistent<00:03:46.739> now

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
to make sure that it's consistent now

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.290 
to make sure that it's consistent now
what<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.250> do<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.519> we<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.730> go<00:03:48.880> ahead<00:03:48.940> and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
what we can do is we can go ahead and

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.800 
what we can do is we can go ahead and
start<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.860> cook<00:03:51.870> our<00:03:52.870> Roundy's<00:03:54.480> once<00:03:55.480> again

together<00:05:42.220> I'm<00:05:42.370> just<00:05:42.400> gonna<00:05:42.669> put<00:05:42.790> just<00:05:42.910> a

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
together I'm just gonna put just a

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.670 
together I'm just gonna put just a
little<00:05:43.120> bit<00:05:43.840> more<00:05:43.990> in<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:47.200> then<00:05:47.290> I<00:05:47.380> think

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
little bit more in and then I think

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.900 
little bit more in and then I think
we'll<00:05:47.919> actually<00:05:48.100> be<00:05:48.370> done<00:05:48.669> with<00:05:48.910> this<00:05:49.060> one<00:05:49.530> and

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
we'll actually be done with this one and

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.720 
we'll actually be done with this one and
altogether<00:05:51.910> this<00:05:52.419> takes<00:05:52.780> what<00:05:53.770> maybe<00:05:54.190> 10<00:05:54.490> 15

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
altogether this takes what maybe 10 15

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.879 
altogether this takes what maybe 10 15
minutes

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
minutes

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.559 
minutes
I<00:05:56.919> mean<00:05:57.490> you're<00:05:57.639> not<00:05:57.759> overworking<00:05:58.300> yourself

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569
