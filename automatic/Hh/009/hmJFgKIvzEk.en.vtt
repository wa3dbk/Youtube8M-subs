00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.140
 hello everyone and welcome to a video 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.420
 more than poc and ocean on this occasion os 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.130
 I bring a fight in pokemon x 6 but in 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.900
 a combat any but the end of 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.700
 one of the the game tournaments that 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.770
 will hold a port in Spain to 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.109
 select the 50 people who 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.910
 would go to the online phase and good without 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.189
 more preambles let's move on to comment 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.830
 the fight against javi in ​​the first 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.199
 turn started with aek islands and radon hit and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.720
 me with cangas can and root mushrooms what 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.640
 was to make it's surprise to your mouse and fire 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.500
 fatua x predicting that the area 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.140
 real shield but what he did was change 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.030
 to x them by am a bus and also protected 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.070
 to mouse so in this turn it did not happen 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.629
 the great thing more than at least can 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.420
 burn a bus that good is a pokémon 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.190
 quite annoying and convenient to take it off 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.500
 above, as quickly as possible 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.410
 but as I said before out of there 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.050
 the great thing happened in the next 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 what I did was retribution am a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.430
 bus because like I said before I wanted to 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.190
 remove it as soon as possible and I threw 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.230
 hydro pumps to your mouse but the change has 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.760
 broken by aek islands that to which 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.610
 obviously it was not going to be almost nothing 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.410
 since it was in shield form and in addition 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.020
 and the friend took a good blow from 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.970
 retribution but there is no where could 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.100
 have a jagged helmet so hurt my 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.310
 cangas kan and besides then he made me 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 spores and I slept him so good at 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.160
 this situation was pretty bad 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.840
 because I had cangas here in front of me yet 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.160
 x those that could make me holy sword and 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 kill melo but good I left it there and what 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.300
 what I did was low blow with loads so 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.080
 that obviously was not going to wake up 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.810
 because I just went to sleep and I spoke with 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.220
 because I wanted to get rid of 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.100
 sund mundus to prevent me from doing 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.200
 spores or I have fairing and good what 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.229
 he did with his eagle is evidently was 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.020
 holy sword to my cangas kan but 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.180
 surprisingly I do not know how I could 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 resist the blow endure if I do not 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.550
 I'm wrong with 9 ps or so and it was pretty 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.420
 surprising because he is not trained in 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.789
 ps or in defense or anything like that 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.110
 then the sac sugar gascan and arrived 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.050
 there was to try to do low blow to see 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.180
 if he woke up but it was not like that he 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.680
 his part made fist increase to me 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.900
 cangas what I thought was going to be 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
 surprise to finish killing him and there 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.709
 The truth is that he did risk a lot 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.180
 because they sing to me you cangas that could 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.400
 to have awakened and hit him 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.380
 low to the Xs and have killed him 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.620
 but hey, the move went well 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.440
 rose to more one the attack with cangas kan 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.769
 and I then did 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.180
 idrovo plus which I made fire missed if 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.450
 I'm not wrong if I made a facto game 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.310
 to take life for the burn and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.110
 also reduce the attack that had 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.930
 increased and all that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.730
 and well I shot with the shadow with x 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150
 that did not make me long enough 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.780
 well and then I pulled out to do something to do 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 earthquake and thus be able to kill x the already 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.220
 quite effective but I did not fall for it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.890
 I am here I could have enough guard and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.280
 this turn was pretty bad for me 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.920
 I already gave everything for lost because 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.990
 also in this same turn his basket does not 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.850
 besides, it was not the retribution but 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.890
 that was the one of jim in the image and also 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.510
 that he had the attack raised by ball 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.850
 increase with the with being burned by 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.650
 the image would take away twice as much but 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.630
 least I had to have commented and the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.330
 rough and that took some life and 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.510
 then he also threw bomb to see 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.410
 if I could kill him at once but the very 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.830
 firecracker resisted with a ps and annoyed me 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.120
 quite that then I took out the heel 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.130
 flame were only me and these 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.989
 two pokemon and I thought that in this turn 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.820
 there are those who would use them as a real shield on their own 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.739
 that did envite and not or so if what 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.950
 did under the high nascar fairies to 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.020
 take it off on me hit me over there 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.940
 so since I did not want to risk it, use 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.860
 protection color 2 so that its so 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.629
 basket finished ends dying 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.040
 for the burn but then I saw that the 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.870
 two had attacked me has broken more and that 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.239
 could have taken me out of the middle 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.459
 but hey I did not expect that so 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.470
 It was very attached and this turn was the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.390
 that he decided the whole problem is that 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.130
 I had just used protection and I knew 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.019
 perfectly that in this turn the area 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.030
 real shield so if it attacked x the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.389
 apart from reducing the attack two levels 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.979
 he would use lightning with his broken and kill already in 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 my heel play but good but I will use 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.419
 protection because I did not have another 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.320
 alternative and had 50% chance 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:34.979
 of hitting right and I could throw it 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.440
 hydropumps u broken and then on the in the 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.419
 next turn I try to do the same 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 he made me a real shield but he did not 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.770
 the ruling worked, the attack did not have the 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.530
 same luck as me and my heel frame 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 ended with that of an Indian stake then its 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.729
 vote made me lightning and killed me to end heel 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.950
 but obviously I did not have anything else 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.900
 what to do because I knew that I was broken 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.110
 I still had to use hydro pump 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.419
 and well it was a great combat the truth 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.880
 although I admit that I had a lot of 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.340
 luck in the end with what happened but 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.710
 well it was last I wanted to fire the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.229
 video saying that I'm sorry for having 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.460
 taken so much in uploading videos but between 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.199
 some things and others it has been leaving 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.759
 everything to the end and that's what has 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.770
 past and I also take the opportunity to say 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.750
 that on November 1 we are going to do 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.460
 a tournament in retirement in madrid in the 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.930
 that we will use the classic red pokemon 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 blue and yellow and we will fight with the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.860
 gameboy the link cable and that left you all 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.840

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.850
 video and see if you dare to spend 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.720
 over there and participate a greeting and up
