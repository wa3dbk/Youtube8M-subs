00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.560
 of shadows that is a vissum so 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.100

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.260
 tones of the eyes or labial then 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.089
 for that I put them in the photos I want 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.499
 thank you all because almost 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.769
 we are reaching two thousand 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:44.839

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.269
 It's something that makes me very happy and 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.420
 I want to thank everyone and also 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.440
 I want to send a greeting to Nancy that in 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.299
 facebook is choco towers friend greeting 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.039
 and good this continuing with the video if 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.699
 you want to see the makeup then stay 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.699
 watching the video 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.170
 I will start applying as always my 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.329
 first of shadows of him and I do it for 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 may the shadows last me much longer 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.789
 time and do not believe me folds since 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.609
 I have a fatty eyelid so then 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.729
 I'm going to blur it all over my eyelid 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.659
 where will I apply shadow also for 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.969
 the bottom 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.159
 good for all this makeup like 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.049
 you will see it is in neutral tones the only 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.170
 the policy that I am using is this 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.600
 I think that it is number 4 and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.209
 is the only one that I will use and the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.819
 first tone that I will take will be that and that is 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.849
 a coffee tone super clarito with a little 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.759
 of brightness but you do not notice much I'll 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:55.490
 apply it with this brush that is flat and 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.859
 It's big enough to cover all the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.840
 eyelid and what I will do is apply it in 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:06.300
 all my eyelid up to my basin 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.030
 and good as you see if you notice the color 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.970
 and polino just a little bit not much my 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 next shadow will be this dark coffee 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.910
 I'm going to apply it with the same brush 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.890
 that should be to mark my basin 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.260
 following it naturally I will not create 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.940
 no way or lengthen anything 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.200
 simply there I am going to apply 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.120
 and I'm going to take some of this black in 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.560
 combination with the shadow coffee I'm going to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 mark this basin 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.080
 I'm going to take this brush to blur 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.230
 I'm going to bite this shadow of veronica with 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.020
 which is pink for something like that and with this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.670
 brochita that is and gives it is as if 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.070
 out for the blush but in little I'm going 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.590
 to apply it under the eyebrow and in my 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.270
 tear I'm always shaking between 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.510
 every shadow that he applied so as not to throw 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.120
 also here in my lacrimal 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.030
 and now I'm going to do my delineated with 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.530
 this maybelline gel eyeliner 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.319
 study that I love it lasts a lot 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.420
 time and I'm going to do it with this brochita 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.400
 little girl and well then I'm going to take the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.349
 product and I'm going to do my delineated this 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.650
 occasion is going to be a pretty outlined 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.140
 marked 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.140
 so I like to start with the tail 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.390
 and with what I had left over I will apply it in 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.880
 the bottom part 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.459
 in the lower lashes and I'm going to 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.580
 sink the delineated with the part of 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.580
 down 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.190
 without reaching the beginning of the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.269
 lower lashes and to take this 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.269
 brochita to blur 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.860
 I'm going to go back to my pallet and I'm going to 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.000
 take a little bit of the black shadow 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.340
 I will mainly put it in the 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.340
 corner and well I'm going in 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.640
 and now with this brush that is different 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.640
 They have long hairs and they help me 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.380
 blur I'm going to apply this shade brown 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.190
 it's pretty clear what I 'll do 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.190
 blur 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.549
 that you do not see a marked line or anything 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.549
 of that 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.469
 I'm going to take this adhara pencil for the 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.719
 lower water line and this is the tone 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:59.680
 I'm going to apply it in this part to open 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.680
 more my eye 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.229
 Now I'm going to take those false eyelashes 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.050
 that I bought them by ebay and I'm going to take 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.669
 is up here that as you can see 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.930
 pretty natural but it's going to give me 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.930
 volume and will start 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.780
 and now I'm going to apply a little 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.930
 of mask in the part of the base of the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.690
 eyelashes to join the natural ones with the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.920
 ribs to stay a little bit 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.920
 the bottom part also 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.900
 Well that's how the eyes look 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.260
 finished as you see is a pretty look 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.180
 simple to do but the trick is in 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.180
 the delineated and in the false eyelashes 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.450
 because I'm going to use it will be this truth that 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.910
 it is advances 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.040
 geimer brands inc tip this be the 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.290

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.960

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.360

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.410
 very small blush 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.919
 this time I will be applying 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.740
 these two lipsticks that some adore and 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.639

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.639
 38

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.270
 that he admires 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.760

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.060
 shown in another video chop first the 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.060
