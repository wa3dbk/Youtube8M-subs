00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
paypal account but by default it is five

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.090 
paypal account but by default it is five
dollars<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.710> what<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
dollars and that's what I'm going to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.740 
dollars and that's what I'm going to
keep<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.520> unless<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.030> decided<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.480> change

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
keep it out unless I decided to change

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
keep it out unless I decided to change
it<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.140> let<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.410> guys<00:02:19.560> pick<00:02:19.830> your<00:02:20.010> own

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it and let you guys pick your own

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.550 
it and let you guys pick your own
increments<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.600> think<00:02:21.810> five<00:02:22.020> dollars<00:02:22.410> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
increments but I think five dollars is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
increments but I think five dollars is
fair<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.070> what<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.880> do<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:24.210> fill<00:02:24.600> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
fair and what you do is you just fill it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
fair and what you do is you just fill it
out<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.170> once<00:02:25.500> you're<00:02:25.650> done<00:02:25.800> filling<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
out and then once you're done filling it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.760
