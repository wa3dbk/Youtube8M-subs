significance might that have well it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.699 
significance might that have well it
seems<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.300> first<00:03:12.600> phenomena<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.410> can<00:03:13.560> see

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
seems like a first phenomena you can see

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.160

is<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:14.070> stood<00:03:14.340> up<00:03:14.489> against

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
is that they stood up against

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.479 
is that they stood up against
institutional<00:03:16.170> discrimination<00:03:16.380> right<00:03:17.220> so

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
institutional discrimination right so

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.670 
institutional discrimination right so
they<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.239> redefine<00:03:18.570> themselves<00:03:19.019> as

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
they have to redefine themselves as

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.080 
they have to redefine themselves as
