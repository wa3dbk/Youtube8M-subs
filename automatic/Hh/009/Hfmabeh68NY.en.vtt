00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.440
 you admit that when I was at school 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.199

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.100
 imperfections lnsp help of 30 that's 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.100

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.250
