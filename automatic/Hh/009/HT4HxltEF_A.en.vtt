00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.440
 Part of ancient times 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.540
 Hunter 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.710
 Even at home 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.109
 This is a video report 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.459
 Range lemon 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.829
 I will see it for the first time, but I did it since last month 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.070
 Is not it 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.040
 It is the first time ecologically, but what kind of taste 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 Do you do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 It's au but it looks like you 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.789
 This is also easy 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.890
 It is an explanation of the drink 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 With honey 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990
 It is written variously 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.690
 This is the name of the raw material 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.499
 A little overwintering screen 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:43.500
 With that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.150
 Because it becomes 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.480
 Can you not read the letter now? 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.990
 later 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.400
 Here 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 energy 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.020
 Well then 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.940
 I think that I would like to drink 33, 32 a day 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 It doesn't come from, but I'm writing soda 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.970
 I'm sorry 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 I raised a little 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.910
 I hear a good sound 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.340
 Speaking of Santa, it is fantag rape 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.039
 Do you think 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.000
 I agree 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.700
 simply 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 Say that 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 Would you like to have some tea 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 ice 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 It will be done when you look through the interaction with the post 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.540
 I can not see the color that I do human resources 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 It's a little more yellowish 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.130
 I think I feel like that though 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.950
 This is a synthetic coloring, so it is not used 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.190
 In color 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.260
 I think it's getting better 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 Then I would like to get a bit 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 US signs 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.269
 8 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.629
 I don't think I've ever drank 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.069
 boy 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.969
 But the same 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.379
 I have nothing to do with tea but maybe 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.379
 lemonade 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.669
 station 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.019
 Mr. General so much 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.679
 It has been fried 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.679
 It is easy to see with s6 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.029
 After all I want cold weather 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.299
 Red star 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.839
 If the head fantag rape both days will not overwinter 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.090
 But the contents of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.090
 Boarded 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.379
 Even though I do not want to show 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.449
 so 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.759
 The sweetness that is not persistent because it feels like 8 days have passed 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.779
 is not it 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.449
 Lol 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.449
 Moderate sweetness, for example moderate carbonation 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.199
 So it's very refreshing and refreshing 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.399
 More than air conditioners and grapes 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 You may want it 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.529
 Well then 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.609
 I think I want to scrutinize it
