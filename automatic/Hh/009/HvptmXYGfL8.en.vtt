00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.540
 e 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.689
 hello to all and before leaving for the 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.849
 paris games week I decided to you 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.860
 do a little video and this time 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.960
 on a console that several people 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.449
 have asked me from elsewhere and it's about 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.580
 the muse or so it's the fat console 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.910
 I'm going to introduce you to everything 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.670
 after 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.170
 and here is the little wonder then 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.910
 a quick look at the packaging 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.760
 and while I show you all that 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.420
 this console was released in 2005 on 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.129
 Japanese soils in the pokemon center 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 that's the outline up and yes certify 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.480
 pokemon center as you see here 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.420
 the little word on the top that really 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.059
 a nice art works of the beast 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.379
 is the famous console so the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.140
 let's find out right now if it's 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.720
 really that so what side is that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.240
 it's more about here then the interior 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.220
 start right away with those who 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.300
 is none other than the charger for the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.380
 console and that is not suitable for our 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.440
 French catches 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.490
 so I will not use it and will stay there 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.110
 in its packaging 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.679
 I will put aside then the rest 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.060
 while before we here here 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.500
 if I can take the stylus 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.069
 out there that's going to be easier as 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.910
 that the style and relief that were 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.750
 in his protection 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:49.099
 so all white the stylus up here a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.140
 nintendo ds wrist strap to the boom of the 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.619
 casserole 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.360
 here is the little dragone would be that I do not 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.670
 never put it will stay in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.599
 its packaging also I do not have any 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.709
 sure but from behind the records and 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.709
 1a - still here 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.200
 this is the first and second while 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.510
 Japanese 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.049
 I put aside too 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.290
 and it will stay that console I think 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:28.480
 there is nothing inside 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.079
 console that is well protected in its 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.459
 packaging is something else too that I 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:39.280
 will remove to better show you the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.690
 console and here is then yes or no he 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.090
 there is not a little problem somewhere 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.650
 there it does not remind you anything this 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.290
 console if I tell you square console 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.780
 orange and yes it's true 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.790
 looks like the wind they're good there we go 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.599
 listen after find you whistle we go 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.389
 find better 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.209
 and here it is if I lean the console well 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:04.000
 in the light here he is the little rascal in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.530
 white so I bring it to you for 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 that you can see him better me he 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.489
 is friendly and very small 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.489
 huh he must do that on the console on 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.170
 hardly see him the poor if not the rose 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.000
 I do not like it too much, but that's 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.500
 a color still quite nice and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.480
 when we think the light looks like 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.940
 that she is going over to the gray so 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.440
 friendly still going inside 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.379
 now rose again and the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.329
 buttons here that are all white and 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.230
 would there be a better tour art that 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.989
 is hiding somewhere 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.449
 yeah up a game shows you from 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.349
 closer to the light here it is in a 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:43.090
 new position 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.280
 the little word and the nintendo ds logo that 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.919
 is at the bottom otherwise nothing but 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:53.199
 from empty or then back the ribs and 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.910
 the l and r buttons in white 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.959
 the pen that hides here in white 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.090
 also and the back of the console 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.810
 nothing at all by artwork daba either 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.400
 who is hiding 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.970
 it is true that it misses here a small 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.669
 little there is so the battery and the logo 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.859
 pokemon center again is the 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.609
 console the console date output in 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.269
 2005 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.709
 this color is fine 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.449
 nice I would have liked to see her at the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.400
 place this pink but hey we can not 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.870
 have everything 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.030
 so here is what this looks like 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.190

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.160
 the current 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.610
