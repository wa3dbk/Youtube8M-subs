00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.399
 chicken skin 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.320
 first of all I spent my chicken under 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.930
 the faucet so that it is all right 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.510

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:03.390
 everywhere I put the little elastic 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.939
 allows to close the chicken and then I 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.380
 well salted all the ribs and the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 chicken is very important 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 there is some that falls on my board so 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 the chicken will continue this dirty and that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.470
 there is I installed my chicken 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.750
 place the chicken on its side in the dish 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 you have to put some small pieces 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.869
 butter on the chicken so that the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.799

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.110
 if you find it a little dry it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.680
 is possible to add a little bit 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.390
