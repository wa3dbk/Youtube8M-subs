00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 and you see it all ingredients 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 a look we need spaghetti on 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.719
 perfect whole spaghetti 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.320
 I want to be healthy but I just have to 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.950
 no more 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120
 then pickled dried tomatoes a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 couple of dads dice 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.369
 whether inserted or by yourself 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.230
 then cut salad salad baby spinach 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 and cola I have such a mixture where 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 the two together already in there is very 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.189
 Practical because if you like a few 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.449
 fresh cocktail tomatoes and nuts of yours 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.520
 choice I have hazelnuts now and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.809
 almonds forest so are also still right 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.989
 good but I have no more 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 and yes, then it is already on the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:48.750
 preparation the noodle will simply follow 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 Packing instructions often during the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.520
 Spaghetti cooking we use the time and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:09.299
 just cut all ingredients small 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:12.710
 I'll start with the nuts first 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710
 next in cocktail tomatoes 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.650
 then some dried tomatoes 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 Then we get a bit fitter from the glass 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:02:08.670
 and give that to our already 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:24.090
 now added to the cut ingredients 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:25.260
 Salat I cut myself but the styles 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.480
 from the leaves because I like that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.770
 You can also forget that 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.770
 leave it if I did not interfere with the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:03:01.530
 Noodles are now layered benches 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.860
 you all just your plate 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.180
 first some spaghetti comes in then 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:18.690
 few of our small cut 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:23.160
 some salad and all that 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.810
 times from the start I now have a lot of work 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.470
 Merging later because of that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 stories 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:47.590
 In that sense , I still have some ingredients 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.920
 the rest of what's up to that 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.030
 whole for two people had plans and 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.209
 the second person is coming soon 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.680
 to eat and make it too loose and it 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.989
 tastes much better looks 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.280
 and if you do it then leave it 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.019
 me know if such tasted 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.530
 good appetite and see you all 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.530
 back soon
