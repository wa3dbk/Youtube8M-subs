00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.619
 hi everyone so despite the 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.590
 cold 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.190
 I have to dismantle optics before 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.510
 bmw of 36 and so I take this opportunity to 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.300
 make a short video show you 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 how's it going the first thing to 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.090
 make 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.640
 can be removed only because 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.280
 we will need to access a thigh 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 who fixes the little one who is right or this 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.199
 small plastic part 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.409
 so we will be embarrassed by his not so 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:10.510
 started removing that so during the na 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:12.640
 vi cruciform one here or there and one has some 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.400
 plastic screw species like that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 so if you get to remove it with 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:26.290
 the cruciform that's it can be unscrewed 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.430
 this one she's all gobble manage if 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.430
 that's how I could take 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:40.469
 a knife blade said dumbfounded where the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.170
 party a little come out and after 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:47.899
 Normally you arrive at the tour at 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.899
 the hand a pass 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.119
 it's a plastic con thing that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.590
 break easily so be careful 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.810
 but that's all there is so I dream 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.860
 to hide I show you taken the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.189
 Next once you have removed 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:27.799
 all rage and again these two of 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:27.799
 stuff like that makes them go fishing 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.239
 here 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:45.000
 which will allow us to finally reach 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.000
 I'm going back this life that offered 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.540
 this was just to be able to access 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.480
 to this glide good it goes easy 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.130
 with what's embarrassing it's not you 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.330
 anyway there will be need to do that 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 to access each time so 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:11.940
 then there will be seven screws there will be 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:14.459
 this one this one is a keel and me 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.470
 there is one basically really in the bottom 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.070
 of this hole what is it then one each 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.440
 side but the other is 8 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:28.050
 so you're going to need an extension 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.769
 to be able to access all the way down 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.730
 with 2.8 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.040
 so the clichÃ©s you'll see after 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.120
 it's going to come all the vices looks like 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.890
 that there are 4 but the one that is in 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.810
 this hole I can not get out because 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.160
 we do not want to have access 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.550
 be careful when taking out the optics 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.880
 to recover it then at that moment you 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.440
 can unplug this plug 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.440
 it misses the lights turn to turn 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.560
 it's a quarter turn out direction 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.560
 common 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:26.650
 it is certain if projects but then there the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.289
 block comes easily but for the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.090
 go out the blink goes commission 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.660
 to solidarize it will force you to go 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:39.130
 to annoy us it must be on this side 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.590
 is just inserted in the east with this 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.300
 small tip and against fire he is 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.160
 with a tab that I'm going to 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:52.410
 show on stage I have already dismounted and 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.930
 hung on the block with this language is 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.650
 here so where are the cards and and you 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.320
 push forward 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.520
 it's going to free you our clinics game 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.310
 it's hard to admit when you 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.630
 did you understand you call it on and 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.889
 makes you go out backstage and the finish in 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.889
 drop after that will allow to free 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:26.699
 there will also be the taking of the 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.699
 flashing but there you watch it but 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:36.310
 appreciates the disconnect here I have 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.699
 just picked up the tongue is for 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.220
 show and so now the customer who 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.180
 slip annaba where she removed without 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:57.139
 well rotten problem 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:57.139
 and the optics stand out without difficulty 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:07.220
 a little more trouble on the side 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:11.250
 the same tomorrow it's no problem here 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.850
 so please be careful not 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.250
 to lose is these species of screws in 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.509
 plastic because it allow you 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.030
 to make an adjustment of the optics in 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.430
 the same inclination for those from below 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.919
 for the height like that you said 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.270
 well placed on in relation to your 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:35.250
 caliber alleles talent and that's it 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:40.430
 need adjustment is done first at this 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:43.349
 level before settling with the premium 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.490
 you see it's not very complicated 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.039
 the world can do it if you have 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.650
 need to change your optics 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.479
 do not hesitate to do it yourself I 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.169
 more than to tell you the next is the 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.169
 good changes that this
