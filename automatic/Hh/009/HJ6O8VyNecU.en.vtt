building my computer until let's see

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.190 
building my computer until let's see
about<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.890> month<00:00:58.130> from<00:00:58.280> now<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.120> i<00:00:59.420> will<00:00:59.720> open

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
about a month from now so i will open

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.710 
about a month from now so i will open
the<00:01:00.320> keyboard<00:01:00.530> however<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.059> i<00:01:02.090> guess<00:01:02.360> mostly

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
the keyboard however so i guess mostly

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.450 
the keyboard however so i guess mostly
you're<00:01:02.870> probably<00:01:03.110> going<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.410> quit<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.430> I

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
you're probably going to quit now that I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.780 
you're probably going to quit now that I
said<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.910> but

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.350 

this<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.510> really<00:01:08.780> heavy<00:01:09.520> we<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.700> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this is really heavy we have a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.560 
this is really heavy we have a
oh<00:01:13.130> six<00:01:14.130> hundred<00:01:14.490> some-odd<00:01:14.850> watt<00:01:15.240> power

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
oh six hundred some-odd watt power

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.830 
oh six hundred some-odd watt power
supply<00:01:16.790> save<00:01:17.790> energy<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> maximize

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
supply save energy and maximize

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.430 
supply save energy and maximize
performance<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.730> good

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
performance so it has to be good

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.790 
performance so it has to be good
cooler<00:01:23.040> quieter<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> greener<00:01:24.590> nice<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
cooler quieter and greener nice and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.050 
cooler quieter and greener nice and
silver<00:01:26.160> so

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.410 

look<00:01:29.509> at<00:01:29.659> all<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.780> really<00:01:33.020> heavy

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
look at all that that's really heavy

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.929 
look at all that that's really heavy
next<00:01:35.420> up<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.720> have<00:01:38.619> my<00:01:39.619> one<00:01:40.130> terabyte<00:01:40.670> hard

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
next up we have my one terabyte hard

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.870 
next up we have my one terabyte hard

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.880 

lots<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.490> cleanup<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:27.380> next<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.740> have

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the second of my 57 70s I'm sure most of

the second of my 57 70s I'm sure most of
you<00:02:35.270> will<00:02:35.630> probably<00:02:36.640> go<00:02:37.640> crazy<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.330> I'm

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480

you will probably go crazy then I'm
cross<00:02:38.720> firing<00:02:39.200> because<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.130> bunch<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.430> people

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
cross firing because a bunch of people

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.110 
cross firing because a bunch of people
at<00:02:40.760> my<00:02:40.880> school<00:02:40.910> think<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.870> bad<00:02:42.020> idea<00:02:42.140> but

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
at my school think it's a bad idea but

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.880 
at my school think it's a bad idea but
you<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.270> had<00:02:44.660> some<00:02:44.870> money<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.110> spend<00:02:45.440> so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
you know I had some money to spend so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.300 
you know I had some money to spend so
yeah<00:02:48.890> hopefully<00:02:49.459> get<00:02:49.880> some<00:02:49.910> good<00:02:50.180> results

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
yeah hopefully get some good results

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:04.850 
yeah hopefully get some good results
benchmarks

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.080 

yeah<00:03:05.860> there<00:03:06.070> we<00:03:06.190> go<00:03:06.390> system<00:03:07.390> builder<00:03:07.660> pak<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
yeah there we go system builder pak so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.020 
yeah there we go system builder pak so
that<00:03:10.090> looks<00:03:10.240> like<00:03:10.480> windows<00:03:10.780> seven<00:03:11.140> yes

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that looks like windows seven yes

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.290 
that looks like windows seven yes
doesn't<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.270> come<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.630> nice<00:03:13.780> box<00:03:14.020> but<00:03:15.300> no

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
doesn't really come in a nice box but no

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:27.210 
doesn't really come in a nice box but no
one<00:03:16.420> really<00:03:16.450> cares<00:03:16.870> about<00:03:16.960> boxes<00:03:25.710> see<00:03:26.710> here<00:03:26.950> we

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
one really cares about boxes see here we
