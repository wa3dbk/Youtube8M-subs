was just glorious and it was fun and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.250 
was just glorious and it was fun and
even<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.430> say<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.720> game<00:02:49.020> is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
even here they say that this game is

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.350 
even here they say that this game is
still<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.920> retain<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.489> difficulty<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
still going to retain that difficulty a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.890 
still going to retain that difficulty a
little<00:02:51.989> bit<00:02:52.400> lower<00:02:53.400> down<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.780> still

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
little bit lower down but it's still

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
little bit lower down but it's still
going<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.620> significant<00:02:56.280> amount<00:02:56.519> of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
going to have a significant amount of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.300 
going to have a significant amount of
difficulty<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.959> they've<00:02:58.140> installed<00:02:58.890> things

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
difficulty but they've installed things

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.770 
difficulty but they've installed things
like<00:02:59.820> more<00:03:00.530> hits<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.860> damage<00:03:02.370> points<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.600> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
like more hits and damage points for you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.320 
like more hits and damage points for you
to<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.170> instead<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.489> two<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.150> have

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
to get instead of just two you can have

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.990 
to get instead of just two you can have
three<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.410> each<00:03:07.530> character<00:03:07.920> six<00:03:08.700> hits

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
three for each character six hits

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.470 
three for each character six hits
instead<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.200> standard<00:03:10.650> too<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.850> they

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
instead of just a standard too so they

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.870 
instead of just a standard too so they
install<00:03:12.930> things<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.799> game<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.670> work

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
install things in the game to work

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.870 
install things in the game to work
around<00:03:15.180> some<00:03:16.170> people's<00:03:16.620> frustrations<00:03:17.519> with

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
around some people's frustrations with

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.680 
around some people's frustrations with
the<00:03:18.090> whole<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.100> one<00:03:20.730> hit<00:03:20.940> damage<00:03:21.209> with

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the whole you know one hit damage with

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.530 
the whole you know one hit damage with
the<00:03:21.810> current<00:03:22.049> levels<00:03:22.500> or<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.340> rocket<00:03:24.239> barrel

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the current levels or the rocket barrel

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.259 
the current levels or the rocket barrel
levels<00:03:24.900> now<00:03:25.320> those<00:03:25.830> have<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.820> more<00:03:27.060> hit

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
levels now those have actually more hit

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.030 
levels now those have actually more hit
points<00:03:27.299> now<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.320> hit<00:03:28.530> points<00:03:28.890> with

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
points now you have to hit points with

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.030 
points now you have to hit points with
that<00:03:29.250> if<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.360> get<00:03:30.510> hit<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.680> won't<00:03:31.950> die

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
that if you get hit you won't die

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.940 
that if you get hit you won't die
immediately<00:03:32.640> you'll<00:03:33.269> actually<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:34.410> another

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
immediately you'll actually have another

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.130 
immediately you'll actually have another
chance<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.880> it's<00:03:36.120> still<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.079> be

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
chance so it's still going to be

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.650 
chance so it's still going to be
difficult<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:37.950> fairly<00:03:38.400> easier<00:03:39.000> at<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.269> same

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
difficult but fairly easier at the same

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.880 
difficult but fairly easier at the same
time<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:41.209> yes<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.630> mode<00:03:42.989> will<00:03:43.019> definitely

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
time so yes this mode will definitely

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.009

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
which I believe there are segments where

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.360 
which I believe there are segments where
you<00:05:07.680> will<00:05:07.979> actually<00:05:08.370> be<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.390> Glenn<00:05:10.110> because<00:05:11.040> if

you will actually be on Glenn because if

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.270 
you will actually be on Glenn because if
i<00:05:11.550> recall<00:05:11.760> correctly<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.500> dark<00:05:13.740> own<00:05:14.010> game

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
i recall correctly in this dark own game

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.280 
i recall correctly in this dark own game
you<00:05:14.550> actually<00:05:14.760> have<00:05:15.120> an<00:05:15.300> air<00:05:15.540> supply<00:05:15.780> a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
you actually have an air supply a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.500 
you actually have an air supply a
limited<00:05:16.800> air<00:05:16.979> supply<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:17.820> not<00:05:18.090> unlimited

like the classic doggy
so<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.410> wouldn't<00:05:22.980> say<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.640> wouldn't<00:05:24.000> think<00:05:24.240> that

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
so I wouldn't say I wouldn't think that

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.600 
so I wouldn't say I wouldn't think that
they're<00:05:24.630> all<00:05:24.660> just<00:05:25.230> completely<00:05:25.620> underwater

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
they're all just completely underwater

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.330 
they're all just completely underwater
but<00:05:27.090> underwater<00:05:27.720> themed<00:05:28.200> for<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.710> most<00:05:29.010> part

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
but underwater themed for the most part

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.070 
but underwater themed for the most part
but<00:05:30.180> since<00:05:31.580> unworld<00:05:32.580> for<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.270> all<00:05:33.480> underwater

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
but since unworld for is all underwater

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.860 
but since unworld for is all underwater
up<00:05:34.980> apparently<00:05:35.970> maybe<00:05:36.810> aguar<00:05:37.500> day<00:05:37.680> will<00:05:37.950> be<00:05:38.190> a

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
up apparently maybe aguar day will be a

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.110 
up apparently maybe aguar day will be a
buddy<00:05:39.870> there<00:05:40.410> specifically<00:05:41.340> in<00:05:41.670> guate<00:05:41.940> is

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
buddy there specifically in guate is

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.780 
buddy there specifically in guate is
basically<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.840> water<00:05:43.050> version<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.680> ram<00:05:43.950> be<00:05:44.160> so

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
basically the water version of ram be so

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.720 
basically the water version of ram be so
hopefully<00:05:45.480> they<00:05:45.780> do<00:05:45.840> because<00:05:46.530> if<00:05:47.010> they<00:05:47.430> miss
