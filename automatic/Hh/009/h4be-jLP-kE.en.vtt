00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
you ought his season at home there were

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.470 
you ought his season at home there were
certainly<00:01:54.370> a<00:01:54.460> couple<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.730> noises<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.120> got<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
certainly a couple of noises I got a

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.740 
certainly a couple of noises I got a
feeling<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.930> might<00:01:56.080> have<00:01:56.230> been<00:01:56.350> baton<00:01:56.950> pad

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
feeling it might have been baton pad

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.480 
feeling it might have been baton pad
let's<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.900> look<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.140> super<00:01:59.770> slow-mo<00:02:00.010> past

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
let's have a look at super slow-mo past

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.910 
let's have a look at super slow-mo past
the<00:02:00.930> inside<00:02:01.930> edge<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.260> Michael<00:02:02.500> Slater's<00:02:02.770> map

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
the inside edge of Michael Slater's map

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.590 
the inside edge of Michael Slater's map
on<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.220> his<00:02:03.340> new<00:02:03.490> role<00:02:03.730> and<00:02:03.940> then<00:02:04.240> up<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.510> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
on to his new role and then up in the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.210 
on to his new role and then up in the
air<00:02:04.750> now<00:02:05.020> that's<00:02:05.620> where<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.890> does<00:02:06.040> get

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
air now that's where it does get

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.500 
air now that's where it does get
difficult<00:02:06.370> for<00:02:06.730> umpires<00:02:07.030> because<00:02:07.270> there<00:02:07.390> was

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
difficult for umpires because there was

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.150 
difficult for umpires because there was
certainly<00:02:07.840> two<00:02:08.050> noises<00:02:08.470> there<00:02:08.680> that's<00:02:09.040> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
certainly two noises there that's the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.350 
certainly two noises there that's the
sort<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.399> thing<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.700> I'm<00:02:09.790> pause<00:02:10.030> could<00:02:10.240> get

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
sort of thing that I'm pause could get

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.400 
sort of thing that I'm pause could get
very<00:02:10.510> confused<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:13.200> Wow<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.230> made<00:02:17.380> a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
very confused with Wow that you made a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.440 
very confused with Wow that you made a
decision<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.920> home<00:02:18.070> let's<00:02:18.880> listen<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.270> Toby

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
decision at home let's listen to Toby

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.090 
decision at home let's listen to Toby
now<00:02:19.750> bear<00:02:19.990> in<00:02:20.020> mind<00:02:20.140> he's<00:02:20.530> got<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.770> pitch<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
now bear in mind he's got to pitch this

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.010 
now bear in mind he's got to pitch this
ball<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.520> line<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.000> then<00:02:22.240> straighten<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.840> down

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
ball in line and then straighten it down

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.920 
ball in line and then straighten it down
the<00:02:23.170> line<00:02:23.320> pictures<00:02:24.150> probably<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.480> outside

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the line pictures probably just outside

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.150 
the line pictures probably just outside
off<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.470> don't<00:02:26.680> think<00:02:26.860> it's<00:02:26.950> come<00:02:27.130> back

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
off and I don't think it's come back

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
off and I don't think it's come back
enough<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.540> also<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.930> little<00:02:29.230> bit<00:02:29.350> high

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
enough and it's also a little bit high

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.340 
enough and it's also a little bit high
so<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> batsman<00:02:30.760> probably<00:02:31.210> survives<00:02:31.570> my

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
so the batsman probably survives my

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.620 
so the batsman probably survives my
decision<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.070> out<00:02:33.280> slice<00:02:34.090> has<00:02:34.240> got<00:02:34.390> very

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
decision is not out slice has got very

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.270 
decision is not out slice has got very
short<00:02:34.930> legs<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.290> umpire<00:02:35.620> has<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> very

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
short legs and umpire has to be very

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.070 
short legs and umpire has to be very
aware<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.420> hit<00:02:37.540> flats<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:37.990> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
aware of that you can hit flats on the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.590 
aware of that you can hit flats on the
hip<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.530> still<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.920> stumped<00:02:39.160> hi<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.240> thought

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
hip and it still be stumped hi I thought

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.830 
hip and it still be stumped hi I thought
I'd<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:40.900> away<00:02:41.020> with<00:02:41.350> wearing<00:02:41.530> youth<00:02:41.740> paper

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
I'd get away with wearing youth paper

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.630 
I'd get away with wearing youth paper
where'd<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> ball<00:02:44.050> pitch<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:45.190> he<00:02:45.340> bowling

far<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.500> think<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:15.310> definitely<00:03:15.490> turned<00:03:15.880> back

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
far I think it's definitely turned back

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.910 
far I think it's definitely turned back
enough<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.450> hit<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> stumps<00:03:17.050> but<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.650> may<00:03:17.800> have

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
enough to hit the stumps but it may have

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.360 
enough to hit the stumps but it may have
gone<00:03:18.130> too<00:03:18.430> far<00:03:18.460> to<00:03:19.270> Miss<00:03:19.450> leg<00:03:19.660> stump<00:03:20.370> now

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
gone too far to Miss leg stump now

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.670 
gone too far to Miss leg stump now
that's<00:03:21.610> one<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.850> those<00:03:22.000> real<00:03:22.330> 5050<00:03:23.200> ones<00:03:23.410> where

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
that's one of those real 5050 ones where

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.920 
that's one of those real 5050 ones where
I<00:03:23.950> think<00:03:24.340> umpires<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.150> certainly<00:03:25.540> give<00:03:25.750> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
I think umpires can certainly give that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.510 
I think umpires can certainly give that
out<00:03:25.960> particularly<00:03:26.860> under<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.100> pressure<00:03:27.400> of

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
out particularly under the pressure of

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.630 
out particularly under the pressure of
say<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> day<00:03:28.690> for<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:29.050> day<00:03:29.320> five<00:03:30.100> wicket<00:03:30.460> that's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
say a day for a day five wicket that's

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.600 
say a day for a day five wicket that's
turning<00:03:30.940> I've<00:03:31.720> certainly<00:03:32.050> seen<00:03:32.610> decisions

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
turning I've certainly seen decisions

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.340 
turning I've certainly seen decisions
like<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.880> given<00:03:34.180> out<00:03:34.300> before<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.930> I've<00:03:35.170> also

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
like that given out before and I've also

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.290 
like that given out before and I've also
seen<00:03:35.650> them<00:03:35.800> turned<00:03:36.010> down<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.790> rule<00:03:36.970> 50

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
seen them turned down that's a rule 50

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.780 
seen them turned down that's a rule 50
51<00:03:37.690> let's<00:03:38.290> try<00:03:38.470> something<00:03:38.800> there's<00:03:39.100> been<00:03:39.250> one

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
51 let's try something there's been one

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
51 let's try something there's been one
or<00:03:39.910> two<00:03:39.940> contentious<00:03:40.570> thumpings<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.140> this

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
or two contentious thumpings in this

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.110 
or two contentious thumpings in this
match<00:03:41.470> -<00:03:41.740> let's<00:03:42.280> see<00:03:42.400> if<00:03:42.460> we<00:03:42.580> can<00:03:42.700> get<00:03:42.820> slats

match - let's see if we can get slats

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.150 
match - let's see if we can get slats

definitely<00:04:11.890> our<00:04:12.310> foot<00:04:12.700> was<00:04:12.850> in<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.209> air<00:04:13.330> when

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
definitely our foot was in the air when

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.900 
definitely our foot was in the air when
the<00:04:14.410> bales<00:04:14.650> would<00:04:14.920> have<00:04:15.010> come<00:04:15.190> off<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.520> had<00:04:15.760> we

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the bales would have come off it had we

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.229 
the bales would have come off it had we
had<00:04:16.060> bales

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
had bales

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.879 
had bales
our<00:04:18.750> Michael<00:04:19.139> Slater<00:04:19.319> would<00:04:19.470> definitely<00:04:19.829> be

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
our Michael Slater would definitely be

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.439 
our Michael Slater would definitely be
given<00:04:20.130> out<00:04:20.250> on<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.880> occasion<00:04:21.120> wolf

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
given out on that occasion wolf

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.270 
given out on that occasion wolf
definitely<00:04:22.229> add<00:04:22.380> flats<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:22.949> did<00:04:23.069> it<00:04:23.160> feel

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
definitely add flats but how did it feel

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.890 
definitely add flats but how did it feel
to<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.669> sequence<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.150> bales<00:04:24.389> going<00:04:24.750> off

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
to you the sequence of bales going off

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.600 
to you the sequence of bales going off
and<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.530> your<00:04:25.560> crease<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.039> just<00:04:26.280> felt<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
and you in your crease it just felt that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.129 
and you in your crease it just felt that
I<00:04:26.699> was<00:04:26.789> too<00:04:26.970> slow<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.479> overcommitted<00:04:27.840> I

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
I was too slow and overcommitted I

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.360 
I was too slow and overcommitted I
thought<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:28.440> ball<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.620> going<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:28.949> turn<00:04:29.130> back

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
thought the ball was going to turn back

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.980 
thought the ball was going to turn back
a<00:04:29.400> lot<00:04:29.639> more<00:04:29.789> than<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.090> did<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.569> by<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.840> time

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
a lot more than it did so by the time

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.930 
a lot more than it did so by the time
I'd<00:04:31.259> sort<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.889> over<00:04:32.130> balance<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.699> Phil

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
I'd sort of over balance but like Phil

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.360 
I'd sort of over balance but like Phil
Jake's<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.419> them<00:04:33.539> at<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> MCG<00:04:34.259> but<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.190> tie<00:04:35.340> I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
Jake's and them at the MCG but the tie I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.040 
Jake's and them at the MCG but the tie I
was<00:04:35.669> probably<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> air<00:04:36.389> just<00:04:36.660> maybe

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
was probably in the air just maybe

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.689 
was probably in the air just maybe
hovering<00:04:37.560> over<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.889> line<00:04:38.099> but<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.460> was<00:04:38.490> all

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
hovering over the line but it was all

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.550 
hovering over the line but it was all
too<00:04:38.880> slow<00:04:39.210> getting<00:04:39.569> back<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:39.960> it's<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.500> know

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
too slow getting back and it's you know

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.290 
too slow getting back and it's you know
it's<00:04:40.740> marginal<00:04:41.160> for<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.340> batsman<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:42.270> the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
it's marginal for a batsman and the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.909 
it's marginal for a batsman and the
umpire<00:04:42.630> doesn't<00:04:42.810> have<00:04:42.960> much<00:04:43.110> time<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.590> think

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
umpire doesn't have much time I think

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.320 
umpire doesn't have much time I think
luckily<00:04:44.340> they<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.639> go<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:44.940> third<00:04:45.120> on
