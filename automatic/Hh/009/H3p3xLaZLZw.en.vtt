00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.310
 and vanilla sponge cake 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.130
 ingredients 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.900
 implements to use for this 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.309
 preparation we will use large eggs 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.240
 as we have taken them out of the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.420
 refrigerator are cold so 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.400
 that we will place them in warm water until 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.400
 reach room temperature 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.220
 When they are ready, we dry them and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.670
 we started preparing to use 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.190
 eggs at room temperature is key 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 to achieve a greater volume in the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670
 smoothie 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.790
 Moss butter and flour the mos 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.120
 mold to prevent the biscuit from 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.120
 stick 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 the oven must maintain a temperature 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.080
 constant therefore we preheat and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 we do the cooking to it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.940
 temperature 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.180
 in a bowl we deposit the eggs 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.240
 we add the sugar we deposit the salt 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.350
 and we beat at maximum speed until 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.350
 reach volume 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 the shake is another relevant aspect in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 this process in a few minutes does not 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 will reach a good volume I should have beat 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 for 12 minutes 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.289
 when dropping the shake this is 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.759
 holds over the mix that is not 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.390
 melt means you're ready 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.390
 add the vanilla 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.569
 and we beat again to integrate 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.359
 i 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.300
 we will continue only with spatula 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.710
 we make the flour and perform 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.940
 enveloping movements for 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.020
 incorporate it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.330
 this movement must be done 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.540
 gently and from the center towards 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.540
 outside 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.500
 we add the flour of 2 tablespoons 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.570
 in 2 tablespoons to prevent them from being made 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 lumps or that the shake is lowered 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.310
 Once the shake is finished, we deposit it in the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.000
 mold and we give small taps to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.240
 remove bubbles 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.900
 We take to the oven previously 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.840
 preheated 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.099
 with a skewer we click to check 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.290
 the cooking if it comes out wet is still missing and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.290
 if it comes out dry it's ready 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.340
 remove from the oven and let cool 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.370
 so that you have it in mind during the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.850
 cooking the cake takes off its 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.069
 edges when you're ready 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.439
 Y 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.040
 only when the cake is 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.920
 good cold we take it off the mold and 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.790
 then we take it apart 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.330
 I use this cake for 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.840
 a cake of three milks however 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.480
 so you can see how it is fluffy 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.800
 I show a piece of a sponge cake that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.800
 I had prepared 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:34.400
 There are two types of cookies the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.160
 heavy and light or light 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.930
 preparation corresponds a sponge cake 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.830
 light because it only includes flour 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.770
 eggs and sugar 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.630
 It is characterized by being very light 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:55.040
 soft and fluffy weight unlike 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.820
 heavy cake that also contains 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.750
 margarine milk and baking powder reason 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.800
 whereby it is of stable consistency and 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.800
 of vision its flavor 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.710
 I have included these images for 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.220
 show that there is no difference in this 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.730
 type of cake between one that contains 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.850
 baking powder and other powder-free 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.850
 to bake 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.610
 Here I show how is this same 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.480
 cake after applying the filling and 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.480
 its decoration 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.510
