 uribe was calando in the imaginary of colombia 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.239
 your conviction in security

 his stick 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.439
 your responsible economic management 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.869
 your model of citizen cooperation 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.499
 his closeness to his constituents and the community councils were 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.679
 determinants 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.829
 simple but irreverent 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.699
 obsessed by the figures and the results sensitive but explosive 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.339
 amid the difficulties of a country with high rates of violence 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.249
 corruption and social backwardness his personality came out afloat 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.550
 the pair 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.660
 the terrorists get used to seeing liars 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 the 68 people and with a problem 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.990
 when I say no 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.910
 when min the midwives who attended to my mother the nurses 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.460
 they offered him the little boy that I was 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 they passed it to my father also took off the pine nut xinzo de limia 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.000
 I ask God that I 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 helps control this temperament 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.170
 that help me aquila 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 world position of prudence 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.560
 a different and better elegant 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.510
 I think a lot about injuries 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.170
 the meat 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.650
 in this regard from firefighters of the three of the road stroke unit 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.680
 I had thought 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.890
 towards half past four without a decision made so far 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.520
 consult all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.140
 and of all men 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 does not make the decision 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.730
 ask the series 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
 There will also be activity by necessity 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.560
 and around bonasso criticisms that make you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.980
 when everything seemed impossible 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.170
 the marker although in general 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 the second half sentenced 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 one that has been maintained for 22 hours 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 with the arrival 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.950
 as she defines it, her husband does not have a reverse 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 as he describes himself he is a man convinced that energy does not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.959
 they sell it in the pharmacies I saw that you can always advance one more villa 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.039
 or get 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.379
 one more vote 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.569
 go to the joke counter 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.749
 sum to the country of the crisis 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.839
 not just as a singer 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.799
 all of that is a copy circumstances that have to be very boring 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.639
 we are human beings 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.019
 a carnitas and some stalls used to say of himself uribe 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.690
 in 2004 his caucus in the congress 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.170
 estimated that four years were insufficient to consolidate their 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.689
 policies 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.699
 and on the pretext that the spa 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.909
 they could not recover political and military oxygen 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.829
 reformed the constitution 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.089
 and approved immediate reelection 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:56.419
 in May 2006 as a reward for his good performance by 62% of the votes the 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.449
 highest vote in the history of Colombia until then 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.699
 Álvaro Uribe was elected for a new four-year term 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.319
 the society ratified 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.639
 that his dedication and leadership should have a new opportunity 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.179
 the only governments that serve are those that come campaign 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.719
 because the campaign and everything follows now a great commitment with the citizens 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.809
 but the power wears and as the blows against the guerrillas came 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:29.239
 also the scandal came the nexus between the political class and the 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.239
 paramilitarism fas known as parapolítica 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.589
 the parapolitics 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.669
 where does it come from 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.959
 the crimes are prior to my government 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.639
 Although a trial has not been made 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.729
 because the country took the derby of paramilitaries 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.729
 it's the country that I found 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.789
 in many regions of Colombia to do politics 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.089
 1s been in some cases to ask permission to narcoterrorism in other cases 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 to the narco-guerrilla in other cases to narcoparamilitarismo 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.379
 and that which recovers from his government 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.909
 the freedom to do politics 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.849
 In mid-2007 a group of followers of President Uribe began 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.450
 to collect signatures to promote a referendum that would allow him to continue 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.379
 in the presidency for a third term 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.579
 he was backed by his government actions and his blows to the farc 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.910
 that later achieved a success of international repercussion with the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.330
 Checking operation 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.120
 in July 2008 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.950
 when without a shot the military rescued 15 kidnapped 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.910
 among them the former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.460
 however in February 2010 the constitutional court declared invalid the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.680
 referendo the third term 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.169
 for errors in its procedure in the congress 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.130
 I agree 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.930
 my respect 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.460
 the sentence of the honorable constitutional court by which he declares 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.669
 inexequible 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.490
 the law that called for a presidential reelection referendum 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.669
 with its colloquial language that defines itself as 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.849
 a civilian in a tie with a soldier's soul 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.300
 uribe talks about his inheritance as three pueblitos por conser 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.809
 democratic security investor confidence and social cohesion 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:22.459
 a heritage that results in having cornered the FARC that in 2002 already 

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.069
 it showed to the cities 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.999
 sustained economic growth a flow of seasonal capital and 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.029
 foreigners in a country that had lost credibility and a society 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.789
 in close contact with his ruler who regained confidence in his 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.279
 authorities 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.899
 his friends and analysts agree that he has a sin in Colombia 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.990
 a country that rises 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.580
 a country that regains its dignity 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.949
 Alvaro Uribe 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.840
 of the dress distances from a state of indiana ingolstadt 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.379
 a recent study also aims to show 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.210
 you can not play security did not work peace 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.189
 that ability to say that the assembly of the people 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.849
 inditex indicated that indeed the undisclosed is not simple people 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.689
 at the end of the oea presidency 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.069
 I'm going to catch up with him 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.249
 in some 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.979
 financial mathematics 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.900
 silvia margarita armchair on the council 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.229
 and there they continue 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.740
 try it later 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.439
 Wagons abound using reason 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.729
 aware 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.659
 and with a good body 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.180
 many more years and there came 25 years is going to fall off the horse what 

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.179
 catch force of the current currency 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.610
 álvaro uribe vélez 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.099
 a leader as controversial as charismatic 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.479
 with the overflowing energy of his father and the civic passion of his mother 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.370
 genius and figure of his aunts sport horses 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.880
 or student leader 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.760
 until his works as ruler 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.159
 of your province and of colombia 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.410
 with 80% popularity when leaving the government 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.460
 which is explained by his achievements 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.249
 and because 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.059
 unlike their predecessors 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.669
 finally this philosopher with no one that good governments 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:13.669
 are those who live in campaign left the presidential palace 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.449
 and he let people steal 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.660
 his influence will be maintained for many years 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.539
 the current tour history 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.020
 at least in security from the legacy of the severe farc even at the expense of 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.020
 diplomatic relations with the government of hugo chávez in venezuela 

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:31.619
 hard with his detractors of the former defender of his work 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.710
 if we are not retired from public life 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.539
 for now he persists in his report 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.029
 Work work
