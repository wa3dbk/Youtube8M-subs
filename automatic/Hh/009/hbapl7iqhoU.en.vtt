seemed that the women had very bright
under<00:02:25.870> eye<00:02:25.900> area<00:02:26.470> specifically<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
under eye area specifically the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.670 
under eye area specifically the
waterline<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.750> going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.990> use<00:02:29.260> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
waterline so I'm going to use a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.700 
waterline so I'm going to use a
nude-colored<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.850> pencil<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
nude-colored I pencil and do the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.809 
nude-colored I pencil and do the
waterline

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.239 

this<00:02:41.420> just<00:02:41.629> gives<00:02:41.810> kind<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.349> more<00:02:42.590> energized

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:43.249 
this just gives kind of a more energized

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:51.220 
this just gives kind of a more energized
appearance

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.780
