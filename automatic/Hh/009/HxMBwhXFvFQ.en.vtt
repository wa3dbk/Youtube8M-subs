00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
series I show you how to survive when

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.390 
series I show you how to survive when
you're<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.710> starting<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.190> different

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
you're just starting out in different

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.029 
you're just starting out in different
biomes<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.960> thought<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> would<00:00:19.380> kick<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
biomes and I thought I would kick the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.920 
biomes and I thought I would kick the
series<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> simplest<00:00:21.359> biome<00:00:21.720> ever

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
series off with the simplest biome ever

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.019 
series off with the simplest biome ever
it's<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> forest<00:00:22.740> biome<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.699> probably<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's the forest biome it's probably the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
it's the forest biome it's probably the
most<00:00:24.150> basic<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.900> all<00:00:25.140> biomes<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.740> have

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
most basic of all biomes you have

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
most basic of all biomes you have
resources<00:00:26.310> everywhere<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.029> trees<00:00:27.390> for

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
resources everywhere you got trees for

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
resources everywhere you got trees for
wood<00:00:27.779> planks<00:00:28.349> yet<00:00:29.250> ponds<00:00:29.730> everywhere<00:00:30.269> maybe<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
wood planks yet ponds everywhere maybe a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.430 
wood planks yet ponds everywhere maybe a
river<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.679> lake<00:00:31.730> he<00:00:32.730> has<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:33.030> lava<00:00:33.440> every

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
river or lake he has some lava every

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860 
river or lake he has some lava every
once<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.770> while<00:00:34.969> there's<00:00:35.969> caves<00:00:36.239> their

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
once in a while there's caves their

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560 
once in a while there's caves their
surface<00:00:37.290> caves<00:00:37.530> mostly<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.210> see<00:00:39.360> here

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
surface caves mostly so as you see here

i am just spawning i'm going to go over
to<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.480> tree<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.809> cut<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> down<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
to this tree and cut it down because I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
to this tree and cut it down because I
need<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> wood<00:00:44.160> planks<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.910> make<00:00:45.059> pretty<00:00:45.660> much

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
need the wood planks to make pretty much

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
need the wood planks to make pretty much
everything<00:00:46.289> would<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.950> used<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.489> make

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
everything would can be used to make

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.819 
everything would can be used to make
your<00:00:48.360> house<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.110> tools<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> can

there's<00:01:19.619> lava<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.460> below<00:01:20.759> me<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.659> not

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
there's lava right below me which is not

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.280 
there's lava right below me which is not
good<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.759> one<00:01:23.759> trick<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.509> holding<00:01:25.049> shift

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
good and one trick is I'm holding shift

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
good and one trick is I'm holding shift
right<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.340> oil<00:01:26.520> fall<00:01:26.759> but

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
right here just now an oil fall but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
right here just now an oil fall but
sometimes<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.869> slip<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> fall<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.710> debt

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
sometimes you slip and fall your debt

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.800 
sometimes you slip and fall your debt
and<00:01:29.130> land<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> creeper<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.880> dot<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and land on a creeper and dot just like

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.440 
and land on a creeper and dot just like
that<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> no<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> come<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that so no time is going to come and you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.609 
that so no time is going to come and you
always<00:01:33.570> got<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.900> prepared<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
always got to be prepared for that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
always got to be prepared for that
because<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.280> hostile<00:01:35.640> mobs<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> monsters

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
because the hostile mobs and monsters

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
because the hostile mobs and monsters
are<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> try<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> kill<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
are going to try to kill you which you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
are going to try to kill you which you
don't<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
don't want so you're going to want to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
don't want so you're going to want to
make<00:01:40.110> armor<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.890> am<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
make armor like I am here and this is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
make armor like I am here and this is
leather<00:01:43.200> armor<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.740> probably<00:01:44.040> most<00:01:44.759> basic

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
leather armor it's probably most basic

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
leather armor it's probably most basic
ever<00:01:45.810> doesn't<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.560> protect<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
ever doesn't really protect you that
