as<00:00:15.220> you<00:00:15.400> get<00:00:15.580> toward<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.299> inboard<00:00:16.869> windings

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
as you get toward the inboard windings

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.740 
as you get toward the inboard windings
there<00:00:17.740> may<00:00:17.950> not<00:00:18.190> be<00:00:18.400> enough<00:00:18.700> room<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.390> get<00:00:19.510> that

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
there may not be enough room to get that

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.990 
there may not be enough room to get that
wire<00:00:20.050> through<00:00:20.410> so<00:00:20.770> use<00:00:20.980> your<00:00:21.160> old<00:00:21.310> propeller

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
wire through so use your old propeller

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.640 
wire through so use your old propeller
and<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.830> if<00:00:23.950> you<00:00:24.070> can<00:00:24.420> make<00:00:25.420> room<00:00:25.660> for<00:00:25.720> it<00:00:26.170> and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
and see if you can make room for it and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.029 
and see if you can make room for it and
if<00:00:27.280> that<00:00:27.460> doesn't<00:00:27.789> do<00:00:28.060> it<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:29.470> might<00:00:29.650> be<00:00:29.860> able

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
if that doesn't do it you might be able

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.519 
if that doesn't do it you might be able
to<00:00:30.130> take<00:00:30.369> your<00:00:30.820> needle<00:00:31.210> that<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.750> home<00:00:32.110> your

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
to take your needle that you home your

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.450 
to take your needle that you home your
EPP<00:00:33.250> foam<00:00:33.520> down<00:00:33.820> with<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.360> maybe<00:00:34.570> find<00:00:35.020> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
EPP foam down with and maybe find a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.939 
EPP foam down with and maybe find a
little<00:00:36.460> hole<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:36.760> there<00:00:37.330> with<00:00:37.600> that<00:00:37.780> but<00:00:38.230> be

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
little hole in there with that but be

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.190 
little hole in there with that but be
careful<00:00:39.430> not<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:41.640> wear<00:00:42.640> away<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
careful not to wear away the the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.979 
careful not to wear away the the
insulation<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.220> as<00:00:46.059> you<00:00:46.180> get<00:00:46.329> toward<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.720> end

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
insulation and as you get toward the end

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.440 
insulation and as you get toward the end
you<00:00:47.320> may<00:00:47.500> find<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:48.130> you'll<00:00:48.340> have<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.610> fish

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
you may find that you'll have to fish

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
you may find that you'll have to fish
the<00:00:49.750> wire<00:00:49.899> through<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.500> hole<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:51.070> you<00:00:51.340> made

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the wire through the hole that you made

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.750 
the wire through the hole that you made
with<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.630> needle<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.230> get<00:00:53.380> that<00:00:53.649> last<00:00:53.920> winding

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
with a needle to get that last winding

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
with a needle to get that last winding
in<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.469> there<00:00:56.770> we<00:00:56.950> go

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
in so there we go

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.610 
in so there we go
this<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.860> man's<00:01:00.420> idea<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.600> sewing<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.350> guess

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
this is a man's idea of sewing I guess

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.980 
this is a man's idea of sewing I guess
oh<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.989> we<00:01:05.259> go<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:05.860> that's<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.250> last<00:01:06.460> one<00:01:06.990> on

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
oh there we go so that's the last one on

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.010 
oh there we go so that's the last one on
that<00:01:08.289> pole<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.860> I've<00:01:11.979> got<00:01:12.220> phase<00:01:12.580> B<00:01:13.090> all<00:01:13.539> done

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
that pole okay I've got phase B all done

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.740 
that pole okay I've got phase B all done
as<00:01:14.289> you<00:01:14.410> can<00:01:14.440> see<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.310> so<00:01:15.970> I<00:01:16.000> only<00:01:16.149> have<00:01:16.420> four

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
as you can see and so I only have four

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.010 
as you can see and so I only have four
poles<00:01:17.170> left<00:01:17.679> and<00:01:18.610> I've<00:01:19.149> got<00:01:19.300> quite<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.569> jumble

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
poles left and I've got quite a jumble

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.160 
poles left and I've got quite a jumble
of<00:01:20.080> wires<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> back<00:01:21.069> of<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> motor<00:01:22.170> but

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
of wires on the back of the motor but

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.960 
of wires on the back of the motor but
that<00:01:23.410> will<00:01:23.560> all<00:01:23.619> get<00:01:23.860> straightened<00:01:24.250> out<00:01:24.459> here

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
that will all get straightened out here

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.990 
that will all get straightened out here
shortly<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:28.390> gonna<00:01:28.569> start<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.729> one

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
shortly so we're gonna start this one

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.370 
shortly so we're gonna start this one
there's<00:01:31.209> going<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.390> be<00:01:31.539> the<00:01:31.660> toughest<00:01:32.080> twine

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
there's going to be the toughest twine

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.430 
there's going to be the toughest twine
so<00:01:32.830> we're<00:01:33.009> gonna<00:01:33.160> take<00:01:33.610> our<00:01:33.849> prop<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.690> we're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
so we're gonna take our prop and we're

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.540 
so we're gonna take our prop and we're
going<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.649> go<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:35.979> each<00:01:36.190> side<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.240> open

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
going to go on each side of the open

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.059 
going to go on each side of the open
phase<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:40.209> try<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.780> bend<00:01:41.140> those<00:01:41.319> copper<00:01:41.830> wires

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
phase and try to bend those copper wires

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.870 
phase and try to bend those copper wires
that<00:01:42.640> are<00:01:42.789> next<00:01:43.179> door<00:01:44.039> as<00:01:45.039> tight<00:01:45.369> as<00:01:45.520> we<00:01:45.700> can

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
that are next door as tight as we can

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.760 
that are next door as tight as we can
get<00:01:46.119> them<00:01:46.270> against<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:48.810> Pole<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.259> that's

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
get them against their Pole and that's

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.630 
get them against their Pole and that's
going<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.130> give<00:01:51.280> us<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.700> little<00:01:52.599> more<00:01:53.640> chance

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
going to give us a little more chance

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.410 
going to give us a little more chance
again<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.209> last<00:01:55.479> line<00:01:56.020> done<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:57.550> we're<00:01:58.390> just

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
again this last line done so we're just

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.979 
again this last line done so we're just
gonna<00:01:58.720> work<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.440> in<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.800> that<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.989> hopefully

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
gonna work it in like that and hopefully

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.330 
gonna work it in like that and hopefully
we<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.190> get<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:07.000> last<00:02:07.300> whines<00:02:08.080> on<00:02:08.679> on<00:02:09.099> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
we can get the last whines on on that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.120 
we can get the last whines on on that
phase<00:02:10.119> see<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:12.130> we're<00:02:12.280> gonna<00:02:12.400> start<00:02:14.130> we're

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
phase see so we're gonna start we're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
phase see so we're gonna start we're
gonna<00:02:15.280> start<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> little<00:02:16.090> C<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.660> I've

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
gonna start with the little C that I've

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.119 
gonna start with the little C that I've
marked<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.520> end<00:02:18.670> here<00:02:19.379> which<00:02:20.379> happens<00:02:20.739> to

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
marked on the end here which happens to

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.550 
marked on the end here which happens to
be<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:21.879> here<00:02:22.450> don't<00:02:22.780> know<00:02:22.959> if<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.379> see

him<00:03:17.640> laid<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:18.090> there<00:03:18.299> pretty<00:03:18.900> neat<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:19.769> all

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
him laid in there pretty neat we got all

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.930 
him laid in there pretty neat we got all
the<00:03:20.159> turns<00:03:21.019> we<00:03:22.019> wanted<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.909> a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the turns we wanted to get it was a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.630 
the turns we wanted to get it was a
tight<00:03:24.269> fit<00:03:24.299> though<00:03:24.799> now<00:03:25.799> if<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.099> notice<00:03:26.430> we

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
tight fit though now if you notice we

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.580 
tight fit though now if you notice we
left<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:27.060> long<00:03:27.299> leads<00:03:27.750> those<00:03:28.260> were<00:03:28.379> going<00:03:28.530> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
left the long leads those were going to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.740 
left the long leads those were going to
be<00:03:28.709> our<00:03:28.860> motor<00:03:29.099> leads<00:03:29.370> those<00:03:29.879> were<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.510> end

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
be our motor leads those were at the end

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.589 
be our motor leads those were at the end
that<00:03:31.440> was<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.769> last<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.580> end<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.000> wire<00:03:33.209> on

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
that was the last the end of the wire on

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.500 
that was the last the end of the wire on
each<00:03:33.629> business<00:03:34.080> short<00:03:34.950> ones<00:03:35.160> are<00:03:35.819> gonna<00:03:36.269> be

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
each business short ones are gonna be

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.240 
each business short ones are gonna be
all<00:03:36.660> connected<00:03:37.230> together<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:39.980> form<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
all connected together to form the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.420 
all connected together to form the
common<00:03:41.670> point<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.110> y<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:44.280> we're

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
common point of the of the y so we're

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.619 
common point of the of the y so we're
just<00:03:44.459> gonna<00:03:44.700> simply<00:03:45.000> take<00:03:45.329> some<00:03:46.340> sandpaper

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
just gonna simply take some sandpaper

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:56.199 
just gonna simply take some sandpaper
we're<00:03:48.629> gonna<00:03:48.810> see<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.140> we<00:03:49.290> can't<00:03:49.560> get<00:03:50.959> the

that we don't have any rubbing we look

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.060 
that we don't have any rubbing we look
at<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.060> front<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.539> motor<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.919> looks

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
at the front of the motor and it looks

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.730 
at the front of the motor and it looks
like<00:04:59.250> nothing's<00:04:59.729> rubbing<00:05:00.180> there<00:05:00.530> so<00:05:01.530> we're

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
like nothing's rubbing there so we're

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.710 
like nothing's rubbing there so we're
good<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.460> we're<00:05:02.639> gonna<00:05:02.760> put<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.300> rest<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.630> the
