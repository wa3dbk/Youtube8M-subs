to<00:00:11.550> make<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> traditional<00:00:12.420> origami<00:00:12.719> Bowl<00:00:13.200> you

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
to make the traditional origami Bowl you

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
to make the traditional origami Bowl you
will<00:00:13.650> need<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:14.099> sheet<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> paper<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
will need one sheet of paper that is a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960 
will need one sheet of paper that is a
one<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.049> two<00:00:16.230> ratio<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.640> accomplish

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
one to two ratio so you can accomplish

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.450 
one to two ratio so you can accomplish
this<00:00:18.359> by<00:00:18.420> folding<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.529> square<00:00:19.920> sheet<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> paper

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this by folding a square sheet of paper

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.939 
this by folding a square sheet of paper
in<00:00:20.730> half<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.320> step<00:00:22.500> you're<00:00:22.769> going

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
in half so the first step you're going

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.170 
in half so the first step you're going
to<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.840> you're<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.320> fold<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to do is you're going to fold the one to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960 
to do is you're going to fold the one to
two<00:00:27.359> ratio<00:00:27.599> paper<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.710> half<00:00:29.279> lengthwise<00:00:29.910> like

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
two ratio paper and half lengthwise like

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.130 
two ratio paper and half lengthwise like
this<00:00:32.210> once<00:00:33.210> you've<00:00:33.390> done<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.930> going

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this once you've done that you're going

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.459 
this once you've done that you're going
to<00:00:34.230> unfold<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.450> then<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> bottom

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to unfold and then take the bottom

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
to unfold and then take the bottom
right-hand<00:00:37.710> corner<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.670> fold<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.420> diagonally

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
right-hand corner and fold it diagonally

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.830 
right-hand corner and fold it diagonally
to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.559> horizontal<00:00:41.430> center<00:00:42.300> crease<00:00:42.570> like

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to the horizontal center crease like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
to the horizontal center crease like
this<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.000> ahead<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.450> repeat<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> same

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this then go ahead and repeat the same

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.090 
this then go ahead and repeat the same
thing<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> left<00:00:49.980> side

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.799 

then<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.820> want<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.059> rotate<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.600> sheet<00:00:56.780> of

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
then you want to rotate the sheet of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.840 
then you want to rotate the sheet of
paper<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.500> repeat<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.010> same<00:00:58.340> thing<00:00:58.609> on<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
paper and repeat the same thing on the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:13.010 
paper and repeat the same thing on the
other<00:00:58.879> side

open up the unit like this now you

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.120 
open up the unit like this now you
notice<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.770> there<00:02:22.340> are<00:02:22.390> two<00:02:23.390> triangles<00:02:24.130> one

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
notice that there are two triangles one

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.970 
notice that there are two triangles one
here<00:02:25.489> at<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> top<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.239> one<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.319> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
here at the top and one here at the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.690 
here at the top and one here at the
bottom<00:02:29.080> using<00:02:30.080> these<00:02:30.410> creases<00:02:30.800> we're<00:02:31.370> going

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
bottom using these creases we're going

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.350 
bottom using these creases we're going
to<00:02:31.940> hold<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.980> unit<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.360> vertically

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
to hold the unit like this vertically

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.220 
to hold the unit like this vertically
and<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:37.190> we're<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.790> push<00:02:38.230> inwards

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
and then we're going to push inwards

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
and then we're going to push inwards
along<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.160> folds<00:02:40.790> from<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.819> push

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
along these folds from the side so push

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.199 
along these folds from the side so push
in<00:02:44.269> like<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.610> repeat<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.640> same<00:02:46.970> thing

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
in like that and repeat the same thing

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.949 
in like that and repeat the same thing
on<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.450> left<00:02:47.600> side<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:52.690> once<00:02:53.690> you've<00:02:53.840> done

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
on the left side and once you've done

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.770 
on the left side and once you've done
that<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.799> can<00:02:54.980> easily<00:02:55.310> flatten<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.540> this

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
that you can easily flatten it like this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.140 
that you can easily flatten it like this
and<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:01.040> from<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> top<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.819> should<00:03:01.970> look<00:03:02.090> like

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
and so from the top it should look like

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.759 
and so from the top it should look like
this<00:03:03.519> like<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.840> from<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.260> bottom<00:03:06.380> it

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
this like that and from the bottom it

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.890 
this like that and from the bottom it
should<00:03:06.890> look<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.069> this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.020 

once<00:03:11.560> you've<00:03:11.739> done<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.370> want<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.670> fold

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
once you've done that you want to fold

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.869 
once you've done that you want to fold
the<00:03:13.599> bottom<00:03:13.780> side<00:03:14.439> up<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> point<00:03:17.260> where

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
the bottom side up up to the point where

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:28.640 
the bottom side up up to the point where
this<00:03:18.879> triangle<00:03:19.780> ends<00:03:22.500> fold<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.739> like<00:03:23.829> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.540 

like<00:03:29.650> this

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
like this

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.700 
like this
and<00:03:31.850> then<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.810> want<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.080> repeat<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.500> same

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
and then you want to repeat the same

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.130 
and then you want to repeat the same
thing<00:03:33.980> on<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.190> other<00:03:34.220> side<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:35.060> fold<00:03:35.960> this

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
thing on the other side so fold this

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.700 

once<00:04:25.570> you've<00:04:25.750> done<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:25.960> we're<00:04:26.350> going<00:04:26.500> to

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
once you've done that we're going to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.680 
once you've done that we're going to
turn<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.070> unit<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:27.970> side<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.270> facing

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
turn to unit so that this side is facing

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.890 
turn to unit so that this side is facing
towards<00:04:29.290> us<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.600> bottom<00:04:31.600> should<00:04:31.750> look

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
towards us and the bottom should look

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.040 
towards us and the bottom should look
like<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:33.300> then<00:04:34.300> we're<00:04:34.480> going<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.720> gently

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
like this and then we're going to gently

pull the two flaps in opposite direction
to<00:04:39.150> inflate<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.420> center<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.640> this<00:04:43.350> now

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
to inflate the center just like this now

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.890 
to inflate the center just like this now
you<00:04:44.410> can<00:04:44.680> keep<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:45.070> poufy<00:04:45.520> or<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.510> flatten

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you can keep it poufy or you can flatten

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.650 
you can keep it poufy or you can flatten
it<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.980> make<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.490> D<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:51.120> then<00:04:52.120> you<00:04:52.300> can<00:04:52.450> also

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
it to make it to D and then you can also

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.520 
it to make it to D and then you can also
shape<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:54.120> sharp<00:04:55.120> points<00:04:55.630> over<00:04:56.050> here<00:04:56.380> and

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
shape the sharp points over here and

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.090 
shape the sharp points over here and
over<00:04:57.250> here<00:04:58.020> by<00:04:59.020> folding<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.620> backwards<00:05:02.100> like

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
over here by folding it backwards like

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.470 
over here by folding it backwards like
that

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480
