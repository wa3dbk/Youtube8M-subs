00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
will then have to make sure that the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
will then have to make sure that the
paint<00:02:05.729> has<00:02:05.880> dried<00:02:05.970> or<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> food<00:02:06.810> coloring<00:02:07.049> has

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
paint has dried or the food coloring has

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.999 
paint has dried or the food coloring has
dried<00:02:07.979> before<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.489> stick<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:08.939> onto<00:02:09.299> anything

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
I'm gonna use a pin and you don't want

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.160 
I'm gonna use a pin and you don't want
to<00:03:27.980> directly<00:03:28.640> pop<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> pin<00:03:29.480> into<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.870> cake

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
to directly pop a pin into the cake

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.060 
to directly pop a pin into the cake
itself<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:32.540> kick<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.290> sat<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.740> kick

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
itself but this kick is sat on a kick

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.340 
itself but this kick is sat on a kick
drum<00:03:34.370> so<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.640> cake<00:03:34.850> drum<00:03:35.150> comes<00:03:35.810> probably

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
drum so the cake drum comes probably

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.070 
drum so the cake drum comes probably
about<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> centimeter<00:03:37.550> over<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.330> cake<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.930> as

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
about a centimeter over the cake so as

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.510 
about a centimeter over the cake so as
long<00:03:39.170> as<00:03:39.290> you're<00:03:39.440> putting<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.740> pin<00:03:39.980> with<00:03:40.430> in

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
long as you're putting the pin with in

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.190 
long as you're putting the pin with in
that<00:03:40.640> bottom<00:03:40.970> centimeter<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.750> will<00:03:41.900> go<00:03:42.020> into

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
that bottom centimeter it will go into

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.930 
that bottom centimeter it will go into
your<00:03:42.350> cake<00:03:42.620> board<00:03:42.800> rather<00:03:43.100> than<00:03:43.310> empty<00:03:43.640> cake

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
your cake board rather than empty cake

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.030 
your cake board rather than empty cake
so<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.360> make<00:03:44.540> sure<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:45.170> what<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:45.860> do

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
so just make sure that is what you do

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.600 
so just make sure that is what you do
now<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.209> think<00:03:47.600> I'm<00:03:47.930> going<00:03:48.050> to<00:03:48.110> offset<00:03:48.430> my<00:03:49.430> bow

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
now I think I'm going to offset my bow

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.710 
now I think I'm going to offset my bow
to<00:03:49.880> one<00:03:49.910> side<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.900> cake<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:52.640> I'll<00:03:53.269> overlap

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
to one side of the cake so I'll overlap

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.150 
to one side of the cake so I'll overlap
it<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:55.670> up<00:03:55.910> here<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.560> I'm<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.830> gonna<00:03:57.920> leave

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
it just up here and I'm just gonna leave

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.229 
it just up here and I'm just gonna leave
it<00:03:58.250> like<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.430> for<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.760> time<00:03:58.910> being<00:03:58.970> without

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
it like that for the time being without

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.960 
it like that for the time being without
pin<00:03:59.630> just<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.290> start<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:00.739> now<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.489> can<00:04:01.760> also

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
pin just to start with now you can also

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.690 
pin just to start with now you can also
use<00:04:02.200> royal<00:04:03.200> icing<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.709> stick<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:04.160> which<00:04:04.430> works

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
use royal icing to stick it which works

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.920 
use royal icing to stick it which works
just<00:04:04.820> as<00:04:05.120> well<00:04:05.150> then<00:04:05.450> you'd<00:04:05.570> have<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.750> worry

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
just as well then you'd have to worry

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.540 
just as well then you'd have to worry
about<00:04:05.989> putting<00:04:06.260> anything<00:04:06.500> into<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.980> cake<00:04:07.190> if

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
about putting anything into the cake if

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.979 
about putting anything into the cake if
you've<00:04:07.760> got<00:04:08.000> like<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.180> thinner<00:04:08.480> board<00:04:08.750> at<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
you've got like a thinner board at the

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.229 
you've got like a thinner board at the
bottom<00:04:09.350> rather<00:04:09.980> than<00:04:10.190> using<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.700> think<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:11.030> cake

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
bottom rather than using I think a cake

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.479 
bottom rather than using I think a cake
drum<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:11.690> what<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> have<00:04:12.200> done<00:04:12.380> I've<00:04:13.100> not<00:04:13.370> got

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
drum like what I have done I've not got

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.680 
drum like what I have done I've not got
any<00:04:13.610> royal<00:04:13.760> icing<00:04:13.940> made<00:04:14.209> up<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:14.480> that's<00:04:14.540> why

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
any royal icing made up so that's why

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.850 
any royal icing made up so that's why
I've<00:04:14.810> gotten<00:04:15.019> for<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.170> pin<00:04:15.350> option<00:04:15.680> this<00:04:15.800> time

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
I've gotten for the pin option this time

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.130 
I've gotten for the pin option this time
so<00:04:16.760> what<00:04:16.940> we're<00:04:17.030> going<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> do<00:04:17.330> now<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.810> take<00:04:17.959> in

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
so what we're going to do now is take in

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.070 
so what we're going to do now is take in
another<00:04:18.440> length<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.980> ribbon<00:04:19.840> I'm<00:04:20.840> going<00:04:21.019> to

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
another length of ribbon I'm going to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.130 
another length of ribbon I'm going to
loop<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:21.470> over<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:23.419> again<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.930> I'm<00:04:23.990> just

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
loop it over and again and I'm just

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.360 
loop it over and again and I'm just
gonna<00:04:24.290> see<00:04:24.790> how<00:04:25.790> big<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.390> comparison<00:04:26.780> to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
gonna see how big it is in comparison to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.500 
gonna see how big it is in comparison to
my<00:04:28.370> little<00:04:28.610> heart<00:04:28.850> because<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.210> wanted<00:04:29.390> to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
my little heart because I wanted to

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.330 
my little heart because I wanted to
stick<00:04:29.720> out<00:04:29.870> either<00:04:30.229> side<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.919> then<00:04:31.100> when<00:04:31.220> I've

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
stick out either side and then when I've

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.370 
stick out either side and then when I've
got<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.520> it's<00:04:31.910> about<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.300> height<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.600> want<00:04:32.840> or

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
got it it's about the height you want or

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.350 
got it it's about the height you want or
length<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.830> want<00:04:34.010> you're<00:04:34.850> just<00:04:35.030> gonna<00:04:35.150> give

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
length you want you're just gonna give

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.409 
length you want you're just gonna give
it<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.630> trim<00:04:36.760> with<00:04:37.760> some<00:04:37.940> sharper<00:04:38.300> scissors

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
it a trim with some sharper scissors

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.110 
it a trim with some sharper scissors
than<00:04:38.750> what<00:04:38.840> I've<00:04:38.960> got<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.650> I'm<00:04:40.190> gonna<00:04:40.370> cut<00:04:41.000> off

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
than what I've got and I'm gonna cut off

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.580 
than what I've got and I'm gonna cut off
another<00:04:41.479> length<00:04:41.750> that's<00:04:42.020> just<00:04:42.229> a<00:04:42.320> little<00:04:42.470> bit

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
another length that's just a little bit

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.620 
another length that's just a little bit
shorter<00:04:43.250> than<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.840> one<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.560> I've<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:45.919> cut

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
shorter than the one that I've just cut

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.990 
shorter than the one that I've just cut
I'm<00:04:47.630> going<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.840> do<00:04:47.960> like<00:04:48.110> all<00:04:48.380> loops<00:04:49.870> okay

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.189 

so<00:04:54.000> I'm<00:04:54.120> gonna<00:04:54.300> get<00:04:54.509> one<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.690> our<00:04:54.840> fittings

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
so I'm gonna get one of our fittings

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.129 
so I'm gonna get one of our fittings
ready<00:04:57.199> I'm<00:04:58.199> taking<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.650> shot<00:04:58.919> or<00:04:59.220> now<00:05:00.139> we're

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
ready I'm taking the shot or now we're

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.749 
ready I'm taking the shot or now we're
just<00:05:01.259> gonna<00:05:01.470> loop<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.979> from<00:05:02.220> either<00:05:02.370> side<00:05:02.729> so

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
just gonna loop it from either side so

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.320 
just gonna loop it from either side so
that<00:05:03.180> crosses<00:05:03.570> in<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.780> middle<00:05:04.789> like<00:05:05.789> so<00:05:06.090> and

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
that crosses in the middle like so and

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.960 
that crosses in the middle like so and
I'm<00:05:06.449> just<00:05:06.630> going<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.810> put<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.050> pin<00:05:07.970> through

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
I'm just going to put that pin through

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.189 
I'm just going to put that pin through
the<00:05:09.000> center<00:05:09.419> if<00:05:09.509> I<00:05:09.630> what<00:05:09.780> I'll<00:05:09.870> do<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.080> I'll

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
the center if I what I'll do is I'll

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.590 
the center if I what I'll do is I'll
turn<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:11.310> join<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.789> the<00:05:11.880> back<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.360> can't

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
turn the join to the back so you can't

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.779 
turn the join to the back so you can't
see<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.810> as<00:05:12.870> much<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:14.009> we'll<00:05:14.160> pull<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.490> pin

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
see it as much and we'll pull that pin

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.920 
see it as much and we'll pull that pin
through<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.630> center<00:05:16.820> like<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:17.850> okay<00:05:18.780> then

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
through the center like that okay then

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.029 
through the center like that okay then
we'll<00:05:18.990> pick<00:05:19.169> up<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.380> other<00:05:19.470> one<00:05:19.530> we'll<00:05:19.800> do<00:05:19.889> the

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
we'll pick up the other one we'll do the

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:27.540 
we'll pick up the other one we'll do the
same<00:05:20.250> again

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.189 

it's<00:05:28.330> not<00:05:28.479> very<00:05:28.509> central<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.319> one<00:05:30.930> no<00:05:31.930> that's

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
it's not very central that one no that's

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.450 
it's not very central that one no that's
a<00:05:32.319> bit<00:05:32.440> better<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:32.770> I'll<00:05:32.860> turn<00:05:33.009> it<00:05:33.160> round<00:05:33.250> again

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
a bit better so I'll turn it round again

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.260 
a bit better so I'll turn it round again
and<00:05:34.770> I'm<00:05:35.770> gonna<00:05:35.919> put<00:05:36.129> this<00:05:36.580> now<00:05:36.819> through<00:05:37.150> the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
and I'm gonna put this now through the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.119 
and I'm gonna put this now through the
middle<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:39.039> one<00:05:40.289> okay<00:05:41.289> like<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:41.889> I<00:05:41.949> switch

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
middle of that one okay like so I switch

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.240 
middle of that one okay like so I switch
it<00:05:42.280> up<00:05:42.340> double<00:05:42.900> over<00:05:43.900> birth<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:44.620> then<00:05:45.069> what

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
it up double over birth and then what

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.170 
it up double over birth and then what
you're<00:05:45.340> gonna<00:05:45.430> do<00:05:45.669> is<00:05:45.789> you're<00:05:45.909> just<00:05:45.940> gonna

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
you're gonna do is you're just gonna

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.529 
you're gonna do is you're just gonna
place<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:46.860> in<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.009> cake<00:05:48.220> again<00:05:48.490> as<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.360> said

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
place it in the cake again as I said

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:50.969 
place it in the cake again as I said
before<00:05:49.690> make<00:05:50.050> sure<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.319> near<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:50.560> bottom<00:05:50.710> so

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
before make sure it's near the bottom so

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.320 
before make sure it's near the bottom so
that's<00:05:51.039> going<00:05:51.280> through<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.669> cake<00:05:52.120> board

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
that's going through the cake board

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.290 
that's going through the cake board
that's<00:05:52.539> under<00:05:53.020> your<00:05:53.889> cake<00:05:56.520> just<00:05:57.520> push<00:05:57.789> that<00:05:58.060> in

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
that's under your cake just push that in

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.790 
that's under your cake just push that in
like<00:05:58.840> so<00:05:59.159> so<00:06:00.159> we're<00:06:00.310> gonna<00:06:00.370> stick<00:06:00.699> this<00:06:01.800> just

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
like so so we're gonna stick this just

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.040 
like so so we're gonna stick this just
over<00:06:03.280> our<00:06:03.520> bar<00:06:03.759> in<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.090> corner<00:06:04.270> now<00:06:04.870> you<00:06:04.930> can

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
over our bar in the corner now you can

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.629 
over our bar in the corner now you can
use<00:06:05.169> royal<00:06:05.319> icing<00:06:05.500> which<00:06:05.770> works<00:06:06.009> well<00:06:06.190> or<00:06:06.400> I've
