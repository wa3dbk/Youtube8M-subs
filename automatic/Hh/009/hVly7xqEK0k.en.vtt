00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.339
 Hello in this medium I would like to introduce you 2 with which he very simply the 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.960
 Driver of our Windows XP installation 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.119
 can secure 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.230
 that has meanwhile rumgesprochen that one of programs especially from 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.789
 those of which one has no bump media 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.489
 for example because it is many from the internet 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.099
 a backup 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.140
 should make 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 we do this so that important or meaningful programs in one 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.880
 Baker still needs to land on the hard drive and if its full 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.040
 respectively 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.149
 correspondingly large, about four gigabytes in size 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.430
 then the whole thing is outsourced to a DVD 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 Of course you can now easily do that too 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.790
 make a big usb-stick then you need a maximum of action for maximum 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.390
 two more CDs 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.580
 the Windows CDU the bakers CD or DVD or even the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.530
 corresponding usb-stick 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 but in the whole game one often forgets the drivers 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.110
 that have accumulated over time on the old Biggs b installation 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.580
 and if the used had gotten older and older 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.560
 or Persilschein is quite exotic then it can be tight 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 appropriate driver still on the Internet to find 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.469
 yes her husband an example by adding a driver for a usb 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.719
 is then had adapter in the Internet just could not find more 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.580
 even in the then under Windows 98 is there such a tool 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 Saves valuable hours of time 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.890
 So it makes sense to backup the XP drivers as well 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 not at all either 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.500
 So start our standard browser and ask to default search engine 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 ranked for a program called da worldwide 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 so twice as expensive 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260
 we see our booth at 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.290
 point AK 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.350
 is, however 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 To produce this important US pick it because of the ball on it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.919
 as alternative 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.899
 the download of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 Points before they can of course still remain with the original 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 you have to click through accordingly 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.199
 Copy 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 the whole of his Tembo only lay 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.809
 double-click to install 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.969
 then we would only have the license terms 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.339
 everything is pretty fix and 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.340
 the sense makes after the installation directly at least the first 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.609
 Of course, you can always do that again afterwards 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 cover in case of cases that the hardware or the drivers 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.469
 have changed, for example, Manuel new drivers have installed 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.899
 but after the program 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.639
 After the first injury makes in any case are ever a stand 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 to secure 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.349
 the program is quite easy to use 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 We start by clicking on the Scan button 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.900
 Big Mama on it we already get all drivers of the system listed 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.409
 some are already chosen 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.839
 the most important the Microsoft 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.029
 Drivers for example to the standard Poors those are not 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.019
 approximated 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.730
 since these are virtually included in Windows XP so you have to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.569
 not necessarily in value 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.549
 Of course that can be that you still have a special driver too 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.389
 Microsoft did not necessarily reinstall later on Windows XP 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.419
 was the reason installation is in this respect also here I would say 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.799
 it does not hurt 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.340
 if we now at Lehmann balls in the appropriate driver, we just say 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.839
 choose everything we want everything for sure 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:05.319
 that's after us to say okay one driver the games I do not 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.879
 back again we are not forced after him 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.599
 when importing operator, I say now to indicate that all drivers 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.719
 have to be played back again 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.130
 but even if we are here by default even though it's for them 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.170
 Intel processor is running on that 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.880
 The system here is a thicker 7 processor from Windows XP 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.870
 respectively 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.169
 the driver correspond with secured something you can of course it is still 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.200
 Deselect if you can see it but it could also leave because like me 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.600
 already said we do not have to stand back at the end then here still on 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.889
 bake the baker 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.330
 the corresponding 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.090
 Specify location on the hard disk where the whole thing should be stored 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.800
 Unfortunately, there is nothing so I have to dial that Bern I put 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.229
 that in Stamford should be on the website 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.099
 Soldiers at Gabold Wahl what we see so very rarely so relaxed 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.319
 can mark all this if we take everything at all 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.939
 but I have to go here now 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.120
 a d 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.760
 Processor except beside downhill Selected Weiwei 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 Purchase okay click it things are tried 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.770
 and also done work becomes automatic 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.270
 Dr Explor pushed back to the fore the army now pushed the new one 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.210
 set up directory 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.850
 Semper idem 2 means now we are two again in that the calculator name 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.610
 is 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.240
 we do not try that now 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.360
 been given explicitly and here we have now according to ours 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.740
 Drivers threaten and if we just now to the system 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.599
 after the reinstallation become danger 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.090
 go to Taiwan if we go there if that's the driver for that 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.069
 want to update the corresponding device then we need the Explorer of 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.059
 the new Windows XP installation so only in this directory Thelosen 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.250
 and how to say okay usually install this driver and there will then 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.600
 Maybe the driver you have selected is older than the driver 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.099
 Primary School 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.559
 then they know that they can do without it 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.419
 or just about the driver to install normally 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.419
 and then we have the work of fun 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.900
 CD for example, target of this mouse 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.710
 to insert the CD so noticeable or looking for it on the Internet 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.789
 So it makes sense
