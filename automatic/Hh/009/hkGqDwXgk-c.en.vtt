not easy one of the first things you

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
not easy one of the first things you
want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.179> do<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:12.900> colony<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.530> set<00:00:13.860> up

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
want to do for your colony is set up

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.010 
want to do for your colony is set up
mining<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:15.059> what<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.660> select<00:00:15.960> your

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
mining so what you do is you select your

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.269 
mining so what you do is you select your
cargo<00:00:16.379> trucks<00:00:16.970> so<00:00:17.970> let<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.150> select<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.199> rude<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
cargo trucks so let it select a rude and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.920 
cargo trucks so let it select a rude and
in<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> lower<00:00:20.970> left-hand<00:00:21.330> corner<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.840> says

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
in the lower left-hand corner it says

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.779 
in the lower left-hand corner it says
set<00:00:22.199> path<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> mine<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.490> click<00:00:23.670> on

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
set path to mine so you just click on

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.880 
set path to mine so you just click on
your<00:00:23.939> mind<00:00:24.210> then<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.500> set<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
your mind then you want to set it this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.599 
your mind then you want to set it this
mind<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> smelter<00:00:26.939> such<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.279> now

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
mind to smelter such as that and now

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.560 
mind to smelter such as that and now
they'll<00:00:29.789> be<00:00:29.820> constantly<00:00:30.449> mining<00:00:32.570> another

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
they'll be constantly mining another

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.729 
they'll be constantly mining another
thing<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> want<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.380> start

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
thing you want to do is start

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
thing you want to do is start
researching<00:00:35.219> something<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:36.750> could<00:00:37.140> start

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
researching something we could start

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.670 
researching something we could start
with<00:00:37.530> health<00:00:38.340> maintenance<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.910> give<00:00:39.059> us

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
with health maintenance to give us

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
with health maintenance to give us
medical<00:00:40.680> centers<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> let<00:00:42.149> our<00:00:42.270> colony

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
medical centers to let our colony

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
medical centers to let our colony
colonists<00:00:43.350> live<00:00:43.530> longer<00:00:46.250> these<00:00:47.250> units<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
colonists live longer these units are

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.049 
colonists live longer these units are
called<00:00:48.000> convex<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.930> basically<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:50.100> create

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
called convex they basically can create

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
called convex they basically can create
any<00:00:51.239> structure<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> kid<00:00:52.920> from

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
any structure that you make a kid from

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
any structure that you make a kid from
at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> structure<00:00:54.090> factory<00:00:56.239> now<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
at the structure factory now because the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.950 
at the structure factory now because the
sound<00:00:58.020> wasn't<00:00:58.289> working<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.510> may<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.840> have

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
sound wasn't working you may not have

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
sound wasn't working you may not have
heard<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> said<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.039> power<00:01:02.280> levels

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
heard but it said the power levels

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
heard but it said the power levels
marginal<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:03.809> means<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.559> little

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
marginal which means we have very little

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
marginal which means we have very little
left<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.180> there's<00:01:06.390> only<00:01:06.540> 10

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
left as you can see that there's only 10

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.539 
left as you can see that there's only 10
units<00:01:07.110> left<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.250> tokamak<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.330> load

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
units left the tokamak that I just load

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.899 
units left the tokamak that I just load
that<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.850> loaded<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> tokamak<00:01:14.340> produces

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that just loaded is the tokamak produces

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
that just loaded is the tokamak produces
power<00:01:15.140> 250<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.560> later<00:01:16.770> upgrade<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
power 250 which you can later upgrade to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.499 
power 250 which you can later upgrade to
300<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.530> bad<00:01:19.799> thing<00:01:19.830> about<00:01:20.299> tokamaks<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
300 the one bad thing about tokamaks is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
300 the one bad thing about tokamaks is
over<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.350> slowly<00:01:22.619> deteriorate<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.640> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
over time they slowly deteriorate so you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:36.670 
over time they slowly deteriorate so you
have<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> prepare<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:24.509> every<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> then

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.450 

ok<00:01:38.750> now<00:01:39.750> another<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:40.110> our<00:01:40.560> food<00:01:40.920> storage<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
ok now another thing our food storage is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210 
ok now another thing our food storage is
diminishing<00:01:41.909> which<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:44.130> have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
diminishing which is not good so we have

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
diminishing which is not good so we have
to<00:01:44.340> build<00:01:44.460> an<00:01:44.610> acronym<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> produces

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to build an acronym because it produces

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
to build an acronym because it produces
food<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.240> go<00:01:48.420> build<00:01:50.299> agronomy<00:01:51.299> build<00:01:52.909> also

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
food so we go build agronomy build also

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
food so we go build agronomy build also
you<00:01:54.000> may<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> letters<00:01:55.439> are

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you may see that some of the letters are

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.069 
you may see that some of the letters are
red<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.549> means<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.909> that's<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.719> hotkey

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
red that means that that's the hotkey

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
red that means that that's the hotkey
for<00:01:58.110> them<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.820> I'm

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
for them so from now on that's what I'm

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.020 
for them so from now on that's what I'm
going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.210> using<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.399> storage<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
going to be using so as for storage and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to be using so as for storage and
then<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.689> too

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960 

now<00:02:09.940> here's<00:02:10.210> what<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.630> robo<00:02:11.050> surveyor<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.760> can

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
now here's what a robo surveyor they can

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.300 
now here's what a robo surveyor they can
they<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:13.930> basically<00:02:14.290> identify<00:02:15.040> what<00:02:15.280> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
they can basically identify what a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.730 
they can basically identify what a
mining<00:02:15.730> beacon<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.930> we'll<00:02:17.050> head<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> this

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
mining beacon is so we'll head to this

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.010 
mining beacon is so we'll head to this
yellow<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:19.000> white<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:19.630> means<00:02:19.870> it's

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
yellow this white one which means it's

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.580 
yellow this white one which means it's
unidentified<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.740> far<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.410> we're

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
unidentified so far the one we're

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.440 
unidentified so far the one we're
currently<00:02:23.740> using<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.370> 2<00:02:24.640> which<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.060> medium

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
currently using is 2 which is a medium

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.260 
currently using is 2 which is a medium
yield<00:02:25.780> there's<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.230> low<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.740> high<00:02:26.950> yield<00:02:27.370> three

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
yield there's a low and high yield three

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.310 
yield there's a low and high yield three
is<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> best<00:02:28.750> Oh<00:02:30.690> another<00:02:31.690> thing<00:02:31.810> about<00:02:32.020> the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
is the best Oh another thing about the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.280 
is the best Oh another thing about the
building<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:34.000> look<00:02:34.150> at<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.630> has<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
building if you look at it it has the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
building if you look at it it has the
center<00:02:35.620> yellow<00:02:36.010> which<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.210> actual

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
center yellow which is the actual

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.199 
center yellow which is the actual
building<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.080> then<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> tan<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.940> tan

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
building and then the tan the tan

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.830 
building and then the tan the tan
squares<00:02:40.600> are<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.260> tubes<00:02:41.500> all<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:43.630> about<00:02:43.720> all

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
squares are the tubes all just about all

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.570 
squares are the tubes all just about all
buildings<00:02:44.410> most<00:02:44.680> connected<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.220> command

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580

correctly<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:51.280> don't<00:02:51.459> have<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.700> be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
correctly and they don't have to be

current<00:02:52.090> connected<00:02:52.660> directly<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.200> could<00:02:53.380> pass

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
current connected directly it could pass

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.350 
current connected directly it could pass
through<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.890> building<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.000> bad<00:02:55.180> thing

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
through a building but the bad thing

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.880 
through a building but the bad thing
about<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.440> building<00:02:56.680> is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
about that is if this building is

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:19.119 
about that is if this building is
destroyed<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:57.520> these<00:02:57.910> become<00:02:58.300> disabled

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.089 

and<00:03:20.129> repair<00:03:20.519> those<00:03:21.290> now<00:03:22.290> we<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.560> start<00:03:22.830> also

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
and repair those now we can start also

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.520 
and repair those now we can start also
bulldozing<00:03:23.849> because<00:03:24.120> bulldozed<00:03:25.110> area

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
bulldozing because bulldozed area

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.699 
bulldozing because bulldozed area
actually<00:03:26.010> will<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:28.170> actually<00:03:28.470> let<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
actually will will actually let you

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.699 
actually will will actually let you
build<00:03:28.950> faster<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.640> move<00:03:29.819> faster<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
build faster and move faster on it and

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.830 
build faster and move faster on it and
might<00:03:31.709> as<00:03:31.799> well<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.489> because<00:03:32.840> your

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
might as well have it going because your

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.059 
might as well have it going because your
bulldozer<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.349> just<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.799> sitting

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
bulldozer is just going to be sitting

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.110 
bulldozer is just going to be sitting
there<00:03:35.160> anyway<00:03:37.370> alright<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.519> now<00:03:38.610> we<00:03:38.670> look<00:03:38.940> back

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
there anyway alright so now we look back

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.600 
there anyway alright so now we look back
at<00:03:39.330> our<00:03:39.450> morale<00:03:39.769> residents<00:03:40.769> demand<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.370> pretty

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
at our morale residents demand is pretty

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.869 
at our morale residents demand is pretty
not<00:03:42.180> bad<00:03:42.530> we<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.650> unoccupied<00:03:44.010> colonist<00:03:44.760> so

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
not bad we have unoccupied colonist so

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.309 
not bad we have unoccupied colonist so
we<00:03:45.000> just<00:03:45.120> have<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.390> find<00:03:45.540> stuff<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.080> them<00:03:46.170> to

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
we just have to find stuff for them to

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.470 
we just have to find stuff for them to
do<00:03:48.739> which<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.769> we<00:03:50.099> can<00:03:50.250> do<00:03:50.400> by<00:03:50.640> just<00:03:51.090> building

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
do which is we can do by just building

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.920 
do which is we can do by just building
stuff<00:03:56.239> another<00:03:57.239> thing<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:57.450> could<00:03:57.660> research

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
stuff another thing we could research

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.770 
stuff another thing we could research
cybernetic<00:04:00.930> teleportation<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:03.060> allows<00:04:03.750> us

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
cybernetic teleportation that allows us

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.860 
cybernetic teleportation that allows us
to<00:04:04.110> create<00:04:04.489> vehicle<00:04:05.489> factories<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.269> robot

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
to create vehicle factories and robot

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:22.760 
to create vehicle factories and robot
command<00:04:07.470> centers<00:04:07.799> which<00:04:07.980> help<00:04:08.430> your<00:04:08.579> colony

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.910 

now<00:04:23.770> think<00:04:24.190> with<00:04:24.400> medical<00:04:25.030> centers<00:04:25.770> they<00:04:26.770> can

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
now think with medical centers they can

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040 
now think with medical centers they can
support<00:04:27.100> 50<00:04:27.670> colonists<00:04:28.300> which<00:04:28.540> can<00:04:28.750> be<00:04:28.840> later

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
support 50 colonists which can be later

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.030 
support 50 colonists which can be later
upgraded<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.650> 75<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.960> want<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.770> keep<00:04:32.890> it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
upgraded to 75 and you want to keep it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.920 
upgraded to 75 and you want to keep it
as<00:04:33.220> low<00:04:33.400> as<00:04:33.580> possible<00:04:33.670> as<00:04:34.360> well<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.720> can

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
as low as possible as well as you can

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.130 
as low as possible as well as you can
possibly<00:04:35.290> get<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.890> because<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.280> lower<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.640> is

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
possibly get it because the lower it is

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.890 
possibly get it because the lower it is
the<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.770> lower<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:40.390> longer<00:04:40.720> your

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
the the lower it is the the longer your

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.680 
the the lower it is the the longer your
colonists<00:04:41.500> lips<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.190> better<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:43.540> higher

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
colonists lips of the better the higher

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.670 
colonists lips of the better the higher
your<00:04:44.200> population<00:04:44.650> will<00:04:44.920> grow<00:04:52.230> this<00:04:53.230> research

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
your population will grow this research

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.890 
your population will grow this research
actually<00:04:53.980> allows<00:04:54.400> us<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.850> increase<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.810> it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
actually allows us to increase it so it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.390 
actually allows us to increase it so it
goes<00:04:56.050> from<00:04:56.170> 50<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.650> 75<00:04:57.340> people<00:04:59.190> and<00:05:00.190> we'll

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
goes from 50 to 75 people and we'll

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.850 
goes from 50 to 75 people and we'll
build<00:05:00.670> another<00:05:00.910> one<00:05:01.140> like<00:05:02.760> there<00:05:04.710> now<00:05:05.710> when

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
build another one like there now when

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.770 
build another one like there now when
you<00:05:05.980> upgrade<00:05:06.190> something<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:07.120> says<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.630> on<00:05:07.720> the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
you upgrade something it says it on the

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.270 
you upgrade something it says it on the
building<00:05:08.200> like<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.620> says<00:05:08.860> increased

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
building like it says increased

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.250 
building like it says increased
colonists<00:05:09.730> capacity<00:05:10.300> on<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.510> residency<00:05:11.020> so

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
colonists capacity on the residency so

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.320 
colonists capacity on the residency so
that<00:05:11.380> means<00:05:11.590> it's<00:05:11.800> instead<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.520> supporting<00:05:12.760> 25

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
that means it's instead of supporting 25

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.970 
that means it's instead of supporting 25
each<00:05:13.960> one<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.560> could<00:05:14.920> support<00:05:15.010> 35<00:05:15.610> colonists

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
each one it could support 35 colonists

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.310 
each one it could support 35 colonists
this<00:05:17.980> is<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.280> University<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.690> allows<00:05:20.050> you<00:05:20.200> to

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
this is the University it allows you to

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.410 
this is the University it allows you to
train<00:05:20.590> train<00:05:21.570> workers<00:05:22.570> into<00:05:23.050> scientists<00:05:24.420> and

worker<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:10.300> build<00:06:10.510> the<00:06:10.630> tube

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:26.300 

now<00:06:18.630> now<00:06:19.260> it's<00:06:19.440> now<00:06:20.160> it's<00:06:20.280> working<00:06:25.250> all<00:06:26.250> right

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
now now it's now it's working all right

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.670

columnist so we want to try to find them
something<00:06:33.389> to<00:06:33.540> do<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:39.330> now<00:06:39.480> if<00:06:39.630> you<00:06:39.720> look<00:06:39.870> at

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
something to do and now if you look at

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.890 
something to do and now if you look at
this<00:06:40.200> robust<00:06:41.160> a<00:06:41.340> surveyor<00:06:42.060> could<00:06:42.780> actually

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
this robust a surveyor could actually

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.379 
this robust a surveyor could actually
identify<00:06:43.530> what<00:06:43.800> was<00:06:44.010> that<00:06:44.220> white<00:06:44.730> beacon<00:06:45.210> was

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
identify what was that white beacon was

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.090 
identify what was that white beacon was
and<00:06:45.660> it's<00:06:45.870> actually<00:06:45.960> a<00:06:46.169> high-yield<00:06:46.680> so<00:06:46.889> if<00:06:47.010> you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
and it's actually a high-yield so if you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.710 
and it's actually a high-yield so if you
want<00:06:47.280> to<00:06:47.340> expand<00:06:47.730> this<00:06:47.910> isn't<00:06:48.270> a<00:06:48.330> terrible

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
want to expand this isn't a terrible

00:06:48.720 --> 00:07:13.490 
want to expand this isn't a terrible
place<00:06:48.930> to<00:06:48.960> build<00:06:49.530> it<00:07:11.810> now<00:07:12.810> we<00:07:12.870> know<00:07:13.110> that<00:07:13.139> some

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
place to build it now we know that some

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.800 
place to build it now we know that some
maps<00:07:13.740> you<00:07:14.130> don't<00:07:14.520> start<00:07:14.880> without<00:07:15.060> this<00:07:15.479> entire

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
maps you don't start without this entire

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.080 
maps you don't start without this entire
colony<00:07:16.260> you<00:07:16.650> have<00:07:16.770> to<00:07:16.889> have<00:07:17.100> to<00:07:17.250> research<00:07:17.669> to
