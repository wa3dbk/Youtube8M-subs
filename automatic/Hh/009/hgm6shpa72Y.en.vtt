00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello my name is Gregory I want 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.830
 tell how to lubricate the chain and clean 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 transmission in order to produce 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.000
 any work needs to be flipped 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.190
 bike so how are we going to switch 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.880
 stars for easy switching 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.279
 speeds 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.109
 set aside anything steady patrol 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.519
 we close the bicycle seat with packages 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.519
 so as not to hurt him 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.260
 before you need to lubricate the chain 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 clean the transmissions for this 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.670
 use ear sticks 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.670
 start by cleaning the stars of the cassette 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.780
 put the stars in the lowest position 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.780
 start cleaning the big stars 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.680
 put the stars of extreme merck not by 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.680
 don't start cleaning little stars 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 Star clearing is over 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.450
 We enter the cleaning carriage do 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.850
 similar to cassette 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.740
 put in a lower position 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.740
 we clean the big and middle star 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 we put more upper put 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.290
 no clearing a little star 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.400
 also need to clear the guides 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 chain stars 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.470
 after completion other 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.840
 all stars clean all mechanisms which 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.930
 responsible for switching speeds from 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.709
 dust of dirt and sand for this can also be 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 you can still use ear sticks 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.940
 use a toothbrush 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.900
 clean the chain for this we take any rag 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 we wrap the chain in one place and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.030
 starting to pedal after this 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.680
 procedures the rest of the mud we beat out 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.400
 hole chain links 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.400
 ear sticks 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.270
 this complete transmission cleaning 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.420
 proceed to the very lubrication of the chain for this 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 put the spout of the oiler in the center of the plexus 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.460
 links pedal and slowly we press 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.710
 to grease to grease out 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.480
 evenly over the entire surface of the chain 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.250
 also doing from the opposite side 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.860
 chain and stars do not necessarily lubricate 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 the lubricant itself must be transferred from the chain to 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.530
 stars if you go too far with grease 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.840
 then to 7 transmission systems on sticks 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.860
 very quickly and much dirt will 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.070
 droop as much porridge if not to be able to 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.230
 that is, the risk of star friction options 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.690
 shifting speeds which leads to 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.950
 Transmission wear will be very 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.950
 attentive and careful 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.630
 on this I finish my story with everything 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.370
 thanks who watched my video put 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.299
 thumbs up and subscribe to my 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.299
 channel all bye
