00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.959
 the olive leaf is the mirror of the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.219
 nutritional status of the plant in this 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.469
 report we are going to talk about the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.539
 importance of foliar analysis in this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.060
 cultivation and the advantages it offers to 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.980
 the farmers who decide to do it in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 olive cultivation foliar analysis 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.450
 is one of the axes on which 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 supports a good subscriber plan and / or my 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.199
 students when I give lectures to the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.440
 farmers always say that the one that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.750
 can do on three legs to be able 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.629
 make a good fertilization the first 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 would be to know well the soil to be able to have 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.870
 a good soil analysis and know the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.060
 soil operation 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.130
 it's not worth only with analysis in second 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.200
 place a foliar analysis foliar analysis 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.630
 it's a bit of a diagnosis of how it is 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 the plant and the third would be a good 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.920
 evaluation of extractions ie 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.660
 we could say that the amount of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.180
 nutrient elements that are in the soil 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.580
 we can say that it is like 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 from what there is a current account to 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.750
 year we jump and we put what we have to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700
 try to keep more or less 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.280
 at appropriate levels with this simple 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.260
 gesture we get a still picture of the current 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.300
 nutritional status of the plant without 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.910
 However, it is much more interesting to have 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.130
 a historical that helps us evaluate the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.590
 nutritious evolution of the tree but 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 when and how to take the sample 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.770
 normally from danish and julie about 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.260
 Take from the middle to the end of July 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 which is a time when you linked it 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.010
 we could say it stabilizes as soon as 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 to nutrient content before is very 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.119
 oscillating throughout the nitrogen is a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640
 key element and we compare it with years 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.369
 previous of how is the olive tree well 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 that same time then maybe a photo 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.580
 fixed is not enough or must be done is 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.320
 a comparison of how the state is 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.970
 nutritive of the olive along the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.550
 time when taking the samples 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.200
 that the olive tree is not homogeneous that is to say 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.060
 you have to take from the different 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 orientations we could say putting 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.830
 orientation north-south east-west of the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.960
 four orientations and that we could 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.000
 take from the olive tree is always recommended 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 that leaves are taken at the height of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.810
 eyes of the person 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.190
 demonstrating also have to take 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080
 from the inside of the part 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.580
 outside because normally in the part 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.220
 interior the concentration of nutrients 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 is less what seems incredible in the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.450
 Top available information 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.489
 that we get with these analyzes we 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.770
 show the main nutrients that 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.720
 interact in our olive groves there is a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.510
 big mistake as to what they are 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.280
 the foliar analysis is that many times 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.930
 they try to look for deficiencies in elements 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.850
 as for example it can be the dog and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 however, iron is not 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 indicative on the sheet that there is a 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 lack of that element 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.010
 but normal would be nitrogen phosphorus 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.310
 potassium as macronutrient elements 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.350
 important or majority and some 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.350
 micronutrients such as boron 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.300
 how magnesium can be the first thing 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.489
 what it does is when we arrive with the sheet 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.290
 of the laboratory is to wash it to avoid 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.910
 the fact that contaminations by 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.310
 game processing example such 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.930
 a typical parameter that with copper are 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.850
 impregnated on the surface of the sheet 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.640
 and give results that are not valid 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.350
 that sheet is washed and automatically 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.710
 pass on the stove is meat 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.780
 we leave it approximately 45 days 160 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.670
 I have degrees centigrade at most already 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.810
 then what it does is is crushed 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.100
 the sample 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.960
 and the percentage of humidity is calculated 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.990
 we have to express the 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.400
 results in value to the dry sample and 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.230
 from there that we have already crushed 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.960
 the sample and we started doing the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.580
 different attacks to calculate the 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.520
 content in nitrogen the content in 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.590
 phosphorus and the potassium content in 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.180
 different electronic and is that having 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.830
 in mind that one of the main 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.080
 inputs in the olive grove are the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.210
 fertilizers the foliar analysis we 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.220
 can help save money or improve 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.950
 the economic results of our 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.410
 exploitation will not say that there are people who do not 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.990
 has fertilized in your life and that you continue 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.050
 taking olive effectively that's 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.730
 well but what they do not know is what they leave 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.320
 to catch every year for not fertilizing 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.630
 then do a fertilization 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.280
 correct is very important in any 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.810
 crop but in the case of the olive grove more 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.880
 because we can save a lot of money 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.710
 because the same thing that we talked about 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.330
 previous case we talked about the case of 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.880
 it is used every year with the same 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.060
 amount without thinking if you're 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.070
 elements in excess that probably 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.720
 happen the most and no other 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.180
 thing another thing that is also 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.859
 curious 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.870
 and it's because there are chemical elements like 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.060
 example the potassium that many times 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.460
 found in excess in the soil and that 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.820
 the plant an excess of potassium is not going to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.720
 have no benefit in saying what 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.479
 that occurs in the so-called 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.669
 luxury consumption where the plant starts 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.440
 to absorb a chemical element and not by 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.360
 that's going to get more production and better 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.210
 quality something that not only affects 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.440
 positively to the pocket but also 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.440
 to the environment
