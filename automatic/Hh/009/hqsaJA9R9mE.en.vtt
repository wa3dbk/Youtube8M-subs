00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
so the first step you will need to do is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
so the first step you will need to do is
grab<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.590> shoe<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> grab<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.700> brush<00:01:44.880> and

I'm in real slow and make sure I do the
job<00:02:45.850> right<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.930> basically<00:02:47.260> you'll<00:02:47.530> dip<00:02:48.100> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280

inside<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.940> then<00:02:49.660> sway<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.410> one<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:51.700> one

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
inside and then sway it one in one

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.740 
inside and then sway it one in one
direction<00:02:52.180> once<00:02:52.690> again<00:02:53.790> make<00:02:54.790> sure<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:55.150> it's

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
direction once again make sure you it's

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.120 
direction once again make sure you it's
just<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:55.989> brushing<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:56.890> direction

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
just like brushing and one direction

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
just like brushing and one direction
