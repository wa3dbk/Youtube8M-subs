00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.069
 to a question about shortened ranks 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.630
 of the abyssal it was the question 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.219
 it was mostly a return point 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 what it is and good is where 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.320
 we turn we turn the ranks at the moment 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 where we make shortcuts 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.050
 so concretely right away in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.439
 quick of the subject I have my wedding witness 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.539
 I dropped the lace and I 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 have to say that I got to rank 1 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.480
 I made rank 1 we only knit 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.160
 130 mesh or 148 we stop in progress 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 of road and we turn 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 I advise to use it in addition two 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.440
 markers you will see why 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 then knit 8 knit at 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 upside down while I'm going to do it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 knit one and I will put markers 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.600
 behind that is to spot where 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:05.780
 we shot just one two three 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 four five sets 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.650
 8 like this in shorthand because we have 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.970
 really a little while 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.409
 we let others down for a moment 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.479
 by dropping it sorts the CO2 per year 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.479
 we keep them on needles and we turn 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 then knit this insurgent mesh 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:38.240
 simple and 3 my so this mesh even 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:38.240
 thing I put a marker of 3.4 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.880
 5-6 that was fine this is I'm falling on 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.300
 the place where I made my return all to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.090
 the time I am his point of return and 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.160
 there we make simple insurgents ie 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.369
 than the mesh where we turned everything to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:07.270
 the time we do on ge is simple with 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:09.600
 the next hand then 3 lease 1 2 3 on 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.600
 turned 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.900
 then we are told knitting said my 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 mesh together upside down so 10 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:44.239
 the same I do a is a marker 2 3 4 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:45.739
 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the 10th and like everything to 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.590
 the time we arrive on the marker there we 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.520
 turned and marry glass assembly 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.650
 so I 'm going to get to the point of 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
 back a mesh before finally back 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:05.050
 and the ama eelv we made the return we got it 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.050
 knit with each other and work 1 2 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.800
 3 and we'll do it until the end 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 a re incorporated all the stitches on 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.820
 turn we knit so we are told 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.950
 more how much to knit mesh 7 10 11 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.630
 13 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.920
 we simply say we give our big 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.060
 principle ie we knit 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.080
 until nam hai preceding the turn around 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.880
 so when we have markers it's 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.880
 easy it's up to the marker 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.880
 but it's okay it's going to get longer 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.990
 necessarily hero sees more 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:10.489
 long so up to the insurgent marker 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:22.650
 simple and work of three one turns to 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:26.810
 knit marked up to the marker and 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.810
 do that until you get to the top 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.250
 I think that's understood 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.060
 ah yes so just one last time on 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.200
 the reverses and two sets towards 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.700
 so up to the marker so there I 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.110
 really not to worry about taking 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.570
 the head to know where I shot try 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.260
 to spot I put the marker I do 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.400
 two together 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:54.510
 I do not forget to put the thread in front 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:58.310
 two sets and 3.1 three years 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.100
 turn a place 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.169
 markers and here we go again 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.410
 re incorporates little by little all the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.250
 mesh and that's what will form this 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.250
 nice to robbie 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.950
 this time the m plus the cable that 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.200
 just put the mess a little there 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.560
 in 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.560
 that's the principle
