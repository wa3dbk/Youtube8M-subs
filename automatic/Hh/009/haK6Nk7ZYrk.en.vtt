00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi and welcome to this tutorial or 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.310
 today I propose to discover 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.760
 how to properly test your sites on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 internet explorer 8 9 is high 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.130
 you know it internet explorer 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.480
 unfortunately it's the bÃªte noire 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 few integrators and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 developers but because he understands 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 nothing else the other problem and it's really 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.020
 the real problem I have with ethan 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.609
 hawke proof is that it's very boring 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.939
 to test on older versions 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.529
 indeed internet explorer for example 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.580
 or eight students are only available 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 on some versions of the system 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 operating windows 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 that is, when you are well 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.180
 on windows 8 for example you do not have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 absolutely no way to install 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.890
 internet explorer 8 to test so he 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 there are several solution solutions 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 more or less viable you will see it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 so the first solution is the most 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.000
 natural is at the level of internet 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.020
 so explore the latest version that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 you have on your system 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 you take out the inspector and on the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 left column you go up 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.930
 emulation and you will be able to actually 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 emulate your site with some 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
 version of the document 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 so there for example I checked 8 a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.270
 little bit everywhere and you see that my 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.830
 site appears completely farted then 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.270
 I tested on nothing in the experts 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 guests it does not give this result no 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.540
 more so the problem of emulation that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
 allows you to detect maybe 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.960
 some problems but I found that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.570
 the results were too operatic 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 to really be usable there is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.659
 other solutions like for example 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 yves testers who will allow you a 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.630
 little bit the same but who according to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.610
 me the same problems ie 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.280
 that he does not see the same bugs a real 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.259
 browser and while wicked 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.820
 tendency to plant 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.049
 you have other services then there 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 I primo last but there are 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.200
 a whole lot that allow you to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 take screenshots of your 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.150
 site 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.890
 so that's the solution between 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.720
 quotes the simplest but not 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.159
 not necessarily very practical since I 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.299
 you generally wanted to 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 navigate between the pages to see the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.729
 different bugs 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.229
 there you'll just see the problems 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.710
 visuals not necessarily the problems 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.659
 javascript or whatever so the solution that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 we stay is the only solution that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.320
 apparently is viable that's all 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.360
 just to have a free internet here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.020
 in eight a real internet explorer 9 and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.460
 so on 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.829
 so if you do not have an old 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.240
 computer in the corner of your living room 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.610
 bett it's a bit problematic 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.680
 so you have two solutions a first 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.520
 service called own browser stack 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.830
 so this is a service that I have not 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.530
 really tested but who offers you to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 through the cloud to have access to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.710
 different versions of the browser and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.930
 really able to navigate 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.910
 the main problem that this service 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.400
 it is that it pays to listen for the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.110
 first version 40 dollars a month this 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.670
 which is still an investment 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 but he proposes another solution that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.240
 is nice and does not require you 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.490
 not to pay which is the use of 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.660
 virtual machines 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.420
 so the idea is that we will be able to create 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.280
 virtual machines that are already 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.730
 configured and who are ready to be 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.710
 launched 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.840
 so you must first configure 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.560
 choose the operating system what 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.720
 you will use 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.450
 so me here i'm going to use windows and 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.550
 then the virtualization system that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.140
 so you used me in my case 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.760
 I use virtualbox so I use 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.870
 also for waves make what makes me 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.990
 allows to mount the virtual machines 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.610
 linux to do tests and then 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.050
 you see that you have different 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.220
 machines so different systems 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.190
 operating and different machines 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.380
 to be able to test abba your site 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.490
 so me the most problematic case in 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.140
 general cio 8 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.910
 but it's true that I also meet 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.110
 problems on ie9 so what you 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.060
 can do it's installed for example 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is this machine the machine cover there 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.780
 so me for the example I chose 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.950
 windows xp because it was the most 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.410
 light I do not want to spend two 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.820
 hours to install ie9 so once that 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.780
 you are going to have these different parts 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.980
 you will end up with a 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.780
 folder structure that is pretty much 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.550
 similar so you have an exe point 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.410
 you double click and it will allow 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.060
 to actually extract all the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.860
 different files and that you you 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.480
 extract a point we will see if you have 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.610
 selected 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.440
 virtualbox so when you double click 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.480
 is automatically it's going to install on 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.070
 virtual box your black cloud machine a 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.959
 some memory you can change a 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.700
 little bit the parameters but I have 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.620
 left the default settings so 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.990
 here I chose a windows xp machine 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.550
 and if you open virtualbox you go 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.770
 have you see this new machine 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.570
 so here it is very very little ram 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.730
 but it's more than enough to 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.140
 windows xp and it contains eighteen 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.810
 so if he will allow me to be able to 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.360
 to test my sites on the internet explorer 8 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.790
 so if you want it lit you have it 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.330
 selected and gets you started 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.340
 unlike virtual machines 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.639
 linux there you're going to have in a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.430
 window that goes apart 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.189
 to be that will contain your system so 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.319
 as if you had a new screen but 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:31.039
 which contains your machine so it puts 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.870
 a small 1 to start is normal but 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.009
 it's relatively fast if you have 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.240
 need to do a test here you 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.639
 do not have to report in more 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.659
 25 minutes and you have the right to the 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.659
 little boot music 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.039
 who will bring you full of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.070
 memories and you can test internet 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.680
 explore gets you started 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.210
 internet just explore a little detail 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.949
 I encountered a little problem me at 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.550
 first start I know that the keyboard 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.169
 is qwerty 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.030
 but you still have the possibility 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.280
 to go into the preferences I know 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.500
 more where I was I pulled out something like 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.360
 that and in the preferences you can 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.039
 add keyboards so at level 2 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.419
 at the parameter level you create a 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.800
 new keyboard in french if you are 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.320
 in French like that it will settle you 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.180
 all your problems and well there you are you 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.570
 now have a real internet 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.820
 so explore if you want to test yourself 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.530
 typing the url and you see that the at 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.030
 passage playing my site and that he 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.490
 works pretty well eat the bar of 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.500
 search is completely fooled but 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.220
 unlike the rendering I had when 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.110
 emulation 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.580
 you see that it gives a result that 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.410
 is still a lot more logical 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.669
 if I had just based myself on 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.500
 the emulation I would have looked for the bugs 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.460
 while there was none so that's it 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.479
 the windows xp machine is relatively 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.750
 Light quotes it is true that 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.190
 when you are going to want to debug on 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.020
 ie9 for example it's a little bit a 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.300
 hair more boring since each parent the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.789
 girl makes a gig you pretty much 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.599
 for 5 gigabytes of systems so that's 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.460
 true it's a little boring of 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.820
 having to install as many machines but 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.590
 it allows you to install it simply 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.340
 so here is overall I think that 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.750
 that's all I wanted you 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.139
 show on using this 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.669
 machine 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.320
 so I chose internet explorer 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.139
 8 finally to really test on the internet 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.490
 sport 8 because it's a version that 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.840
 is blocked on windows xp ie 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.669
 that the user even if he wishes 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.500
 can not update to 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.940
 additional versions what is 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.860
 not the case on windows 7 or windows 8 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.930
 that each update of almost 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.120
 windows automatically updates you 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.199
 a feat is more rare to find 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.330
 people who have old 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.490
 internet versions of explorer so that's 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.509
 a service that is rather useful if you 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.860
 you shut up you want to test like that 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.060
 on old versions that you 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.220
 have not seen that it is not possible to 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.960
