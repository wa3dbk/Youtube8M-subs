00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
like that so just in case you were

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.020

wondering<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.560> was<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.370> black

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
wondering so this was a black

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:50.149 
wondering so this was a black
paramilitary<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:38.130> now<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.950> cool

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:03:07.040 

nice<00:02:52.049> that<00:02:53.049> looks<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.530> cool

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.600 

it<00:03:07.410> sounds<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:07.920> catching<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.430> little

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
it sounds like it's catching a little

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.250 
it sounds like it's catching a little
bit<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.440> look<00:03:10.590> into<00:03:10.800> that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:25.460 

but<00:03:15.860> this<00:03:16.489> looks<00:03:16.790> really<00:03:17.120> nice

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.470 

yeah<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.640> lot

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
very cool so here is I guess this is the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.550 
very cool so here is I guess this is the
screw<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:37.890> was<00:03:38.099> stuck<00:03:39.080> I'm<00:03:40.080> not<00:03:40.379> sure<00:03:42.560> but

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
screw that was stuck I'm not sure but

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.500 
screw that was stuck I'm not sure but
that<00:03:43.769> also<00:03:44.190> came<00:03:44.489> in<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.819> box<00:03:47.330> really<00:03:48.330> nice

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
that also came in this box really nice

00:03:48.510 --> 00:04:00.020 
that also came in this box really nice
look<00:03:48.810> in<00:03:48.959> paramilitary

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:12.400 

no<00:04:00.600> blade<00:04:00.870> play

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.630 

pretty<00:04:13.040> cool<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:15.080> I<00:04:15.440> really<00:04:15.950> like<00:04:16.160> how<00:04:16.370> about
