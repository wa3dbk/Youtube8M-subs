emotionally involved and it seems like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
emotionally involved and it seems like
it's<00:02:36.330> her<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> reason<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> say<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.440> is

because<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:38.310> person<00:02:38.730> needs<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
because one person needs to be the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.780 
because one person needs to be the
initiator<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.830> person<00:02:41.190> needs<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.640> that

initiator one person needs to have that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
initiator one person needs to have that
interest<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> where<00:02:42.450> they<00:02:43.050> call<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.470> up

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
interest to where they call you up

otherwise<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:44.580> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.090> breaks<00:02:45.330> apart

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
otherwise it just kind of breaks apart

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.820 
otherwise it just kind of breaks apart
because<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.020> poked<00:02:46.260> hard<00:02:46.470> emotionally

goes so far it's only so much of a
motivator<00:02:50.730> now<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.870> isn't<00:02:52.050> exactly<00:02:52.590> your

that<00:03:17.489> boiling<00:03:17.760> point<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.239> unfortunately<00:03:19.170> it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
that boiling point and unfortunately it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.380 
that boiling point and unfortunately it
is<00:03:19.620> your<00:03:20.010> responsibility<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.910> end<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.270> because

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
is your responsibility to end it because

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.080 
is your responsibility to end it because
she<00:03:22.020> might<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.440> love<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.830> love<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.610> blind

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
she might be in love and love is blind

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.479 
she might be in love and love is blind
she's<00:03:24.690> probably<00:03:24.900> hoping<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:25.709> as<00:03:25.920> long<00:03:26.280> as

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
she's probably hoping then as long as

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.760 
she's probably hoping then as long as
she<00:03:26.670> keeps<00:03:26.850> herself<00:03:27.090> available<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:28.050> sees<00:03:28.620> you

on<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> regular<00:03:29.130> basis<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.540> you're<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
on a regular basis that you're going to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.020 
on a regular basis that you're going to
develop<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> same<00:03:31.980> feelings<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.580> her<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.880> it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.970 
develop the same feelings for her and it
doesn't<00:03:33.510> seem<00:03:33.660> like<00:03:33.690> that's<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.200> case<00:03:34.380> now

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
doesn't seem like that's the case now

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370 
doesn't seem like that's the case now
you're<00:03:35.310> both<00:03:35.489> 18<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.630> right<00:03:36.810> now<00:03:36.840> it's<00:03:37.140> not

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.690 
you're both 18 so right now it's not
much<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.770> problem<00:03:38.010> she's<00:03:38.280> got<00:03:38.430> her<00:03:38.520> whole

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
much of a problem she's got her whole

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.490 
much of a problem she's got her whole
life<00:03:38.910> ahead<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.209> her<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:40.050> could<00:03:40.110> go<00:03:40.470> on

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
life ahead of her but this could go on

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.080 
life ahead of her but this could go on
for<00:03:40.890> years<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.250> that's<00:03:41.520> when<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.790> become<00:03:42.030> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
for years and that's when you become a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.540 
for years and that's when you become a
douchebag<00:03:42.530> because<00:03:43.530> then<00:03:43.650> you've<00:03:43.770> taken<00:03:43.980> her

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550
