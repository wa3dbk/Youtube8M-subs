00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 Today I want to come back with one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.020
 easy meeting deal with you 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 It's really important always 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 his seat in his orientation 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 his simultaneous with his 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.780
 Coordination and sensitivity as 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 rider really a rider to live long 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.859
 work and that's why I want you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.109
 Imagine a simple exercise like that in the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 end up your coordination but also 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.990
 your skis for your own natural 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.119
 crooked and, so to speak, yours 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.119
 suppleness in the seat can be improved 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.630
 the theoretical juggle or fictitious 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.040
 juggle 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.900
 that means one imagines one has 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.610
 a ball of small ball in his hand 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.870
 and we on this ball of the one 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.970
 hand in the other 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.100
 I 'm doing this fictional juggle altogether 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.739
 a lot with my students in the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.930
 Step in the gallop in all 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.460
 Of course you can do that too 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.740
 if you are still reasonably good 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.240
 is and a fenced riding area 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.650
 Of course you can do that too 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.060
 Just ride a horse 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.440
 Of course it is important that you have one 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.690
 Take care that the island 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.130
 approximately always centered on the neck 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.500
 that does not stay one at a time 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 page will be forever long and thereby the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.790
 Horse danger runs sometime 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.170
 enter but is important just 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 that you either otherwise a small one 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.460
 making knots in the trains or easy 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 if you have that I have that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.399
 for example, at my baroque, the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 possibility that I quickly to a 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.780
 bit on this calls like her 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.240
 so to speak, then it stays off us 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.830
 elastic but loose or if 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.090
 I see that the ski trains then leads 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.570
 I have to stop him right now 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
 do 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.350
 So I can do it in a rhythm, so to speak 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 then I can make that smaller 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.920
 so to speak, I just realized that 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.450
 makes small movements or at 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 a very big and fourth big one 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.830
 I can move accordingly, too 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.140
 my hand movement synchronize 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.000
 the movement of the horse and so can 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.460
 also my tact feel for 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.240
 to improve this horse 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.090
 we look at the now in the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.229
 various gear types shortly 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.390
 I can of course combine as well 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.549
 simultaneously with this juggling 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.310
 upper body rotation exercise if I want 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.390
 or the head movement that makes 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.150
 of course, then already reasonably 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.519
 complex or I can too 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.060
 vary with different seating types 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.350
 that means you can easily sit out or 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.560
 relief seat or springs 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.540
 and of course those are the limits to the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.640
 possibilities no limits set me 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.130
 in the end I can steadily myself 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.110
 improve and train around really 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.209
 also a good rider and therefore also a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.049
 good coordinative hand neither 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.049
 to become a rider
