00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.400
 Document correspondent is Tteyuu today University of Tokyo 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 Therefore, So I bought into that Co-op 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 Yule's Rena 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.240
 Large screw 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:23.539
 Thats common Toka recently Come green insect cookies from around here 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.410
 Of the science of life 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.720
 It's a key that shows me in the middle position 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.670
 a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.739
 It says that Euglena is officially'm twilight say in Tsu Gurasshisu 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 It is a little different from Midorimushi water because it is a guy like Midorimushi 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 Precisely, it's a private beaten evening 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.909
 Well 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 Or it became so Do from softening 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:58.399
 Euglena you're doing it in that light hits those who 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.399
 Then it will be an instant product to photosynthesis in the evening sky 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.780
 so 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:10.159
 Let's say that there is no light 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:12.110
 Do not photosynthetic jump so that with the eyebrows freely coat swim and a guy near you 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.110
 I'm eating a job and eating 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:22.970
 This means that of the carnivorous 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:27.470
 So one answer is because I whether or become plant or become carnivorous Euglena 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.400
 It is a microbe called a living squirrel but I made it 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.650
 Funny that flour twist 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:41.770
 Cane in I'm this an evening of warehouse series in Abu roller twilight of life squirrel 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.620
 I love carbon dioxide, so I eat that much carbon dioxide that produced that human being 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.540
 The 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:51.630
 Fix co2 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.430
 And it became quite famous because it was said that it would also be food in the corner 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.490
 We are global warming 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.940
 Yes, it also helps prevent global warming. 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.940
 I 'm glad to solve that food problem 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.140
 It would be nice 5 schools 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.750
 I thought 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.530
 Euglena Brushless 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.580
 Umm this is a little bit that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.430
 More and more given the high feed 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.750
 Euglena that has increased the amount of carbon dioxide so maybe this is fixed 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 I do not think that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 It's kind of like a crawler or something like that's a cross . 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.190
 By saying 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.050
 About maybe 200 yen Forgot might was going 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.560
 Of the University of Tokyo 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.800
 It doesn't matter 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.280

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.630
 I've sold at the University of Tokyo Co-op 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 That I hope is a per under the Yasuda code 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.950
 If you're not forgotten in your math 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.670
 I ate a little bit to say that this is delicious 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.140
 By say 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.140
