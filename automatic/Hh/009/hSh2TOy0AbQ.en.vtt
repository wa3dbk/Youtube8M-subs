00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.240
 Chapter 2 Construction Ordinance Classification and Demand Performance 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.120
 There are a lot of problems here, 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.550
 Maybe you should read it. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.179
 Now when bosige in the building materials sector classification classification yesterday trillion in June 2007 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:27.069
 It came out in the year, but it is not so difficult. What is natural material? Natural 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:29.289
 The material is a natural material. Stone . 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:34.570
 Then, in the case of artificial materials 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:39.070
 Can I'd made you see the factory metal products and that Im ou 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:43.179
 It would not baked're going to roast me once again like dirt Secretary Petroleum Products 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:48.219
 Products from the party we'll get a lot of plastic products are so classified 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:52.420
 Itgoyo is that there is the next sorted by the intended use on the structure 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:56.649
 Ugh, why are you closing any material which material is delivered blocking material issues 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.929
 You can read it once in a while so it's not that difficult. 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.769
 You 'll be able to get rid of it . 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:06.700
 Then it is affixed by the chemical composition . 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:10.900
 If such an organic material is a natural material of synthetic resin into weapons still there 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.170
 The material is non-metallic and there you go into the metal. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.740
 It will not be that difficult if you look at me . 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:25.090
 Now the structure characterized by the material required for the control structure when bosige as building materials 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.150
 The same things came out for the exam. So, 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.630
 The same will be a structural sin. 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:38.440
 Well there are features I do have a uniform intensity Can you most of what you 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.340
 It's got to be uniform and strong, because you have to get the power. 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.960
 Then I'd like to have a high durability and fire resistance. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.130
 If the subtitle is too heavy again, the recording is difficult and it is hard for us to listen. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.790
 It is good to be able to easily obtain light and large materials 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.600
 And it would be better if it was easy to process. 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.330
 Here are then listed on the roof also features Gary in the case of zero now 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.270
 Of course it should be light, and the roof will be waterproof after that. 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:13.090
 The thermal conductivity is low so it's gonna be cool right now . 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:17.470
 Such features do anything slip, then the closure of wall and ceiling materials are also listed in the Features 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.890
 You have to look after them. The wall ceiling should have a good appearance. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:26.170
 Why do you need it? 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.100
 Thermal Conductivity is recommended to be small and if you like to finish the floor 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.970
 If the same floor, if not well cleaned I do have a lot of cattle for a total of sucks 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.130
 It's me. 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:41.080
 And when it risks slipping I'll like that of the less jjyeoyo Lena sketches 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 So I absorb that shock a little so I need to be able to absorb 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.190
 There's some resilience so we feel a bit like this when we walk 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.400
 Good to have 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.140
 Then you look at the rest of us are going to be a time c Read it please 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 The same 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.910
 I'll try to solve the problem once. It belongs to the classification by purpose of building materials. 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.190
 I said it was for non - use purposes. 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:10.110
 What is artificial material? It's different. 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.120
 The artificial materials are made of natural materials 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.900
 Differently by manufacturing sector 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 How come so easily'll classified material, the answer is once or 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 You should not be wrong. 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.210
 Now, the next thing to do is to belong to the natural sin of the festival. 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.590
 It is a natural material. 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:31.170
 Wood materials like reinforced course, now I just need to write down the withdrawal 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.980
 No , I make a withdrawal at the steelworks. 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:40.200
 That was once machined. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:44.640
 Well what melts the raw glass and pulled the oil once made this way 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.020
 Because of Korea, this will be artificial material, wood or tall. 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.020
 Write natural materials
