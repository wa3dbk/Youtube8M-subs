for<00:00:05.460> gmod<00:00:05.790> I've<00:00:06.060> been<00:00:06.420> working<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.810> these<00:00:07.020> for

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
for gmod I've been working on these for

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.919 
for gmod I've been working on these for
a<00:00:07.319> few<00:00:07.560> weeks<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.700> finally<00:00:09.360> ready<00:00:09.690> to

show them basically g3x a good friend of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.599 
show them basically g3x a good friend of
mine<00:00:17.940> threw<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> custom<00:00:19.289> server<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.890> we

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
mine threw up a custom server and we

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.269 
mine threw up a custom server and we
tested<00:00:21.000> them<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.270> multiplayer<00:00:21.710> as<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.160> can

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
tested them in multiplayer as you can

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.920 
tested them in multiplayer as you can
see<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.910> their<00:00:24.150> own<00:00:24.180> sound<00:00:24.600> effects

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
see they have their own sound effects

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.220 
see they have their own sound effects
their<00:00:25.140> own<00:00:25.260> sounds<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.920> their<00:00:26.189> own<00:00:26.310> model

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
their own sounds and their own model

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
their own sounds and their own model
this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:28.980> model<00:00:29.460> ever<00:00:29.730> created

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
this is also my first model ever created

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
this is also my first model ever created
and<00:00:30.480> basically<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:31.980> come<00:00:32.189> out

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
and basically I think it's come out

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
and basically I think it's come out
pretty<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.210> texture<00:00:33.540> needs<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.930> be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
pretty well just the texture needs to be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.950 
pretty well just the texture needs to be
revamped<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.649> bit<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.390> yeah<00:00:36.390> that's<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.780> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
revamped a bit and yeah that's about it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.180 
revamped a bit and yeah that's about it
really<00:00:37.230> there's<00:00:37.500> nothing<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> say

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
really there's nothing more to say

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.290 
really there's nothing more to say
there's<00:00:38.430> lunch<00:00:40.040> now<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.850> reason<00:00:42.030> these

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
there's lunch now the reason these

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.670 
there's lunch now the reason these
aren't<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> lounge<00:00:42.930> yet<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.530> really

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
aren't in the lounge yet there's really

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
aren't in the lounge yet there's really
three<00:00:44.219> reasons<00:00:44.610> 1<00:00:45.059> i've<00:00:45.329> sent<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> through<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
three reasons 1 i've sent it through to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440 
three reasons 1 i've sent it through to
sassafras<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.129> hasn't<00:00:47.489> had<00:00:48.059> enough<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
sassafras but he hasn't had enough to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.389 
sassafras but he hasn't had enough to
look<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> yet<00:00:49.079> reason<00:00:49.860> 2<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
look at it yet reason 2 is that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.880 
look at it yet reason 2 is that
obviously<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.000> texture<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.199> needs<00:00:52.590> work

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
obviously the texture and it needs work

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.880 
obviously the texture and it needs work
and<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.000> handle<00:00:54.449> isn't<00:00:54.870> present<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.680> yet

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and the handle isn't present as of yet

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.250 
and the handle isn't present as of yet
but<00:00:56.180> reason<00:00:57.180> 3<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.510> probably<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> main<00:00:58.230> reason

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
but reason 3 is probably the main reason

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
but reason 3 is probably the main reason
isn't<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> lounge<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> that's<00:01:00.239> because

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
isn't in the lounge and that's because

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.920 
isn't in the lounge and that's because
there's<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.620> coding<00:01:02.250> issue<00:01:02.420> well<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
there's a coding issue well more like a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
there's a coding issue well more like a
compatibility<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.070> people<00:01:05.400> who<00:01:05.519> don't

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
compatibility for people who don't

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
compatibility for people who don't
already<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> files<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.290> their<00:01:07.470> computer

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
already have the files on their computer

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
already have the files on their computer
they<00:01:08.180> cannot<00:01:09.180> use<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> slot<00:01:09.900> machines

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they cannot use the slot machines

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
they cannot use the slot machines
correctly<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.549> start<00:01:11.790> using<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.240> but

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
correctly they can start using it but

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.929 
correctly they can start using it but
when<00:01:12.570> they<00:01:12.659> attempt<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> bet<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.490> result

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
when they attempt to bet or as a result

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.289 
when they attempt to bet or as a result
quit<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.750> doesn't<00:01:16.110> work<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
quit it doesn't work at all so it's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
quit it doesn't work at all so it's
actually<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.869> hard<00:01:19.170> bug<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.740> track<00:01:20.159> down

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
actually a really hard bug to track down

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
actually a really hard bug to track down
and<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:20.670> currently<00:01:20.820> working<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> I'm

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and I'm currently working on it and I'm

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
and I'm currently working on it and I'm
not<00:01:22.530> sure<00:01:22.680> one<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.640> fixed<00:01:24.000> as

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
not sure one that's going to be fixed as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
not sure one that's going to be fixed as
if<00:01:24.270> yet

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.900 

anyway<00:01:29.110> for<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.530> people<00:01:29.830> wondering<00:01:30.220> about<00:01:30.310> NJ

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
anyway for the people wondering about NJ

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.720 
anyway for the people wondering about NJ
I've<00:01:31.540> actually<00:01:32.100> outlined<00:01:33.100> several<00:01:33.370> levels

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
I've actually outlined several levels

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.910 
I've actually outlined several levels
and<00:01:34.210> concepts<00:01:34.870> but<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.110> haven't<00:01:35.410> made<00:01:35.710> any

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and concepts but I haven't made any

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.890 
and concepts but I haven't made any
modifications<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.030> ROM<00:01:37.240> mainly<00:01:37.750> because

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
modifications to the ROM mainly because

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.930 
modifications to the ROM mainly because
I've<00:01:38.590> been<00:01:38.860> working<00:01:39.160> on<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.340> slot<00:01:39.580> machines

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
I've been working on the slot machines

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.630 
I've been working on the slot machines
but<00:01:40.120> also<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.900> takes<00:01:41.200> a<00:01:41.440> lot<00:01:41.650> of<00:01:41.680> months<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.310> of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
but also it takes a lot of months to of

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.150 
but also it takes a lot of months to of
constant<00:01:43.210> work<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.570> edit<00:01:43.930> iran<00:01:44.500> especially

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
constant work to edit iran especially

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.340 
constant work to edit iran especially
because<00:01:45.430> roms<00:01:46.090> aren't<00:01:46.480> meant<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:46.870> edited

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
because roms aren't meant to be edited

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.870 
because roms aren't meant to be edited
so<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:47.710> don't<00:01:47.920> work<00:01:48.130> correctly<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.730> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
so they don't work correctly all the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.870 
so they don't work correctly all the
time<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.300> as<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.170> result<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.670> be<00:01:51.850> a

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
time and as a result it's going to be a

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.270 
time and as a result it's going to be a
lot<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.210> work<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.570> actually<00:01:52.720> make<00:01:53.680> new<00:01:53.890> levels

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
lot of work to actually make new levels
