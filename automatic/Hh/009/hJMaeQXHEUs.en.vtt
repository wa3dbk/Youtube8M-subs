you guys I am so excited I haven't been
this<00:00:16.830> excited<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> new<00:00:17.699> call<00:00:17.910> duty<00:00:18.090> since

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this excited for a new call duty since

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.189 
this excited for a new call duty since
probably<00:00:19.350> black<00:00:19.770> ops<00:00:19.980> 1<00:00:20.420> because<00:00:21.420> i<00:00:21.630> really

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
probably black ops 1 because i really

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
probably black ops 1 because i really
think<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> advanced<00:00:23.010> warfare<00:00:23.519> has<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
think that advanced warfare has the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.759 
think that advanced warfare has the
potential<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.779> be<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> best<00:00:25.500> Call<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
potential to be one of the best Call of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890 
potential to be one of the best Call of
Duty's<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.250> only<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> think

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
Duty's not only because you know I think

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.769 
Duty's not only because you know I think
sledgehammers<00:00:28.650> doing<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> great<00:00:29.039> job<00:00:29.269> with<00:00:30.269> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
sledgehammers doing a great job with you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
call duty franchise but also there

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
call duty franchise but also there
listening<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> community<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.120> seems<00:00:36.329> like

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
from youtubers pro players people who

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560 
from youtubers pro players people who
really<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> play<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> game<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> put

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a lot of time into call duty so that's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
a lot of time into call duty so that's
definitely<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.329> thing<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> want<00:00:46.140> to

briefly mention a couple of things that
I'm<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:49.020> looking<00:00:49.140> forward<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I'm really really looking forward to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
I'm really really looking forward to
clean<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.820> advanced<00:00:51.270> warfare<00:00:51.750> i'll<00:00:51.870> probably

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
clean in advanced warfare i'll probably

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
clean in advanced warfare i'll probably
make<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:53.219> i<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.610> i'm<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
make actually i know i'm going to make a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810 
make actually i know i'm going to make a
lot<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.539> videos<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.610> get

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
lot more videos as you know we get

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.939 
lot more videos as you know we get
closer<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> closer<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> advanced<00:00:58.320> warfare<00:00:58.770> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
closer and closer to advanced warfare so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
closer and closer to advanced warfare so
definitely<00:00:59.399> keep<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.730> eye<00:00:59.879> out<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.059> those<00:01:00.420> but

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
definitely keep an eye out for those but

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
definitely keep an eye out for those but
some<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> things<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.609> I'm<00:01:02.879> really

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
some of the things that I'm really

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
some of the things that I'm really
looking<00:01:03.570> forward<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.840> obviously<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> number

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
looking forward to obviously is number

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.080 
looking forward to obviously is number

one sniping I want to see how the
mechanics<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.650> sniping<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> game<00:01:08.729> i

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
mechanics are for sniping in the game i

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.789

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hopefully we get a lot of variety and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.730 
hopefully we get a lot of variety and
sniping<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.430> far<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> one-shot<00:01:15.960> kills<00:01:16.439> our

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
sniping as far as a one-shot kills our

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
sniping as far as a one-shot kills our
one<00:01:17.490> shot<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> potential<00:01:18.900> one-shot

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
one shot you know potential one-shot

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.080 
one shot you know potential one-shot
kill<00:01:19.890> sniper<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.000> sVU's<00:01:21.920> wa<00:01:23.090> 2000s

dragunov<00:01:24.960> stuff<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.560> those<00:01:26.009> i<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
dragunov stuff like that those i really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
dragunov stuff like that those i really
do<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.790> want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> i<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.689> there's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
going to be at least one in there which

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
going to be at least one in there which
is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> waste<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> sniper<00:01:31.320> slot<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.000> far

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is a waste of a sniper slot but so far

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
is a waste of a sniper slot but so far
the<00:01:33.450> confirmed<00:01:33.840> snipers<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the confirmed snipers that we know of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.219 
the confirmed snipers that we know of
are<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> links<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.360> bolt<00:01:36.780> action<00:01:37.110> sniper

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
are the links and the bolt action sniper

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.859 
are the links and the bolt action sniper
that<00:01:37.680> pretty<00:01:37.950> much<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.090> makes<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that pretty much you know it makes it so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.140 
that pretty much you know it makes it so
you<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> magazine<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you don't have like a magazine you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.120 
you don't have like a magazine you
choose<00:01:42.390> reload<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.290> bullet<00:01:43.649> into<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
choose reload one bullet into the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
choose reload one bullet into the
chamber<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.360> how<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> keeps<00:01:45.810> going

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
chamber and that's how it keeps going

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.899 
chamber and that's how it keeps going
until<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.619> run<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.979> bullets<00:01:47.189> obviously

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
until you run out of bullets obviously

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
until you run out of bullets obviously
so<00:01:48.720> those<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.110> lonely<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.590> confirm<00:01:49.979> sniper<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so those are lonely to confirm sniper so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
so those are lonely to confirm sniper so
far<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.840> seen<00:01:52.229> gameplay

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
far we actually have not seen gameplay

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.160 
far we actually have not seen gameplay
from<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.130> links<00:01:53.430> other<00:01:53.640> than<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> brief

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
from the links other than like a brief

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
from the links other than like a brief
like<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.369> think<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.299> second

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
like I think I was like a two second

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.230 
like I think I was like a two second
clip<00:01:58.110> from<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.159> reveal<00:01:59.640> trailer

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
clip from you know the reveal trailer

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
clip from you know the reveal trailer
but<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.200> looking<00:02:01.500> forward<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.860> seeing

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
but I'm really looking forward to seeing

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.770 
but I'm really looking forward to seeing
you<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.700> how<00:02:02.880> those<00:02:03.030> other<00:02:03.180> snipers<00:02:03.570> look

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you know how those other snipers look

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
you know how those other snipers look
how<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.140> play<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> differences<00:02:05.250> are

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
how they play what the differences are

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.570 
how they play what the differences are
between<00:02:05.869> each<00:02:06.869> individual<00:02:07.469> sniper<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
between each individual sniper and the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.979 
between each individual sniper and the
second<00:02:08.970> thing<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.539> really

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
second thing that I'm actually really

second thing that I'm actually really
interested<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.340> how<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.910> develops<00:02:12.360> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
interested to see how it develops and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.760 
interested to see how it develops and
works<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
works out in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.030 
works out in
warfare<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> war<00:02:15.390> remake<00:02:15.990> momentum<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:16.950> if

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
warfare is a war remake momentum and if

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.520 
warfare is a war remake momentum and if
you<00:02:17.130> guys<00:02:17.250> never<00:02:17.550> play<00:02:17.850> war<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:19.080> world<00:02:19.320> at

you guys never play war from world at

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.850 
you guys never play war from world at
war<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.880> know<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.210> probably<00:02:21.990> considered

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
war you know it's probably considered

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.000 
war you know it's probably considered
the<00:02:22.890> best<00:02:23.250> game<00:02:23.610> type<00:02:23.910> ever<00:02:24.210> made<00:02:24.600> because<00:02:25.010> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the best game type ever made because you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
the best game type ever made because you
have<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.490> best<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.820> both<00:02:26.880> worlds<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.630> could

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
have the best of both worlds you could

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.650 
have the best of both worlds you could
get<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> lot<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.830> kills<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.760> contributes<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
get a lot of kills and it contributes to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.510 
get a lot of kills and it contributes to
you<00:02:31.080> know<00:02:31.200> potentially<00:02:31.770> winning<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.160> game<00:02:32.340> it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
you know potentially winning the game it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.280 
you know potentially winning the game it
contributes<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> objective<00:02:33.870> right<00:02:34.020> here

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
contributes to the objective right here

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
contributes to the objective right here
of<00:02:34.380> course<00:02:34.410> there's<00:02:34.830> no<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.100> else<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
of course there's no one else to get the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120 
of course there's no one else to get the
quad<00:02:36.210> feed<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:37.140> course<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.710> jumpy

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
quad feed and of course you know jumpy

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.370 
quad feed and of course you know jumpy
on<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> objective<00:02:38.940> always<00:02:39.420> helps<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
on the objective always helps out you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.630 
on the objective always helps out you
know<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.560> far<00:02:40.740> as<00:02:40.860> winning<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> game<00:02:41.400> but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
know as far as winning the game but

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.920 
know as far as winning the game but
those<00:02:41.850> are<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> two<00:02:42.240> main<00:02:42.420> things<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> I'm

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
those are the two main things that I'm

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
those are the two main things that I'm
really<00:02:43.260> looking<00:02:43.410> forward<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.070> trying<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
really looking forward to trying out in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880 
really looking forward to trying out in
advanced<00:02:45.150> warfare<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.690> sniping<00:02:46.230> first<00:02:46.710> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
advanced warfare the sniping first of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 
advanced warfare the sniping first of
all<00:02:47.010> obviously<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> way<00:02:48.840> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
all obviously you know the way of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.480 
all obviously you know the way of
sniping<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.740> advanced<00:02:50.040> warfare<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
sniping is an advanced warfare the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.000 
sniping is an advanced warfare the
mechanics<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.330> good<00:02:51.480> stuff<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.020> second

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
mechanics all that good stuff and second

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.520 
mechanics all that good stuff and second
is<00:02:53.430> momentum<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.360> war<00:02:54.600> remake<00:02:55.170> really

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
is momentum the war remake really

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.750 
is momentum the war remake really
looking<00:02:55.710> forward<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.040> playing<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.490> but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
looking forward to playing that but

looking forward to playing that but
other<00:02:57.240> than<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.870> know<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> general

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
other than that you know the general

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.380 
other than that you know the general
things<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.250> new<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.820> movement

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
things like the new of movement

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.300 
things like the new of movement
mechanics<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:01.260> advanced<00:03:01.590> warfare<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.190> going

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
mechanics for advanced warfare is going

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.620 
mechanics for advanced warfare is going
to<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.460> interesting<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.210> how<00:03:03.390> that

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
to be interesting to see how that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.590 
to be interesting to see how that
affects<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:05.130> know<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.490> traditional<00:03:06.270> call<00:03:06.510> of
