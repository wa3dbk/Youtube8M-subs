00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 the question now is the reader 's green manaus 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.099
 joÃ£o da cunha 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:15.590
 he's going to buy a boat and he wants to know if 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.590
 use diesel or gasoline engine 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.150
 leave this is a doubt 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.470
 I think 50 percent maybe 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.900
 Brazilians, right? 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.210
 the various diesel engine snacks is 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.550
 more expensive than the gasoline engine because 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.680
 is more expensive because the engine hit 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.570
 compression within the cylinder is very 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.180
 higher than the gasoline engine then 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.059
 components have to be more resilient 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.000
 more noble then engine is more expensive 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.949
 motor vehicle to have better performance 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.420
 it needs less fuel to 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.850
 generate the same power between the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.710
 yield is greater in the deviation 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.589
 then it means that the diesel engine is 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.330
 most economical diesel engine it feels 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.140
 less fuel problems 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.119
 than gasoline gasoline 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.299
 needs more building maintenance 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.979
 take over 100 you have problem of 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.990
 fuel fuel is not 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.409
 ages so often with 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.840
 gasoline with diesel engine that brings 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.330
 less problems the review is the same in the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.619
 only that in this case the review of the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420
 gasoline engine 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.899
 more often than not the engine 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 diesel you spend less in the review and 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.079
 spends much less on motor acquisition 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 a boat about 800 thousand that for 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.899
 with two engines in the range of 300 hp she 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.810
 it costs 100 thousand more 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.280
 if it is like diesel engine then the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 diesel is more expensive 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.189
 in this cost of the engine you never go 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.749
 pay the fuel for our use, right? 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.179
 of ladies per year 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.740
 will never be amortized by the difference 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.110
 of the cost of fuel 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.810
 then you will pay more in the world 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.150
 in the motorized boat reaches 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.100
 at time of sale 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.680
 the speedboat with engine reaches usually 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.710
 greater liquidity if you will spend more 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.880
 but will also sell it with 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.800
 more ease and also the better price 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.710
 since he paid more for it when 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.390
 the next meeting between the two 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:26.090
 types of motorization 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:29.209
 in practice boats of the range up to 34 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.880
 authorization feet of Sergio to veto the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.410
 trend today use the level masks 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.680
 which physical size was already larger 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.390
 predominate tease above 40 feet is 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.310
 always difficult 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.220
 you will rarely find a boat 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.570
 with two petrol engines above 40 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.910
 feet in Brazil 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.900
 now it is also important to remember that the engine 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.120
 diesel 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.090
 it usually lasts longer than one engine at a time. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 gasoline since the components are more 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.840
 the hatzius motor must be 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.930
 lasts for at least 3,000 hours on the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.110
 Petrol 2000 hours then at least 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.810
 50% more than the index varies a lot in 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.269
 the use of 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.400
 adequate and correct fuel but 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.540
 news generally hard but with motor 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.480
 gasoline 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.329
 will talk a little bit about the 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.650
 mechanical characteristics of both engine 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.450
 to gasoline 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.760
 As a general rule, it is lighter than the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.739
 dicico then this is good for the neighborhood 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.890
 You have less weight on board. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.290
 modern engines achieve their 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.099
 difference is not significant 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.049
 in addition modern engines 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.299
 withdrawal that makes 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.239
 turbochargers then the power comes 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.109
 love has a lot of touch at low speed 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.359
 this implies being able to make the boat 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.209
 quickly reach the region of the planet 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.599
 which is good, this is a characteristic of 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.730
 diesel engines and achieve more modern 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.349
 old motor saying very heavy and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.010
 really made a lot of difference in 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.189
 performance 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.169
 today the difference is not so great for 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:13.159
 same power as deviation has more 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:15.139
 torque makes up for the greater 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.579
 he has in relation to gasoline in 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.519
 performance terms 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.880
 in addition to being an engine before 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.900
 consumes less than the gasoline engine 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.330
 with a powerboat 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.770
 Diesel and u is greater than a motorboat 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.930
 with gasoline engine 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.580
 This has to be taken into account too. 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.580
 of the neighborhood purchase
