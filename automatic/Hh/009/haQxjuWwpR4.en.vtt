short program and elena khludova who was
below<00:06:00.380> her<00:06:00.849> so<00:06:01.849> that's<00:06:02.270> a<00:06:02.599> change

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
below her so that's a change

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
have now corrupt in the rankings so at

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.430 
have now corrupt in the rankings so at
the<00:06:10.130> moment<00:06:10.430> probably<00:06:10.550> Han

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
the moment probably Han

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.410 
the moment probably Han
is<00:06:12.590> there<00:06:13.100> if<00:06:13.430> she<00:06:13.640> comes<00:06:13.940> in<00:06:16.810> just<00:06:17.810> below

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
is there if she comes in just below

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.190 
is there if she comes in just below
broccoli<00:06:20.420> ham<00:06:20.660> there's<00:06:20.930> a<00:06:21.020> big<00:06:21.260> gap<00:06:21.560> there<00:06:23.200> I

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
broccoli ham there's a big gap there I

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:32.620 
broccoli ham there's a big gap there I
think<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.860> might<00:06:25.130> be<00:06:25.160> enough<00:06:30.760> 78<00:06:31.760> that's<00:06:32.420> the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
think that might be enough 78 that's the

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.230 
think that might be enough 78 that's the
best<00:06:34.300> a<00:06:35.300> mild<00:06:35.690> 140<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.880> 124<00:06:37.880> points<00:06:38.120> for<00:06:38.600> eight

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
best a mild 140 to 124 points for eight

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.850 
best a mild 140 to 124 points for eight
seconds<00:06:41.240> twenty<00:06:42.110> four<00:06:42.350> point<00:06:42.500> four<00:06:42.740> eight

what<00:06:43.190> she's<00:06:43.340> got<00:06:43.520> in<00:06:43.640> the<00:06:43.730> past<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.150> she's<00:06:44.360> done

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
what she's got in the past so she's done

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.080 
what she's got in the past so she's done
really<00:06:44.810> great<00:06:45.140> I<00:06:45.410> think<00:06:46.190> that<00:06:46.790> could<00:06:47.060> be

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
really great I think that could be

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.770 
really great I think that could be
enough<00:06:47.420> to<00:06:49.870> book<00:06:50.870> a<00:06:50.990> ticket<00:06:51.140> 100
