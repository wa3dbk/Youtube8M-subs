00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
buttons really as you can see I can zoom

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.110 
buttons really as you can see I can zoom
in<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.000> zoom<00:03:16.030> out<00:03:16.950> okay

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
in and zoom out okay

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.059 
in and zoom out okay
and<00:03:19.209> if<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.629> only<00:03:19.810> use<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.440> middle<00:03:20.650> mouse<00:03:21.040> button

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
and if I only use my middle mouse button

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.660 
and if I only use my middle mouse button
I<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:22.510> pan<00:03:23.230> around<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.950> this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
I can pan around like this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.400 
I can pan around like this
ok

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
ok

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.010 
ok
so<00:03:28.100> it's<00:03:28.340> possible<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:29.210> zoom<00:03:29.240> in<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.840> the

as rendered by blunders internal

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.850 
as rendered by blunders internal
renderer<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:48.260> this<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.770> kind<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.430> neat

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
renderer now this is kind of neat

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.090 
renderer now this is kind of neat
it's<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.550> clean<00:03:51.850> scene<00:03:52.300> isn't<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
it's a clean scene isn't it

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.410 
it's a clean scene isn't it
it's<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.520> clean<00:03:54.730> machine

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
it's a clean machine

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.170 
it's a clean machine
