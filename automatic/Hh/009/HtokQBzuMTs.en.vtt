here no matter what and to prove this is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.740 
here no matter what and to prove this is
really<00:01:51.360> unique<00:01:51.689> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:53.540> look<00:01:54.540> at

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
really unique if you go out here look at

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
really unique if you go out here look at
all<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:56.329> zeros<00:01:57.649> there's<00:01:58.649> still<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
all of these zeros there's still a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
all of these zeros there's still a
possibility<00:01:59.490> of<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:01.619> mob<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.850> able<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.360> spawn

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
possibility of a mob to be able to spawn

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.410 
possibility of a mob to be able to spawn
here<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.890> possible<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.490> only

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
here very possible but only

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.320 
here very possible but only
the<00:02:06.720> red<00:02:07.050> zeros<00:02:07.680> anything<00:02:08.430> that<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.820> just<00:02:08.970> dark

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the red zeros anything that is just dark

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
the red zeros anything that is just dark
red<00:02:09.600> no<00:02:09.930> mob<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.649> spawn<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.700> very

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
red no mob can spawn there which is very

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.740 
red no mob can spawn there which is very
very<00:02:12.180> cool

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
very cool

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.620 
very cool
