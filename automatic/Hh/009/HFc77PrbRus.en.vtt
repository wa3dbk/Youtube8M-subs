00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
I guess my generation is a little bit

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.180 
I guess my generation is a little bit
different<00:02:21.600> everyone's<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.810> into<00:02:23.290> so-called

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
that more neutral the car is better it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.430 
that more neutral the car is better it
is<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.340> faster<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:31.030> if<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> go<00:02:32.050> over<00:02:32.080> steer

 like

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.810 

so<00:04:39.170> again

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.959 

look<00:04:44.060> at<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.420> steering<00:04:45.080> input

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969

there's not one section there where I
actually<00:04:48.579> counter<00:04:49.089> correct
