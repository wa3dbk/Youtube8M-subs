 hello and welcome this new Iraqi puppet from flash facilitated dotcom 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.649
 let's create a mystery effect that you can apply any inclination a 

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.910
 character using adobe flash 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 in front of me I have a character of a chicken will create a free tutorial p 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.069
 facilitated them by dotcom 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.859
 The first thing you should do is go to the properties and change the color of the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.440
 background today in mind the black 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.280
 and well now I'm going to select all this character and how it is composed 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.670
 of many symbols let's go to modify convert symbol 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.850
 i group all these symbols into one big symbol let's name a chicken 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 and that movie is attended 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.510
 okay very well now we are here they came to new layer take the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.949
 tool the rectangle 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.180
 let's select a color linear gerardo dt very well 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.420
 then open the borders of the colors here in this little window 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.450
 and draw a rectangle 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.080
 more or less 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.370
 that since you have it selection the rectangle we go here to the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.180
 properties of the color we are going to select that go of the color black 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.810
 to a black color 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.760
 but with a few ideas 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.610
 alpha or transparency 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.030
 d plus or minus 40 then the integrated line descending from a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.720
 100 percent black dot 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.979
 to a color black d coherent percent 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.850
 very good since we have that we can go to really transformer of 20 degrees 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.700
 and they will start claviculating a little 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.050
 do you turn it if we want 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 This way 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.490
 but I think it's a little more interesting if it comes like this 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 since 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 down 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.530
 or rather the light from above 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.460
 very well 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.410
 let's turn is a little 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.840
 and depending on how 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.520
 obscure you want the effect you can claim 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.040
 more transparency 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.090
 vox let's move a bit in belgrade down this way and good 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.030
 we block the layer we're going to select the iraq chicken own 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.970
 vicente lion institution 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 let's create a property called jalkh place i think that the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.119
 a mystery effect is added 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.949
 I wanted quite well and well that's it for this guy it's very simple but it's 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.409
 the affection that you can apply in a very fast way do not forget to visit 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.269

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.199
