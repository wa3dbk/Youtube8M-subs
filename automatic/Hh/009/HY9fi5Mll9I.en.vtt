00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.320
 hello allowing us to present the postgraduate diploma in computer science that 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.309
 offers water 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.849
 bioinformatics is currently one of the most dynamic fields of science 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.119
 and with more projection 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.980
 a discipline straddling molecular biology, computer science and 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.439
 statistics that allows computers to be used to investigate biology 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.779
 of these molecules 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.409
 in diplomas we propose addresses those people who come both 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:30.880
 of the most technological area 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.760
 as in the area of ​​life sciences 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.630
 and takes into account the different interests that may arise in 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 student due to said variety of profiles 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.240
 the focus of the course is clearly practical 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.310
 and is aimed at both those who want to begin computer science or 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.390
 complement their knowledge about it as those people who have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.170
 related professional needs 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.420
 The objectives of the diploma are classified in three levels first 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.870
 We propose two leveling modules for both students 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.120
 totally alien to the area as those from the two areas that we have 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.690
 previously mentioned 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.880
 can prepare to face the subsequent modules with guarantees 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.420
 second, the theoretical and practical study of the two themes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.570
 of the current training area 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 computational genomics and structural biology 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.410
 Within this objective the student must be trained in concepts such as 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.400
 sequencing alignment genome sequencing predicting frame genes kings 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.650
 i prediction of computational structures delivered 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.170
 finally the course is marked as objective to position student in the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.930
 knowledge of the current market the computer network and its environment 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.620
 this is the knowledge of the practical performances of the different 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.230
 studied techniques 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.270
 as well as companies that are working with such methods 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.790
 the trends that are expected and laws related to the sector 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.190
 the diploma has been designed jointly with the teachers themselves 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.090
 of the course 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.010
 three of them scientific experts in the areas studied and graduate 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 and the fourth director of a company related to the pathway 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.830
 the graduate program follows the methodology 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.750
 thus prevailing constant learning through discussion forums discussions 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.720
 directed by the teacher practices recommended readings leads do it with 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.899
 tino among others 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.709
 some parts of the postgraduate course correspond didactic materials 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.139
 written while others offer digital resources 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.029
 One of the advantages of the computer pathway is that the vast majority of 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.730
 tools offered by internet 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.930
 and it is not even necessary to install a special show if you have a connection to the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.029
 net 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.119
 I just want to say goodbye to you, remember that if you are interested in 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.609
 this 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.250
 there were two graduate diplomas 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.830
 you can check the uoc website where you will find more information 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.460
 Sometimes for your attention and see you soon
