would<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.020> secondary<00:01:01.530> certainly<00:01:01.920> that's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
would be the secondary certainly that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
would be the secondary certainly that's
the<00:01:02.190> quickest<00:01:02.520> place<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.120> beat<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the quickest place you can get beat and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
the quickest place you can get beat and
you<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> cornerback<00:01:04.799> spot<00:01:05.280> you've

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
you look at the cornerback spot you've

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
you look at the cornerback spot you've
got<00:01:05.549> Deion<00:01:06.000> Belue<00:01:06.119> coming<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.780> certainly<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
got Deion Belue coming back certainly I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.280 
got Deion Belue coming back certainly I
think<00:01:07.350> he's<00:01:07.710> emerging<00:01:08.299> areas<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> top-shelf

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
think he's emerging areas a top-shelf

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
think he's emerging areas a top-shelf
corner<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:12.180> question<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.780> who's<00:01:13.020> going

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
corner now the question is who's going

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
corner now the question is who's going
to<00:01:13.439> come<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.580> spots<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.240> Geno

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to come on at the other spots and Geno

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.030 
to come on at the other spots and Geno
Smith's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> guy<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> came<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
Smith's a guy that came on down the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100 
Smith's a guy that came on down the
stretch<00:01:17.070> last<00:01:17.580> year<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> freshman<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.570> think

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
stretch last year as a freshman I think

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.679 
stretch last year as a freshman I think
certainly<00:01:19.470> he'll<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> continue<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
certainly he'll be you know continue to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.510 
certainly he'll be you know continue to
improve<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:22.830> John<00:01:23.189> Fulton

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
improve and then you look at John Fulton

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
improve and then you look at John Fulton
who<00:01:23.790> i<00:01:23.820> thought<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.210> great<00:01:24.540> game<00:01:24.780> against

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
who i thought had a great game against

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.929 
who i thought had a great game against
texas<00:01:25.470> A&amp;M<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> corner<00:01:26.280> spot<00:01:26.520> before<00:01:26.700> he

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
texas A&amp;M at the corner spot before he

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.140 
texas A&amp;M at the corner spot before he
got<00:01:27.090> hurt<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.810> turf<00:01:28.229> toe<00:01:28.470> surgery<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:29.520> he<00:01:29.579> he

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
got hurt had turf toe surgery now he he

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
got hurt had turf toe surgery now he he
seems<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.600> fully<00:01:30.930> recovered<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.619> certainly

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
seems to be fully recovered so certainly

Jeremy Shelley over the last couple of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.430 
Jeremy Shelley over the last couple of
years<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> things<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.140> he<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:37.379> done

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
years and the things that he had done

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.949 
years and the things that he had done
now<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.879> Cade<00:02:39.030> Foster<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.569> step<00:02:39.780> up

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
now it's time for Cade Foster to step up

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
now it's time for Cade Foster to step up
he's<00:02:40.140> got<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.560> leg<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:41.099> can<00:02:41.670> t<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.790> consistent

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
he's got the leg it can t be consistent

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
he's got the leg it can t be consistent
I<00:02:42.599> think<00:02:42.840> that's<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.230> question<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
I think that's the question you have the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.160 
I think that's the question you have the
freshman<00:02:44.640> Adam<00:02:44.909> Griffith<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.659> know<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:45.959> has<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
freshman Adam Griffith you know he has a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
freshman Adam Griffith you know he has a
leg<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.829> he<00:02:46.980> develop<00:02:47.400> some<00:02:47.579> consistency<00:02:48.269> but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
leg can he develop some consistency but

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.449 
leg can he develop some consistency but
I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.989> amongst<00:02:49.560> those<00:02:49.680> two<00:02:49.950> those<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.340> two

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
I think amongst those two those are two

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.680 
I think amongst those two those are two
guys<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.879> watch<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.269> terms<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
guys to watch in terms of the
