00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it's hard to believe we're surrounded by

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's hard to believe we're surrounded by
8.4<00:02:20.910> million<00:02:21.150> New<00:02:21.480> Yorkers<00:02:21.989> right<00:02:22.020> yeah<00:02:22.980> it's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
8.4 million New Yorkers right yeah it's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
8.4 million New Yorkers right yeah it's
kind<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.730> amazing<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.420> mean<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
kind of amazing I mean you know this is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.020 
kind of amazing I mean you know this is
probably<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> city<00:02:26.160> looked<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.550> 400

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
probably what the city looked like 400

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.640 
probably what the city looked like 400
years<00:02:27.180> ago<00:02:27.390> when<00:02:27.599> Henry<00:02:27.900> Hudson<00:02:28.260> sail<00:02:28.470> down

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
years ago when Henry Hudson sail down

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.960 
years ago when Henry Hudson sail down
the<00:02:28.709> river<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.520> think<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.790> would<00:02:29.910> have

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the river do you think it would have

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
the river do you think it would have
been<00:02:30.120> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.599> same<00:02:30.840> group<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.410> tree

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
been kind of the same group of tree

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.710 
been kind of the same group of tree
species<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.069> everything<00:02:32.520> yeah<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> think<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.390> I

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
species and everything yeah I think so I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.180 
species and everything yeah I think so I
mean<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.560> we've<00:02:34.770> got<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.980> lot<00:02:35.129> of

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
mean you know here we've got a lot of

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.850 
mean you know here we've got a lot of
rocky<00:02:35.489> outcropping<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.110> thin<00:02:37.349> soils

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
rocky outcropping and really thin soils

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.020 
rocky outcropping and really thin soils
and<00:02:38.099> it's<00:02:38.220> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.430> dictated<00:02:38.760> by<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and it's kind of dictated by the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
and it's kind of dictated by the
moisture<00:02:39.480> gradient<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.620> have<00:02:40.740> plants

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
moisture gradient so you have plants

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.310 
moisture gradient so you have plants
that<00:02:41.130> don't<00:02:41.430> need<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.880> lot<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> wetness<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.930> here

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
that don't need a lot of wetness so here

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.250 
that don't need a lot of wetness so here
we<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.650> chestnut<00:02:44.580> oak<00:02:44.730> which

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260

look on the city seal you'll see that
there's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.090> beaver<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:02.900> beavers<00:04:03.230> are

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
there's a beaver on it but beavers are

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.199 
there's a beaver on it but beavers are
now<00:04:03.500> extirpated<00:04:04.190> in<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> city<00:04:04.609> we<00:04:04.910> don't<00:04:05.060> have

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
now extirpated in the city we don't have

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.809 
now extirpated in the city we don't have
them<00:04:05.419> anymore<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:06.280> when<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.370> think<00:04:07.519> about<00:04:07.639> it

them anymore and when you think about it

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.000 
them anymore and when you think about it
from<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.030> plant<00:04:08.269> perspective<00:04:08.870> we've<00:04:09.500> lost<00:04:09.769> a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
from a plant perspective we've lost a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.610 
from a plant perspective we've lost a
lot<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.310> different<00:04:10.730> species<00:04:11.139> most<00:04:12.139> notably

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
lot of different species most notably

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.680 
lot of different species most notably
the<00:04:12.980> orchid<00:04:13.310> family<00:04:13.699> New<00:04:14.090> York<00:04:14.209> City<00:04:14.419> is<00:04:14.540> to

the orchid family New York City is to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.719 
the orchid family New York City is to
have<00:04:14.840> 30<00:04:15.139> species<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.680> terrestrial<00:04:16.070> orchids

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
have 30 species of terrestrial orchids

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.189 
have 30 species of terrestrial orchids
and<00:04:16.940> then<00:04:17.120> we<00:04:17.209> only<00:04:17.329> have<00:04:17.570> six<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.049> they're

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
and then we only have six and they're

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.729 
and then we only have six and they're
all<00:04:18.320> doing<00:04:18.560> really<00:04:18.829> poorly<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.970> yet<00:04:20.209> we<00:04:20.449> have

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
all doing really poorly but yet we have

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.290 
all doing really poorly but yet we have
intact<00:04:21.739> natural<00:04:22.280> communities<00:04:22.669> like<00:04:22.849> this<00:04:23.030> in

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
intact natural communities like this in

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.670 
intact natural communities like this in
the<00:04:23.419> heart<00:04:23.599> of<00:04:23.720> one<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.110> biggest<00:04:24.289> urban

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
the heart of one of the biggest urban

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.810 
the heart of one of the biggest urban

absolutely<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.930> really<00:04:27.199> special<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.740> have

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
absolutely it's really special to have

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.800 
absolutely it's really special to have
it<00:04:28.039> here<00:04:28.220> today<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.060> New<00:04:29.389> York<00:04:29.419> City<00:04:29.570> is

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
it here today because New York City is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.379 
it here today because New York City is
so<00:04:30.169> urbanized<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.010> these<00:04:31.280> pockets<00:04:31.849> of<00:04:32.000> nature

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
so urbanized and these pockets of nature

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.480 
so urbanized and these pockets of nature
support<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> ecological<00:04:33.620> processes<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.370> we

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
support the ecological processes that we

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.399 
support the ecological processes that we
need<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.880> survive<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.419> cities<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.260> number

meets the Harlem River we encountered

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.660 
meets the Harlem River we encountered
one<00:04:47.940> final<00:04:48.630> botanical<00:04:49.320> treasure<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:50.340> last

one final botanical treasure the last

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.760 
one final botanical treasure the last
remaining<00:04:51.150> patch<00:04:51.510> of<00:04:51.810> native<00:04:52.230> salt<00:04:52.530> marsh

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
remaining patch of native salt marsh

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.670 
remaining patch of native salt marsh
habitat<00:04:53.010> in<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.790> Big<00:04:54.180> Apple<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:55.140> section<00:04:55.590> of

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
habitat in the Big Apple this section of

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.710 
habitat in the Big Apple this section of
the<00:04:55.710> Harlem<00:04:56.040> River<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.490> title<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.540> have<00:04:57.690> a

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
the Harlem River is title so you have a

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.010 
the Harlem River is title so you have a
mix<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.170> freshwater<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.770> salt<00:04:59.220> water<00:04:59.640> and<00:05:00.090> it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
mix of freshwater and salt water and it

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.990 
mix of freshwater and salt water and it
innovates<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.710> plants<00:05:02.070> twice<00:05:02.340> daily<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:02.850> you

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
innovates the plants twice daily so you

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.610 
innovates the plants twice daily so you
get<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.150> really<00:05:03.330> interesting<00:05:03.660> mix<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.170> species

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
get a really interesting mix of species

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.240 
get a really interesting mix of species
here<00:05:04.920> huh<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:06.120> this<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.170> special<00:05:07.740> place<00:05:07.890> and

you must feel like there's other reasons
beyond<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:16.140> save<00:05:16.410> natural<00:05:16.830> places<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.580> a

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
beyond that to save natural places in a

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.120 
beyond that to save natural places in a
city<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:18.030> this<00:05:18.270> sure<00:05:18.690> well<00:05:19.110> obviously<00:05:19.500> I

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
city like this sure well obviously I

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.890 
city like this sure well obviously I
really<00:05:20.490> care<00:05:20.820> about<00:05:20.850> plants<00:05:21.480> being<00:05:21.660> an<00:05:21.780> urban

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
really care about plants being an urban

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.050 
really care about plants being an urban
botanist<00:05:22.530> yeah<00:05:22.800> but<00:05:23.190> these<00:05:23.310> places<00:05:23.610> are<00:05:23.910> so

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
botanist yeah but these places are so

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.430 
botanist yeah but these places are so
special<00:05:24.450> because<00:05:24.750> they've<00:05:24.990> been<00:05:25.200> here

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
special because they've been here

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.080 
special because they've been here
forever<00:05:25.710> like<00:05:26.310> since<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.700> glaciers

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
forever like since the glaciers

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.910 
forever like since the glaciers
retreated<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.780> despite<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.350> city's<00:05:28.620> best

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
retreated and despite the city's best

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.400 
retreated and despite the city's best
efforts<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.520> smother<00:05:29.850> them<00:05:30.120> out<00:05:30.270> they<00:05:30.990> survive

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
efforts to smother them out they survive

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.010 
efforts to smother them out they survive
and<00:05:31.740> they<00:05:31.890> thrive<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.610> not<00:05:33.420> only<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.720> but

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
and they thrive and not only that but

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.630 
and they thrive and not only that but
they<00:05:34.140> also<00:05:34.290> support<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.860> biodiversity<00:05:35.250> that

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
they also support the biodiversity that

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.940 
they also support the biodiversity that
lives<00:05:35.970> here<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.870> Warblers<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.680> very

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
lives here the the Warblers and the very

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.230 
lives here the the Warblers and the very
