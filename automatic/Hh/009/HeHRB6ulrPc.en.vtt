00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.200 

the<00:00:23.070> instructions<00:00:23.580> say<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> lift

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the instructions say that the lift

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.009 
the instructions say that the lift
should<00:00:24.390> only<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.750> about<00:00:24.869> 8<00:00:25.170> hours<00:00:25.590> takes<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
should only take about 8 hours takes a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.859 
should only take about 8 hours takes a
good<00:00:28.369> with<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.519> people<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.150> got<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> done<00:00:30.840> in

good with two people we got it done in
about<00:00:31.080> 15<00:00:31.679> hours<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.399> I'd<00:00:32.550> say<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> they're

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
about 15 hours so I'd say that they're

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.330 
about 15 hours so I'd say that they're
way<00:00:33.239> off<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.719> estimate

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
