found that this particular clamp is

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.610 
found that this particular clamp is
about<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.649> best<00:00:31.720> pop<00:00:32.720> up<00:00:32.899> in<00:00:33.050> those<00:00:33.170> batteries

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
about the best pop up in those batteries

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.600 
about the best pop up in those batteries
we're<00:00:34.370> also<00:00:34.579> going<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.850> be<00:00:35.000> adding<00:00:35.590> this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
we're also going to be adding this

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.470 
we're also going to be adding this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:14.319 
9-volt snap connector on the top first
we'll<00:00:55.520> take<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.440> flashlight<00:00:57.440> apart<00:01:12.999> and<00:01:13.999> take

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
we'll take the flashlight apart and take

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.249 
we'll take the flashlight apart and take
out<00:01:14.569> the<00:01:15.670> six<00:01:16.670> volt<00:01:16.939> battery

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.349 

now<00:01:21.369> we<00:01:22.369> noticed<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.939> flashlight

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
now we noticed that the flashlight

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.999 
now we noticed that the flashlight
didn't<00:01:23.569> work<00:01:23.719> very<00:01:23.990> well<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:24.530> figured<00:01:24.889> that

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
didn't work very well so we figured that

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.629 
didn't work very well so we figured that
this<00:01:25.130> battery<00:01:25.429> must<00:01:26.359> be<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.539> little<00:01:26.780> weak<00:01:27.639> what

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
this battery must be a little weak what

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.609 
this battery must be a little weak what
we'll<00:01:28.789> do<00:01:28.939> is<00:01:29.090> crack<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:29.509> open<00:01:29.600> like<00:01:30.259> I<00:01:30.409> said

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
we'll do is crack it open like I said

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.739 
we'll do is crack it open like I said
you<00:01:30.799> just<00:01:30.829> way<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.189> crack<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.609> open<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:32.539> with

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
you just way to crack it open this with

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:42.520 
you just way to crack it open this with
this<00:01:32.810> clamp<00:01:39.880> simply<00:01:40.880> squeeze<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.079> top<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.469> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
this clamp simply squeeze the top of the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.950 
this clamp simply squeeze the top of the
battery<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.219> clamp

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:01.800 

and<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.380> will<00:01:51.469> come<00:01:51.680> up

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.170 

usually<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:02.960> enough<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.440> break<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.910> glue

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
usually this is enough to break the glue

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:28.630 
usually this is enough to break the glue
plastic<00:02:05.960> seal<00:02:06.200> around<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.920> lid<00:02:25.600> well<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:27.640> see

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
plastic seal around the lid well I see

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.850 
plastic seal around the lid well I see
now<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.850> wasn't<00:02:29.300> working<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:30.380> battery<00:02:30.800> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
now I wasn't working this battery is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.540 
now I wasn't working this battery is
empty<00:02:33.040> uh-oh<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:35.060> already<00:02:35.330> been<00:02:35.510> modified
