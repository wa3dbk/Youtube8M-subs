00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
carbon steel makes the boot boscoes very
durable<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.580> can<00:02:09.610> also<00:02:09.880> make<00:02:10.150> them<00:02:10.210> very<00:02:10.360> thin

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
durable you can also make them very thin

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
durable you can also make them very thin
because<00:02:10.960> they're<00:02:11.170> higher<00:02:11.440> strength<00:02:11.890> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
because they're higher strength and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.190 
because they're higher strength and
because<00:02:12.970> they<00:02:13.120> are<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.780> also<00:02:13.930> makes

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
because they are so then it also makes

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.340

adjustable<00:02:17.740> which<00:02:18.070> means<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.610> spin<00:02:18.850> them

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
adjustable which means we can spin them

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.630

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
those imperfections in the snow so it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.510 
those imperfections in the snow so it
doesn't<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.680> transmitted<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.280> your<00:03:15.370> whole

body it also features an ABS soul here
as<00:03:19.989> well<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.770> little<00:03:20.890> bit<00:03:21.010> grittier

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
as well so it's a little bit grittier

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.630 
as well so it's a little bit grittier
material<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.080> bottom<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.130> makes<00:03:24.520> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
material on the bottom so it makes the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.010 
material on the bottom so it makes the
