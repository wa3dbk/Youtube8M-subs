thus<00:00:17.640> amplifier<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> hybrid<00:00:18.480> amp<00:00:18.870> meaning

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
thus amplifier is a hybrid amp meaning

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.900 
thus amplifier is a hybrid amp meaning
that<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.440> has<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.620> solid-state<00:00:20.280> front<00:00:20.610> end<00:00:20.789> but

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that it has a solid-state front end but

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.820

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
back it off a little bit gets nice and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
back it off a little bit gets nice and
clean<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.680> it's<00:00:31.800> very<00:00:31.980> touch<00:00:32.279> sensitive<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
clean but it's very touch sensitive to

clean but it's very touch sensitive to
my<00:00:33.059> pit<00:00:33.270> control<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:42.230> just<00:00:43.230> increase<00:00:43.589> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
my pit control so just increase that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.169 
my pit control so just increase that
volume<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.460> I'll<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.909> a<00:00:44.940> little

volume a little bit I'll get a little
more<00:00:45.329> grit<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.589> they<00:00:46.739> had<00:00:46.829> Vox<00:00:47.070> Brown<00:00:47.489> sound<00:00:47.909> in

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
more grit if they had Vox Brown sound in

backing<00:00:56.750> off<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.020> volume<00:00:57.230> cleans<00:00:57.650> it<00:00:57.800> up<00:00:57.890> very

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
backing off the volume cleans it up very

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:24.210

nice

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
now if I go over to channel 2 I can

now if I go over to channel 2 I can
access<00:01:27.979> OD<00:01:28.400> 1<00:01:28.610> or<00:01:28.850> OD<00:01:29.360> -<00:01:29.600> here's<00:01:30.170> OD<00:01:30.560> 1

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
if I want even more gain I can kick on
