00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.890 
that's very much easier with the foil
and<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.560> squish<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.069> into<00:03:38.400> any<00:03:39.000> shape<00:03:39.690> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
and you can squish it into any shape you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.830 
and you can squish it into any shape you
like<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.440> will<00:03:41.100> just<00:03:41.430> go<00:03:41.639> for<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.940> simple<00:03:42.359> round

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
like I will just go for the simple round

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
like I will just go for the simple round
shape<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:44.540> most<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.140> onigiri<00:03:46.409> are<00:03:46.980> trying

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
shape but most of the onigiri are trying

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.910 
shape but most of the onigiri are trying
but<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.080> can't<00:03:49.410> make<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:50.989> good<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.319> triangle

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
but I can't make that good of a triangle

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
but I can't make that good of a triangle
