okay<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.530> first<00:00:56.740> two<00:00:57.220> times<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.240> did<00:00:58.390> it

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
okay so the first two times I did it

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.240 
okay so the first two times I did it
without<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:59.260> slab<00:00:59.500> then<00:00:59.710> that's<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.950> second

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
without the slab then that's the second

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.370 
without the slab then that's the second
two<00:01:00.340> times<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.730> did<00:01:00.880> it<00:01:00.940> with<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:01.150> slide<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.690> also

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
two times I did it with the slide I also

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.020 
two times I did it with the slide I also
changed<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.100> e7<00:01:04.089> voicing<00:01:05.520> okay<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.580> let's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
changed the e7 voicing okay so let's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.250 
changed the e7 voicing okay so let's
have<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.210> quick<00:01:07.360> look<00:01:07.390> at<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.900> strumming

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
have a quick look at that the strumming

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.350 
have a quick look at that the strumming
pattern<00:01:08.820> we're<00:01:09.820> going<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> break<00:01:10.120> it<00:01:10.270> down

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.940 
pattern we're going to break it down
into<00:01:12.240> quavers<00:01:13.240> right<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:16.800> we're<00:01:17.800> going<00:01:17.890> to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
into quavers right so we're going to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
into quavers right so we're going to
start<00:01:18.190> with<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.630> thumb<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:21.430> gold<00:01:22.090> pin<00:01:22.300> there

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
start with a thumb and a gold pin there

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.109 
start with a thumb and a gold pin there
and<00:01:23.770> I'll<00:01:23.890> explain<00:01:24.190> that<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.610> again

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
and I'll explain that to you again

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.240 
and I'll explain that to you again
then<00:01:25.780> we're<00:01:25.930> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.140> do<00:01:26.259> eye<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.020> down

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
then we're going to do eye up and down

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.850 
then we're going to do eye up and down
with<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.369> finger<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.150> then<00:01:32.110> P<00:01:32.410> we're<00:01:32.740> going

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.060 
with the I finger and then P we're going
to<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.040> up<00:01:34.050> I'm<00:01:35.050> going<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.290> do<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.530> slack<00:01:35.800> there

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
to go up I'm going to do the slack there

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.310

patterns in this concept I said just in

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:30.380 
patterns in this concept I said just in
