00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.750
 welcome to this video tutorial from 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.610
 the virtual technologies line in 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.050
 technopark in 9 Bogota 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.689
 in this tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.779
 organize graphics in photoshop for your 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.890
 later animation in after effects what 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.169
 first we will have to have in 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.550
 account when building a large 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.760
 wealth 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.730
 is the output dimensions 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.100
 I have an image with resolution of 1280 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.030
 x 800 pixels at 72 dpi for a 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.070
 mobile device 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 once we have our graph and the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 We have built with the dimensions 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 correct we have to take into account 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 what are we going to encourage in this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.060
 case what we are going to encourage is the water 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.680
 let's animate a layer of water 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.570
 well for that we have to have in 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.100
 account the organization of the layers that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.750
 is what we're going to have to do in 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.490
 tell how we are going to organize the layers 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.400
 and how our layers are anchored 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.370
 so that the animator is clear about what is 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.300
 what he should do at this moment my 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.580
 file has several layers that are not going 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.830
 to use in animation then you are 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.000
 layers I'm going to eliminate the form 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.159
 remove layers is simply 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 selecting them and taking them to 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 the trash can 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 then we eliminate the layers that do not 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.300
 I need 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 they are two layers of water 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.970
 I'm going to eliminate one of the two 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 that is in that motive 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.320
 call me that the water list in this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.040
 moment the name that has the layer 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.180
 escape 5 I must change it I must give you the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.500
 target name at that time the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.500
 moment of the name is water 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.610
 and I also have an island layer that is 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.680
 a group 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.440
 this two layer shape then I should 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.810
 collapse the collapse laden is to bring the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.340
 layers and leave a single then this what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.730
 I can do two clicks 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.730
 straight 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.230
 combine group 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.290
 or the other is giving you control in this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640
 moment I have the layer of the island the layer 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.800
 of the palm tree then what I'm going to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.920
 to do is sneak into both cameras the 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.760
 select and with control in the queues in 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.189
 a single layer 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.840
 then in this way today cleaning the 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.909
 file and leaving only the layers 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.439
 what do I need to send them to perfect if 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.870
 I do not put to sink the person who goes 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.310
 also animate pass with the cloud layer 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.519
 in the foundation the night coat is 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.599
 formed by two graphics by two layers 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.650
 then he simply selected the group 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.540
 control in the queues 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.640
 that way only the layers 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.989
 necessary for the fund is not being 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 ross at that moment nothing I can 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.470
 eliminate it 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.000
 at this time then I have the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.599
 layers that are the sky is not the coral 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.599
 Sun 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.810
 on the island and water what to have in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.090
 mind that the water that layer I'm going to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.570
 animate moves and moves as 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.570
 I'm going to do 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.000
 in this way 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.540
 well at this moment I realize that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 the water is cut if you move it if the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.950
 moves is going to do to make 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.140
 this then what is optimizing the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.240
 picture to be served on the phone 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.710
 how i 'm going to do that 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.980
 The first thing I'm going to do is save 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.150
 that file that is already clean 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.150
 I'm just going to save 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.760
 as a losing stage 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 this at this time the water layer does not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.990
 is useful to me in animation then I'm going to 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.760
 create a new file taking in 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.860
 count the dimensions that I have here 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.860
 then new file 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:06.460
 then I will create taking into account 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:09.600
 the dimensions are 1280 x 800 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.600
 to 72 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.019
 from pain 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.630
 how I want to make the water move 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.270
 I need the water graph to have 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.880
 twice as wide then I'm going to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:31.620
 modify the width to double then 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.620
 I'm going to leave 2560 pixels wide 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.400
 that I already have a new file 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.210
 to show you here 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.790
 in the documents so they can see 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.800
 what to do with water 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.170
 I'm going to take the water layer to my 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.900
 incoming documentary simply 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.490
 they select and dig water and we take it to 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.479
 my account 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.479
 to my document 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.250
 and I'm going to put it in one of the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.949
 water corners I need to explain it here 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.529
 so that the sinusoidal wave left me 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.409
 complete 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.299
 and what I'm going to do is double it to 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.689
 this I will use the alt key and 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:15.689
 reason 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.560
 Christ 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.560
 that way I have two layers for water 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.250
 I already have the water graph 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.949
 build I'm going to delete the file from 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.259
 background because this file is not it is not me 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.699
 useful when it leads to after effects and 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.440
 the same to give you the clean file 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.940
 I'll just give controlling entity 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.639
 control 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.040
 I'm going to give him controls to sneak 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.800
 before simply to collapse control 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.860
 ready 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.390
 it was filed out of water I'm not going to save it 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.330
 if there was, you are like 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.570
 in it the same folder in it 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.360
 directory and I'll just put it 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.480
 Water 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.950
 that is not 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.340
 save 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.150
 okay 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.590
 ready in this moment we have finished already 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.260
 to build the files and organize them 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.240
 to carry the three then what 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.630
 I have is the following this file that 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.640
 it's my original file 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.460
 this file that is the clean file 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.360
 where I have the is the stage and a 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.360
 file with water 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.479
 in the next tutorial we will see how 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.560
 import the layers in after effects for 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.560
 proceed to cheer him up
