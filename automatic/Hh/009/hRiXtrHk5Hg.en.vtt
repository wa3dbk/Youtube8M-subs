hot<00:01:31.920> oil<00:01:32.540> okay

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
hot oil okay

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
hot oil okay
our<00:01:33.840> oil<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.170> cooled<00:01:34.380> down<00:01:34.470> we've<00:01:35.100> been<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
our oil is cooled down we've been to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
our oil is cooled down we've been to
going<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:35.939> 30<00:01:36.270> minutes<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
going about 30 minutes I think I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
going about 30 minutes I think I
actually<00:01:37.740> went<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.159> longer<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.820> okay

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
actually went a little longer it's okay

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.090 
actually went a little longer it's okay
I<00:01:39.299> wanna<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.140> gonna<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> fork<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I wanna do just gonna take a fork and I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
I wanna do just gonna take a fork and I
want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> roughly<00:01:41.759> strain<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
want to roughly strain this if you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.139 
want to roughly strain this if you
really<00:01:43.170> wanted<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> try<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> lengthen<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
really wanted to try to lengthen and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.240 
really wanted to try to lengthen and
preserve<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.720> life<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> oil<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.100> run

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
preserve the life of the oil you can run

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
preserve the life of the oil you can run
it<00:01:47.310> through<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> coffee<00:01:47.700> filter<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:48.869> gonna

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it through a coffee filter but I'm gonna

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960 
it through a coffee filter but I'm gonna
use<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.890> relatively<00:01:50.490> short<00:01:50.700> period

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
use this up in a relatively short period

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.170 
use this up in a relatively short period
of<00:01:51.240> time<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> I'm<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.430> gonna<00:01:53.549> use<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> for

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
of time so I'm just gonna use the for

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.200 
of time so I'm just gonna use the for
keep<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> chunks<00:01:55.320> out<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:56.180> right<00:01:57.180> now

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
keep the chunks out of it right now

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
keep the chunks out of it right now
remember<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> those<00:01:58.290> little<00:01:58.500> bitty<00:01:58.710> bits

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
remember that those little bitty bits

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
remember that those little bitty bits
and<00:01:59.369> pieces<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.820> why<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.899> last

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and pieces are why this will not last

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
and pieces are why this will not last
very<00:02:01.320> long

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.210 

yeah<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.140> valuable<00:02:08.440> still<00:02:08.769> I<00:02:08.890> wanna<00:02:09.069> get
