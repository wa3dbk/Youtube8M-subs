00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
so their front seven maybe a little more

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.900 
so their front seven maybe a little more
depth<00:02:26.410> yeah<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.769> have<00:02:26.890> my<00:02:27.280> back<00:02:27.489> yard<00:02:27.670> work

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
depth yeah you have my back yard work

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.910 
depth yeah you have my back yard work
but<00:02:28.239> for<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.780> most<00:02:28.959> part<00:02:29.110> they're<00:02:29.680> pretty

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
but for the most part they're pretty

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.650 
but for the most part they're pretty
legit<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.340> front<00:02:30.549> seven<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.090> at<00:02:31.480> wide

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
legit on the front seven and at wide

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.240 
legit on the front seven and at wide
receiver<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.170> quarterback<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.799> course<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
receiver and quarterback of course and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
receiver and quarterback of course and
running<00:02:33.579> back<00:02:33.760> run<00:02:34.090> back<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.420> show<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.720> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
that weapon there but for the most part

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.400 
that weapon there but for the most part
there's<00:03:59.640> some<00:03:59.820> rights<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.329> all<00:04:00.480> right<00:04:00.780> it's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
there's some rights of all right it's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.170 
there's some rights of all right it's
pretty<00:04:01.739> clear<00:04:01.829> what<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.489> Packers<00:04:02.730> knee<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180

doubt<00:04:03.630> Kampmann<00:04:04.079> comes<00:04:04.260> back<00:04:04.500> though<00:04:04.709> because

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
doubt Kampmann comes back though because

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.240 
doubt Kampmann comes back though because
he<00:04:05.340> wants<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.820> play<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.750> end<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.260> 4-3<00:04:07.799> right

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
he wants to play the end and a 4-3 right

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.220
