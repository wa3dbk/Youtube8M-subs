00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
satisfied with the outcome I used it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
thought I would jump in a little bit

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.960 
thought I would jump in a little bit
more<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.530> digital<00:00:52.040> media<00:00:52.190> because<00:00:52.670> the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
more to the digital media because the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.630 
more to the digital media because the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
about then that somebody introduced me

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.560
