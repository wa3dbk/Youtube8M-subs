00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
GTA and I randomly saw someone riding

around<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> couch<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.859> pretty<00:00:32.189> crazy<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
around in the couch it's pretty crazy so

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
around in the couch it's pretty crazy so
i<00:00:32.759> thought<00:00:33.000> i'd<00:00:33.149> share<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
i thought i'd share this with all of you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
i thought i'd share this with all of you
but<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> mod<00:00:34.770> itself<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.430> created<00:00:35.670> by<00:00:36.059> ECB

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but the mod itself was created by ECB

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
but the mod itself was created by ECB
too<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:37.950> surprised<00:00:38.399> he<00:00:38.550> came

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
too and I'm not really surprised he came

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
too and I'm not really surprised he came
out<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.719> he's<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
out with this because he's just a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
out with this because he's just a
monster<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> comes<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> these<00:00:41.850> things

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
