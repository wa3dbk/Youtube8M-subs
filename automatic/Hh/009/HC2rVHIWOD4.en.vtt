00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.169
 the numbers around us we see them in 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.400
 all the sites are part of our 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.559
 lifetime 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.160
 of course the numbers represent 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.119
 many things for us as adults 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 but what do they mean for a small child 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.460
 they really have meaning or they are just 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460
 numbers 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.550
 the numbers do not physically exist in 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.939
 no place but people are 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.710
 refer to them as if this existed 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.480
 it's because they have become objects 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
 so familiar to most of 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.470
 the people that parents for example 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.019
 when talking with their children they refer to 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.440
 them as if indeed the numbers 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.870
 were tangible so we say look there's a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.629
 one on that bus although actually what 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.699
 only we see is a figure we do not see the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.530
 number itself and this is very confusing to 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.180
 the child precisely because he is 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.270
 with this kind of situations at a very old age 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 early 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 the numbers become real look at it well 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.140
 you have to look at it well 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 noomi with uses a sequence of 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.120
 forms that offer a visual image of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.979
 the numbers what helps the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.210
 children to explore and build their 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.729
 mathematical understanding 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.770
 the multisensory approach of nummi with 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.799
 focused on oral and mental work 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.799
 inspires children to think 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.799
 mathematically 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 an icon only converts the numbers in 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.910
 something real for children in the sense 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 that they can see and touch them but that 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.700
 also presents the relationships 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 mathematics extremely 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 clear because they can appreciate with 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 clarity that each number is greater than 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.659
 previous thanks to the pattern system 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.479
 used 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.710
 what number is this correct is 4 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.599
 we continue counting dylan 12 plus the pattern 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.250
 and the relationships between numbers is a 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.890
 good way to make people understand 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.110
 children the concept of number helps us 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 understand your place value and how 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.489
 fit with each other besides the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.440
 relationship between them in the line of 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.080
 numbers all through the pattern 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.970
 children enjoy working with noomi 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.450
 with because it appeals to your ability to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.670
 set patterns 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.980
 helps us see how the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.340
 numbers giving them the confidence to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.340
 persevere 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 thanks to the confidence acquired his 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.300
 understanding is deeper and its level 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.790
 of personal achievement is greater 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.160
 they like to manipulate shapes and play 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.380
 with them in plasticine in water in sand 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
 for them it is really part of their 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.310
 daily experience and when the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.350
 moment to use it as a resource of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.240
 teaching are already very familiar 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.090
 with the forms and they have a lot of confidence 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.000
 in its handling is not something abstract is 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.440
 something real that they can use and with what 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 that create connections 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.430
 work with noomi with cheers for children 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.010
 to reason think logically and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.640
 systematic in applying his understanding of 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.430
 very different ways 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.349
 after searching my number for 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.269
 and because the children show that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.489
 they understand the concept with their actions 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.940
 noomi with help also to teachers 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.310
 to see his mental process 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.260
 with numbers is difficult really is all 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.450
 an assumption unless you can see what 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.190
 what they do and how they draw conclusions is 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.990
 a way to see how their 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.400
 minds and what they are able to apply and 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.400
 connect these new knowledge 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.510
 the approach and I do not lend myself a 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.819
 great variety of situations in the classroom 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.519
 and can be used at all levels of 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.599
 exploitation not me with is a resource 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.599
 for all children 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.900
 good one of the most exciting aspects 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.060
 of the unicom is that its use is not restricted 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.280
 to small children who are beginning to 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.380
 work with the concept of number there 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.570
 many resolution activities 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.900
 problems that can be posed to children 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.850
 of any skill level even 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.949
 the most advanced and stimulates them to 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.880
 think mathematically to solve 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.880
 the challenge that arises 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:46.009
 that is look at it well in the case of children 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.199
 more delayed with respect to their 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.849
 colleagues and maybe in need of 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.559
 personalized attention there 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.390
 investigations that show that in 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:57.790
 Only brand the difference comes in handy 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.400
 of the children who have made the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.200
 program of which we have all data 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.600
 they progressed and 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.900
 some of them exceptionally 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.150
 much more than we thought about 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.820
 example a child who got only nine 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.360
 points got more than 40 in a period 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.670
 10 weeks is admirable is not like that with 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.980
 all children if a child leaves from 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.690
 a very low level has much more road 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.440
 to go but the important thing is that 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.440
 they were improving 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.069
 I do not offer with various types of support 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.159
 to the assistant teachers of 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.349
 teachers and parents sessions 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.269
 of training are very useful at the beginning 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.519
 to use the method while the 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:46.499
 materials for the teacher offer to 

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:48.119
 teachers the necessary resources 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:51.779
 to expand your knowledge of 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:53.489
 matter using an icon with security the 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.009
 activity cards propose many 

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:57.869
 interesting ideas for the classroom at the same time 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.129
 that help the teacher to plan the 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:04.469
 classes I think that in multiplication in 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:08.699
 particular can be very difficult 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:11.399
 determine the different steps and by 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.579
 he used the chips because they separate 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:17.429
 clearly the different parts of the 

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:19.469
 process when doing the activities in 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:21.419
 person the teachers start to 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.459
 appreciate the mathematical challenges to which 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.439
 children face and appreciate 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:28.070
 also the great contribution that I do not 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.530
 with can you have on your success 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.540
 outside the classroom the support team num and 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.400
 With is available to offer 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.690
 Tips on the product and 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.310
 professional development opportunities 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.840
 known the number of participants in the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.300
 training 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.610
 and with the growing community I do not get 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.669
 on the internet are the latest 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.530
 information ideas and resources what 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:55.510
 contributes to making the 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.510
 experience of working with noomi with 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.630
 thanks to the unique capacity of 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.410
 turn numbers into reality in 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:13.320
 the sense that these can be seen and 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.300
 touching is shown that children 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.150
 acquire greater security in what 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.850
 do with a single I feel much more 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.280
 creative as a teacher and I hope to be a 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.410
 little more interesting for the student that 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.660
 before and be more focused on what 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.580
 I teach he noticed that children are more 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.900
 Concentrated and aware of the steps 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.960
 what they give and what they should do 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.780
 continuation or jim me it would be very very 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.690
 difficult to teach without um and with what it gives 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.000
 idea of ​​the importance it has for me 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.000
 you can do so many visual things 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.570
 with the method that would be crazy not 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.570
 do what
