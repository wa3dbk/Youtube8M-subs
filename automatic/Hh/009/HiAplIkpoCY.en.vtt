material<00:00:05.730> solid<00:00:06.600> surface<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.490> typically<00:00:08.490> a

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
material solid surface is typically a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.379 
material solid surface is typically a
polyester<00:00:09.330> or<00:00:09.809> acrylic<00:00:10.469> plastic<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:12.150> it's

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
polyester or acrylic plastic and it's

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.839 
polyester or acrylic plastic and it's
very<00:00:12.599> durable<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.950> resist<00:00:14.280> many<00:00:14.549> things

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
very durable and can resist many things

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.750 
very durable and can resist many things
but<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.179> will<00:00:15.360> scratch<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.619> occasion<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.550> off

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
but it will scratch on occasion this off

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.490 
but it will scratch on occasion this off
I've<00:00:18.119> picked<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> piece<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.050> very<00:00:19.289> dark

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
material here so they would highlight

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.540 
material here so they would highlight
the<00:00:21.630> scraps<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.050> little<00:00:22.260> bit<00:00:22.410> better<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.369> what

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
effect what we do here so if we take the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.479 
effect what we do here so if we take the
box<00:00:36.149> blade<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.559> scratch<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.460> see

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
box blade and we scratch this you'll see

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270 
box blade and we scratch this you'll see
that<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.329> plastic<00:00:40.010> virtually<00:00:41.010> everything

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that all plastic virtually everything

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
that all plastic virtually everything
that<00:00:41.430> scratches<00:00:42.059> scratches<00:00:42.540> white<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that scratches scratches white and so I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
that scratches scratches white and so I
was<00:00:43.829> home<00:00:44.010> using<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> piece<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> dark<00:00:44.879> material

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
was home using a piece of dark material

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
was home using a piece of dark material
to<00:00:45.600> give<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.140> contrast<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.270> I'll

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to give a good contrast so so I'll

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
to give a good contrast so so I'll
scratch<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> box<00:00:49.260> blade<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.770> will

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
scratch this with a box blade that will

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.389 
scratch this with a box blade that will
repair<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> using<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.860> six-inch<00:00:52.860> orbital

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
repair it using a six-inch orbital

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
repair it using a six-inch orbital
sander<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.360> grits<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.079> sandpaper<00:00:55.559> I'll

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
sander and then grits of sandpaper I'll

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.599 
sander and then grits of sandpaper I'll
uses<00:00:57.530> 81-83<00:00:59.210> 20<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> 500<00:01:01.770> cloth<00:01:02.100> or

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
uses 81-83 20 and then a 500 cloth or

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.950 
uses 81-83 20 and then a 500 cloth or

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
so first I'm going to use two a d-pad

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.880 
so first I'm going to use two a d-pad
and<00:01:17.030> I'm<00:01:17.510> gonna<00:01:17.660> do<00:01:17.870> this<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.260> real<00:01:18.470> time<00:01:18.710> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
and I'm gonna do this in real time to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
spend on something like this if we were

00:01:22.100 --> 00:02:25.449 
spend on something like this if we were
in<00:01:22.220> your<00:01:22.370> home<00:01:22.520> repairs

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.180 

as<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.640> switch<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.060> 180<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.560> trying<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> do

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
as I switch to 180 what I'm trying to do

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.550 
as I switch to 180 what I'm trying to do
as<00:02:29.430> well<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.180> sand<00:02:30.450> around<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.989> scratch<00:02:31.349> a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
as well as to sand around the scratch a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.860 
as well as to sand around the scratch a
little<00:02:31.709> bit<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.220> create<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.730> area<00:02:33.060> when<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:33.720> go

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
little bit to create an area when I go

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
little bit to create an area when I go
to<00:02:33.930> 180<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.860> sand<00:02:35.129> in<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.489> bigger<00:02:35.790> area

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
to 180 I have to sand in a bigger area

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.720 
to 180 I have to sand in a bigger area
than<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:37.230> ad<00:02:37.410> scratches<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.370> all<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
than the ad scratches to get all the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:03:09.190 
than the ad scratches to get all the
scratches<00:02:39.209> out<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:40.069> reclaim<00:02:41.069> my<00:02:41.310> finish

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.500 

once<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> scratch<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.920> taken<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.510> it's

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
once the scratch is taken out it's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.210 
once the scratch is taken out it's
really<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.020> matter<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.319> refinishing<00:03:13.830> and

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
really just a matter of refinishing and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980 
really just a matter of refinishing and
getting<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.520> finish<00:03:14.819> back<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.300> again<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:15.630> I'm

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
getting the finish back up again so I'm

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:43.210 
getting the finish back up again so I'm
on<00:03:16.140> 3:20<00:03:16.740> now

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:04:46.570 

finally

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.010 

what<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:47.729> typically<00:04:48.120> clean<00:04:48.479> with<00:04:48.750> is

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
what we typically clean with is

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.679 
what we typically clean with is
antibacterial<00:04:49.729> Windex<00:04:50.729> or<00:04:51.030> something<00:04:51.449> in<00:04:51.569> a

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
antibacterial Windex or something in a

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.320 
antibacterial Windex or something in a
bacterial<00:04:52.319> it<00:04:52.919> won't<00:04:53.129> streak<00:04:53.580> or<00:04:53.909> something

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
bacterial it won't streak or something

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.779 
bacterial it won't streak or something
so<00:04:54.479> we'll<00:04:54.629> take<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:54.960> by<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.610> treat<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.699> with

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
so we'll take that by and treat it with

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.059 
so we'll take that by and treat it with
a<00:04:56.879> little<00:04:57.030> antibacterial<00:04:57.530> Windex<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.860> wipe

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
a little antibacterial Windex to wipe

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:15.410 
a little antibacterial Windex to wipe
