00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.469
 A light year asking him pass Subway 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 a light year is a distance is not time 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.950
 one light year 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.160
 what resorts to the light that resorts to what 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.189
 that runs through the light in a year then the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.250
 light the speed of light is 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.140
 approximately 300,000 km 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.860
 second 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.860
 although you do not believe it 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.680
 you see me late but why 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.240
 portray small that does not show 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.150
 stars and that knows that you are not 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.860
 seeing the star I had the star of 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.700
 when it came out in the light of the star that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.180
 the most 10 million years ago 90 90 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.590
 years costs 92 light 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.590
 hundred thousand 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 in the time 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.110
 to the star the best exploiter already 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.110
 had to see the very small portrait 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.699
 insignificant 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 not to lose everything has to do more with 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.810
 the brain with other things but there is one 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.780
 no no no because it explodes since 90 years no 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.540
 you are wrong 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.340
 the exit light of 90 years and it arrives now 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.920
 here but the 90 years that have passed 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 may have happened things is not very 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 probable 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.689
 so 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.399
 a light year in a year a year how much 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.399
 second has a year has 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.230
 365 days for 24 hours for 3600 seconds 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.230
 who has a year 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.979
 a year ago 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.500
 how much the next rival 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.730
 31 million 536 thousand 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.080
 second 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.080
 and one kilometer 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.790
 They are 1000 meters 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.990
 then a light year was 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.950
 and if it does not have to be a year it's not what 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.110
 same as the earth 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.379
 a year a measure of time a light year to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.819
 a distance another three the distance 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.370
 that runs the something a year ago was 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 The speed of light 300,000 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.670
 kilometers match seconds for the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 seconds that has a year 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 and that gives nothing more than 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.810
 one party steel 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.810
 10 seconds 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:22.349
 9.46 08 per high to 12 meters said 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.500
 kilometers that to pass the metro it would be 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.150
 put 30 May to put 30 you know 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.250
 which adds 3 to the exponent 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:42.590
 and now let's write numbers 9 1 2 3 4 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:48.670
 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 are millions 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.670
 billions 9,460 billion meters 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.780
 there are quantities and from which 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.560
 you lose the sense is , 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 from your good 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.640
 I would still erase for the video
