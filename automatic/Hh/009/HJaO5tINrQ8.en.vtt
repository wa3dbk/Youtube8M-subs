00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.970
 nice mail with kisses hello 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.180
 syllables 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 how to make a corolla two firs 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.939
 to decorate my Christmas tree 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.430
 big kiss and then I found 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.180
 how to do 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.180
 watch the video pop pop pop 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.030
 thank you syllables I have received your 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.390
 message syllables so this little girl 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.270
 who are you asking how to achieve 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.650
 a corolla of fir trees to decorate his 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.810
 christmas tree well it took me a little bit of 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.470
 time to find but I found a 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.440
 idea there is a corolla two firs 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.300
 to make this choir is good 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.370
 it's pretty simple any tale done yes 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.290
 we had to think about it 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 and of course you need a sheet of 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.210
 paper 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.570
 we suspected a plate pencil 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.930
 and in fact just a pair of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.880
 scissors 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.320
 that's what you need for 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.479
 realize this choir two fir trees then 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.479
 I suggest you start the children 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.400
 with the tracing so a circle to 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.479
 ugly 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:45.940
 the plate as these cut out 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.940
 carefully outline 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.360
 well the circle being cut off and it does not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:59.190
 more than to fold it already in two 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:03.440
 then again in two and again 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.440
 once in two sets 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.200
 to begin you must realize both 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.770
 points which lies here at a distance 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.870
 therefore 2 cm from the end 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.410
 superior and 2 cm from the edges 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 Outside 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.019
 seeing the other two points that are 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 just below that is this time 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:44.360
 at 3 cm 5 so from above and with respect to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.739
 the central axis that I drew here 5 mm 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.739
 from either side 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:05.209
 let's now see the two points that are 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 located here so they are 5 cm from the 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:15.430
 superior base and are distant here from 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 3 or 4 mm on either side of this axis 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.970
 here 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.760
 and finally the bottom point here he's going to 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:36.650
 find 5 cm 5 so from above for 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.180
 diameter of course a plate of 18 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:46.780
 cm and the dots here at 505 mm so some 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.780
 extremities 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.760
 which will allow us now 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:04.560
 to have the hatched areas here that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 correspond to the areas that will have to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.200
 remove left here a centimeter so 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:22.800
 between the last point there and this one a 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:26.539
 centimeter here and then we could 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.539
 finish like this 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:34.400
 it's imposing to cut out so we're going 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:41.930
 start with this one is just down 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:48.090
 here and there 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:53.840
 and that's what ends the cutting of 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:56.180
 the corolla on his part that will give us 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.190
 something very pretty 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.870
 here is the corolla there is only 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:10.039
 drop on a fir tree branch for 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.039
 give batwa effect syllables 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.820
