00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.270
 now of course still ice on the sea in the mountain 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.639
 the rivers have not yet opened up but it will happen 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.500
 already very very soon when it 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.130
 happen then think about the boat will 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.980
 too late 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.369
 prepare a sleigh in the summer and a boat in the winter in folk 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.710
 wisdom 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.500
 here and cooking now is the time now 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.779
 the main conflict which rubber against pvc 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.520
 and here are my expert experts unequivocally 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.890
 solve it in favor of pvc because 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.849
 rubber defenders main argument what 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.280
 cheapness 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.770
 but pvc boats come in all sorts 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.579
 price categories in the second 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.320
 functionality reliability and durability 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.010
 this is probably what it is worth 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.750
 overpay 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.070
 take for example the popular marcus 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.989
 Mary she is represented by several 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.149
 series including relative 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.399
 budget as here for example a series of optima 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.829
 how not a series of optimal answer but except 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.120
 Affordable price first is removable 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.350
 bow awning moving seat 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.969
 non-slip polozova resistant plywood but 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
 also compactness and mobility here 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.150
 for example, this model of the series is optimal 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.770
 called sm 360 it weighs only 69 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.900
 pounds while taking on board 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.850
 six hundred and seventy kilos of cargo 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.430
 it's true along with the passengers themselves 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.890
 passengers she takes 5 but in those 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.140
 the documentation indicates 5 + 1 ie 6 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.820
 if necessary , you can also put in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.229
 in terms of strength, the series itself is optimal 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.969
 well recommended for all the money 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.009
 this strength test I propose 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.159
 consider on air models 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.290
 these are boats with inflatable are you here but what 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.030
 First of all PVC material 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.759
 pretty durable at feasts 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 the bottom is additionally taped by five 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.479
 mm polyurethane tape then 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.610
 there is maximum protection against 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.020
 mechanical damage and that too well, 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.549
 absolutely reinsure pay 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.320
 attention is on camouflage 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.420
 coloring thing is that it is not easy 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.909
 design decision boats with camouflage 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 almost 20 percent PVC color 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.259
 the expense of applying an additional layer of glue 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.030
 Well, in general, this is a series in principle 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.049
 designed for mountain fishing therefore 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.479
 of course first of all 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.880
 the manufacturer paid attention to her 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.310
 reliability and most importantly remember that in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.679
 wildlife conditions in case of breakage 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.929
 boat so no one will treat 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.640
 overpayment for pvc is not an overpayment 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.740
 it is rather an investment calm 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.570
 guarantees from no need and hassle 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.950
 more that experts are categorically not 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.600
 recommend on this case 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.060
 saving in the end is saving 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.569
 may just turn around yet 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.569
 there are cases 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.470
 all for hunting all for fishing 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.020
 everything for sport and tourism entertainment on 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.190
 water and under water and everything for active 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.440
 recreation 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.060
 all and shops gun yard the world 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.060
 adventure and sports qua
