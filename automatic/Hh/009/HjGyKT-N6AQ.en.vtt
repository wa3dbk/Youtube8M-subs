dog away for you with it throwing a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.940 
dog away for you with it throwing a
treat<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.540> call<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:47.960> desk<00:02:48.260> friend

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.930 

hearing<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> treats<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.610> good<00:02:52.730> way<00:02:52.880> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
hearing the treats a really good way to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.420 
hearing the treats a really good way to
get<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> lot<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> reverence<00:02:54.050> reps<00:02:54.620> without

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
get a lot of reverence reps without

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.550 
get a lot of reverence reps without
having<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.850> dog<00:02:56.110> therefore<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:57.200> it's<00:02:57.350> just

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
having a dog therefore if it's just

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.010 
having a dog therefore if it's just
pretty<00:02:58.130> much<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> fun<00:02:58.520> game<00:03:01.690> what's<00:03:02.690> your<00:03:02.840> dog

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
pretty much a fun game what's your dog

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.390 
pretty much a fun game what's your dog
knows<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.530> prompt<00:03:03.800> which<00:03:03.920> really<00:03:04.130> doesn't

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
knows the prompt which really doesn't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:15.059 
knows the prompt which really doesn't
take<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.850> long

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.670 

then

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
then

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.740 
then
you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.400> start<00:03:17.670> putting<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.180> into<00:03:18.329> your<00:03:18.510> plush

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you can start putting it into your plush

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:32.580 
you can start putting it into your plush
puppy<00:03:18.989> push<00:03:19.349> ups<00:03:19.590> too<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.909> say<00:03:21.150> down

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.940 

good

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.759 

get<00:03:36.550> your<00:03:36.760> dog<00:03:36.879> to<00:03:36.910> come<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.480> front<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.810> seal

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.410 

from<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.890> stationary<00:03:42.430> position<00:03:42.550> takes<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.269> while

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
from a stationary position takes a while

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.910 
from a stationary position takes a while
test<00:03:43.690> front<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.050> wouldn't<00:03:47.319> expect<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.769> in

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
test front and I wouldn't expect it in

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.290 
test front and I wouldn't expect it in
the<00:03:48.010> fur<00:03:48.190> at<00:03:48.430> first<00:03:48.700> but<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.180> good

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
the fur at first but it's a good

00:03:49.300 --> 00:04:06.110 
the fur at first but it's a good
practice<00:03:49.480> for<00:03:49.780> them

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 

to<00:04:06.659> make<00:04:06.840> sure<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.290> dog<00:04:07.440> sits<00:04:07.830> in<00:04:08.010> front

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
to make sure that the dog sits in front

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.490 
to make sure that the dog sits in front
of<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.489> when<00:04:08.640> you're<00:04:08.730> giving<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.090> reward

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
of you when you're giving the reward

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.770 
of you when you're giving the reward
they<00:04:10.500> will<00:04:10.680> probably<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.580> kind<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.480> went<00:04:12.569> over

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
they will probably I kind of went over

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.089 
they will probably I kind of went over
that<00:04:12.900> skipped<00:04:13.379> over<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.620> part<00:04:13.860> when<00:04:13.980> they

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
that skipped over that part when they

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.039 
that skipped over that part when they
were<00:04:14.370> probably<00:04:14.640> set<00:04:15.180> just<00:04:15.450> because<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
were probably set just because the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.930 
were probably set just because the
training<00:04:16.560> list<00:04:16.739> said<00:04:16.949> and<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.430> an

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
training list said and that's a an

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360 
training list said and that's a an
automatic<00:04:18.780> default<00:04:19.139> position<00:04:19.709> for<00:04:20.010> them<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
automatic default position for them and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.159 
automatic default position for them and
also<00:04:20.880> because<00:04:21.389> you're<00:04:21.510> holding<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> treat

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
also because you're holding the treat

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.939 
also because you're holding the treat
here<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:22.620> going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.800> make<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:27.949> mentally

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
here that's going to make a mentally

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:29.990 
here that's going to make a mentally
you're<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> want<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.520> able<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.820> send

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
you're going to want to be able to send

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.580 
you're going to want to be able to send
the<00:04:30.120> dog<00:04:30.270> further<00:04:30.660> away<00:04:30.870> from<00:04:31.020> you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.680 

or<00:04:34.190> just<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.520> be<00:04:34.640> further<00:04:34.880> away<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.240> can<00:04:35.540> make

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
or just to be further away you can make

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.450 
or just to be further away you can make
quite<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.960> game<00:04:36.230> out<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:36.890> know<00:04:36.980> sending<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
quite a game out of you know sending the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.250 
quite a game out of you know sending the
dog<00:04:37.640> further<00:04:38.000> away<00:04:38.180> from<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:38.870> then

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
dog further away from you and then

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:58.900 
dog further away from you and then
calling<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.680> front<00:04:39.830> desk

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.540 

so<00:04:59.910> eventually<00:05:00.810> when<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.289> have<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.500> solid<00:05:02.069> stay

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
so eventually when you have a solid stay

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.760 
so eventually when you have a solid stay
on<00:05:02.759> your<00:05:02.910> dog<00:05:03.120> but<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.960> are<00:05:04.080> also<00:05:04.259> presumably

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
on your dog but you are also presumably

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.730 
on your dog but you are also presumably
working<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:06.110> your<00:05:07.110> dog<00:05:07.819> has<00:05:08.819> learned<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
working on and your dog has learned the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.499 
working on and your dog has learned the
front<00:05:10.740> then<00:05:11.250> you're<00:05:11.490> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.639> be<00:05:11.759> able<00:05:11.789> to

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
front then you're going to be able to

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:24.920 
front then you're going to be able to
teach<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.680> formal<00:05:14.220> from<00:05:14.669> big<00:05:15.270> girl

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.290 

desperate

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.790 

this<00:05:32.930> shouldn't<00:05:33.199> be<00:05:33.259> too<00:05:33.349> hard

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.770 

at<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.610> point<00:05:38.849> basically<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.389> dog<00:05:39.539> does

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
at this point basically the dog does

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.719 
at this point basically the dog does
know<00:05:39.990> where<00:05:40.110> front<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:40.919> it's<00:05:41.520> another

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
know where front is and it's another

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.839 
know where front is and it's another
good<00:05:41.940> position<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.449> get<00:05:42.629> into<00:05:42.900> a<00:05:42.930> unit<00:05:43.289> test

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.580 

and<00:05:47.849> you<00:05:48.210> can<00:05:48.360> help<00:05:48.509> by<00:05:48.629> moving<00:05:48.960> your<00:05:49.139> feet<00:05:49.379> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
and you can help by moving your feet to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.409 
and you can help by moving your feet to
help<00:05:49.770> your<00:05:49.889> dog<00:05:50.039> find<00:05:50.340> front<00:05:50.669> but<00:05:50.940> that<00:05:51.270> is

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
help your dog find front but that is

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.339 
help your dog find front but that is
something<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.780> you're<00:05:51.930> going<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.139> need<00:05:52.319> to

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
something that you're going to need to

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.890 
something that you're going to need to
eventually<00:05:52.740> get<00:05:53.490> out<00:05:53.669> of<00:05:53.909> so<00:05:54.210> try<00:05:54.449> not<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.780> do

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
eventually get out of so try not to do

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.490 
eventually get out of so try not to do
too<00:05:54.930> much<00:05:55.319> of<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:57.020> because<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.259> don't<00:05:58.379> want

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
too much of it because you don't want

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.140 
too much of it because you don't want
your<00:05:58.710> dog<00:05:58.889> to<00:05:58.919> think<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.759> have<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.030> move

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
your dog to think that you have to move
