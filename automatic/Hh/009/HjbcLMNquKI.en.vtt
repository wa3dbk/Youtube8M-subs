00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.960
 for you to study at a university 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.639
 great university with whom a name 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 strong in the world 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.970
 You can not think of a place forever. 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.640
 But you need to try to think big. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 think global is to have a vision is so of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 how you are part of a whole and if everything 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 it's not just your neighborhood 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.760
 You know, I think this is very important. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.879
 I realize I realize that some 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.320
 people want to do it but they 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.210
 continue to be limited to a little 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 thought a little more local not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 Think big is not to think that you can 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.399
 you need to think you might not be 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.320
 You need to think you can give 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 solve global problems 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.120
 I had friends that I said this is not 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.610
 Your problem is a problem in the world. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 but I'm not interested in this type of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.689
 problem and that is not why 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 I'll stop thinking about this problem gives 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.570
 for you to solve it after you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 enter that kind of school you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.350
 get to start talking to people 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 solved major problems of the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.470
 world and normal people with you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.220
 understood then I think that 's the point is 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.189
 you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.900
 not only be limited to rainfall 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.460
 problem would be your thinking you 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 military you can not make think 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 Can you and can everyone have one? 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 really want and now really want to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.820
 It is different from simply saying here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.409
 at the moment it was 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.270
 simply saying there arrived a point 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.399
 that I said so now I want this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 It was a time that changed the plan now. 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 I'll do it from here. 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.299
 and it worked but it worked because I 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.290
 I put a lot of energy on top of myself 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.670
 I really wanted to search them all. 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.540
 relationships I could for 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.630
 be able to build this if you do not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.630
 put the know your heart it does not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.869
 Is doing 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.270
 make compassion I think it will be difficult 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.660
 difficult to leave and the university in this 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.459
 only one step is a means in fact I of 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.170
 I wanted new ones here . 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.060
 experience to prepare myself for the type 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.200
 problem I want to solve are 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.150
 some big global and complex and not 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
 also means that I will stop only at the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.459
 and I'm going to make more things go 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.410
 continue training because the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.810
 problems remain more difficult 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.690
 more complex and you 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 need to maintain your training 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:50.860
 then it would not say that it is think big and 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.750
 thinks passionately about what 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.750
 doing and not for
