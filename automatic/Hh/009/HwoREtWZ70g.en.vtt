using<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> gyroscope<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.190> see<00:00:14.400> here

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
using the gyroscope so you can see here

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.410 
using the gyroscope so you can see here
I'm<00:00:15.059> just<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.420> my<00:00:15.540> backyard<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:17.119> what<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.240> can

I'm just in my backyard and what you can
do<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:19.740> ahead<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.460> open<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> app

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
do is you go ahead and open up the app

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.849 
do is you go ahead and open up the app
and<00:00:21.390> then<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.600> hit<00:00:21.840> start<00:00:22.199> capture<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
and then you can hit start capture and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.359 
and then you can hit start capture and
it<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.939> start<00:00:24.840> capturing<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> photos<00:00:26.160> as

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it will start capturing the photos as

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.450 
it will start capturing the photos as
you<00:00:26.609> turn<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.869> keep

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
you turn so you can see if we just keep

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.500 
you turn so you can see if we just keep
turning<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.840> then<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.140> capture<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
turning like this then we can capture a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.860 
turning like this then we can capture a
full<00:00:37.969> 360-degree<00:00:38.969> scene<00:00:39.379> back<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.890> fill<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
full 360-degree scene back up to fill in

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.180 
full 360-degree scene back up to fill in
empty<00:00:42.870> spots<00:00:44.360> just<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.890> around

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
empty spots just go all the way around

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
empty spots just go all the way around
and<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.910> usually<00:00:48.210> works<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.570> pretty<00:00:48.780> well

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and it usually works out pretty well

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
and it usually works out pretty well
when<00:00:49.260> coming<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> beginning<00:00:49.980> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
when coming back to the beginning then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.170 
when coming back to the beginning then
we<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> hit<00:00:51.120> done<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.070> it'll<00:00:53.070> process<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we can hit done and it'll process it and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
we can hit done and it'll process it and
it's<00:00:54.480> cool<00:00:54.660> about<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.100> can

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it's cool about this is that now we can

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's cool about this is that now we can
use<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> gyroscope<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.180> turn

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
use the gyroscope to go back and turn

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.869 
use the gyroscope to go back and turn
around<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.930> even<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.879> somewhere

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
around so even if we go to somewhere

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.550 
around so even if we go to somewhere
else<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.970> still<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.439> same<00:01:08.600> image<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
else then we still see the same image so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
else then we still see the same image so
then<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.159> also<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.330> say<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
then you can also you can say that to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.920 
then you can also you can say that to
your<00:01:12.900> camera<00:01:13.170> roll<00:01:13.200> email<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.070> upload<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
your camera roll email or upload to

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.340 
your camera roll email or upload to
Twitter<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.020> believe<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.780> render<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
Twitter I believe so as to render it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
Twitter I believe so as to render it
back<00:01:19.590> into<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.400> single<00:01:21.390> picture<00:01:21.570> format<00:01:23.600> just

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
back into a single picture format just

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.260 
back into a single picture format just
wait<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.860> fast

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.940 

and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.719> can<00:01:30.930> choose<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> upload<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then you can choose to upload it to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
and then you can choose to upload it to
twit<00:01:32.219> pack<00:01:32.399> why<00:01:32.700> frog<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
twit pack why frog and then you have to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.959 
twit pack why frog and then you have to
choose<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.289> username<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.280> password<00:01:35.759> but

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
choose your username and password but

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.690 
choose your username and password but
we're<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.899> do<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.700> if

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
we're not going to do that now and if

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200 
we're not going to do that now and if
you<00:01:38.820> save<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> camera<00:01:39.780> roll<00:01:41.090> it'll<00:01:42.090> give

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you save it to camera roll it'll give

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
you save it to camera roll it'll give
you<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.630> progress<00:01:42.810> bar<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you a little progress bar and then you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.510 
you a little progress bar and then you
can<00:01:44.820> go<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.030> camera<00:01:48.299> roll<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
can go and in the camera roll you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.440 
can go and in the camera roll you can
get<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.789> picture<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:55.429> can't<00:01:56.429> really<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
get a picture and can't really do it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.260 
get a picture and can't really do it
with<00:01:57.539> one<00:01:57.780> hand<00:01:57.810> but<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.819> zoom<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.209> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
with one hand but you can zoom in and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.949 
with one hand but you can zoom in and
just<00:02:03.630> view<00:02:03.959> it<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> normal<00:02:04.439> photograph<00:02:05.959> so

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
just view it like a normal photograph so

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.389 
just view it like a normal photograph so
I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.380> app<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.679> really<00:02:07.740> cool<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I think this app is really cool and it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.880 
I think this app is really cool and it
creates<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:08.819> nice<00:02:09.360> picture<00:02:10.019> if<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.170> do

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
creates a really nice picture if you do

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.550 
creates a really nice picture if you do
it<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.480> 99<00:02:13.019> cents<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.440> App

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it well so it's 99 cents in the App

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.839 
it well so it's 99 cents in the App
Store<00:02:13.590> I'll<00:02:13.950> include<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.310> link<00:02:14.340> down<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
Store I'll include a link down in the

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.759 
Store I'll include a link down in the
