it<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:10.390> take<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> look<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:13.239> would

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
it and then take a look and you would

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.110 
it and then take a look and you would
actually<00:03:13.540> be<00:03:13.840> able<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.080> see<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:15.340> edge<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.940> any

actually be able to see the edge of any

existing laminate coating the appearance

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.090 
existing laminate coating the appearance
would<00:03:19.750> be<00:03:19.870> very<00:03:20.019> similar<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.769> piece<00:03:21.070> of

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
would be very similar to a piece of

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.740 
would be very similar to a piece of
scotch<00:03:21.489> tape<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.120> edge<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.510> piece<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
scotch tape that was left on the lens so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.850 
scotch tape that was left on the lens so
just<00:03:27.340> look<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.600> if<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.380> don't<00:03:29.560> see

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
just look for that and if you don't see

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.039 
just look for that and if you don't see
it<00:03:30.040> then<00:03:30.220> we<00:03:30.820> can<00:03:30.970> move<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> next<00:03:31.630> step

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
it then we can move on to the next step

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.620 
it then we can move on to the next step
with<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> thousand<00:03:32.950> grit<00:03:33.130> paper<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.760> begin<00:03:34.600> to

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
with a thousand grit paper and begin to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.740 
with a thousand grit paper and begin to
polish<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.760> ok<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:36.820> now<00:03:37.150> we're<00:03:37.360> going<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.510> use

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
polish it ok so now we're going to use

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.050 
polish it ok so now we're going to use
the<00:03:37.959> thousand<00:03:38.470> grit<00:03:38.650> sandpaper<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.519> exactly

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
the thousand grit sandpaper in exactly

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.240 
the thousand grit sandpaper in exactly
the<00:03:40.239> same<00:03:40.269> manner<00:03:40.450> as<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:41.079> use<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.470> 400<00:03:42.040> grit

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
the same manner as we use the 400 grit

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.449 
the same manner as we use the 400 grit
and<00:03:42.820> what<00:03:43.780> we're<00:03:43.900> doing<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.680> we're

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
and what we're doing now is we're

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.509 
and what we're doing now is we're
polishing<00:03:45.790> out<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.540> scratches<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.519> were

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
polishing out the scratches that were

created by the 400 grit paper and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.590 
created by the 400 grit paper and
remember<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.730> sand<00:03:52.650> horizontal<00:03:53.650> and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
remember the sand horizontal and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.130 
remember the sand horizontal and
vertical<00:03:55.739> never<00:03:56.739> sand<00:03:57.130> in<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> circular<00:03:57.640> motion
