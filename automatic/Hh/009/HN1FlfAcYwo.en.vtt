00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
you get this board which oddly enough is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.360 
you get this board which oddly enough is
a<00:01:19.730> puzzle<00:01:20.330> piece<00:01:20.510> although<00:01:20.870> I<00:01:21.290> mean<00:01:21.979> even

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
a puzzle piece although I mean even

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.660 
a puzzle piece although I mean even
together<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:23.120> fits<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.350> box<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.979> who<00:01:25.520> knows

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
together it fits in the box so who knows

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.730 
together it fits in the box so who knows
but<00:01:26.420> anyway<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.780> put<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:27.200> board<00:01:27.440> down<00:01:27.620> this

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
but anyway you put this board down this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.430 
but anyway you put this board down this
board<00:01:28.010> shows<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.580> what<00:01:29.330> each<00:01:29.570> side<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
board shows you what each side of the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.930 
board shows you what each side of the
die<00:01:30.590> means<00:01:30.920> now<00:01:31.160> it's<00:01:31.310> not<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.640> hard<00:01:31.880> to

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
die means now it's not so hard to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.990 
die means now it's not so hard to
remember<00:01:32.150> really<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.720> 1<00:01:33.050> &amp;<00:01:33.320> 2<00:01:34.250> &amp;<00:01:34.490> 3<00:01:34.520> well

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
remember really it's 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 well

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.980 
remember really it's 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 well
that's<00:01:35.030> pretty<00:01:35.390> simple

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's pretty simple

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.850 
that's pretty simple
it's<00:01:36.560> then<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:36.979> get<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> 4<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.800> then<00:01:39.800> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
it's then you get to the 4 and then the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.570 
it's then you get to the 4 and then the
5<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.000> then<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.900> 6<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.070> mean<00:01:43.280> once<00:01:43.460> you

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
5 and then the 6 but I mean once you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.760 
5 and then the 6 but I mean once you
play<00:01:43.820> often<00:01:44.300> enough<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.840> will<00:01:45.020> realize<00:01:45.080> what

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
play often enough you will realize what

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.490 
play often enough you will realize what
each<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.160> sides<00:01:46.400> means<00:01:46.810> but<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> game<00:01:48.140> now

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
each of the sides means but the game now

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.290 
each of the sides means but the game now

thing<00:02:19.070> happens<00:02:19.459> however<00:02:19.820> here<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.269> rolled<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.930> 1

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
thing happens however here I rolled a 1

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.610 
thing happens however here I rolled a 1
2<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.470> 3<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> two<00:02:22.340> dice<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.940> put<00:02:23.330> on

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
2 and a 3 and the two dice that I put on

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.039 
2 and a 3 and the two dice that I put on
top<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.860> tower<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.970> be<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.299> 4<00:02:26.810> or

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
top of the tower have to be a 4 or

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:27.310 
top of the tower have to be a 4 or
higher

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
higher

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.440 
higher
since<00:02:27.739> my<00:02:27.890> highest<00:02:28.190> size<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.489> 4<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.910> don't<00:02:29.120> have

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
since my highest size of 4 I don't have

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.320 
since my highest size of 4 I don't have
that<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> bust<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.769> however<00:02:31.160> once<00:02:31.940> per<00:02:32.180> round

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
that so I bust it however once per round

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.960 
that so I bust it however once per round
I<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.630> get<00:02:32.959> rid<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.370> Dyson<00:02:34.760> just

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
I can get rid of one of my Dyson just

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.390 
I can get rid of one of my Dyson just
and<00:02:35.269> re-roll<00:02:35.690> 2<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.019> them<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> mulligan<00:02:36.680> well

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
and re-roll 2 of them as a mulligan well

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.130 
and re-roll 2 of them as a mulligan well
this<00:02:37.610> works<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.120> 5<00:02:38.299> but<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> 2<00:02:38.780> doesn't<00:02:39.049> work

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
this works the 5 but the 2 doesn't work

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.370 
this works the 5 but the 2 doesn't work
so<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:39.500> out<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:40.160> got<00:02:40.580> no<00:02:40.820> points<00:02:41.330> try<00:02:42.200> that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
so I'm out I got no points try that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.920 
so I'm out I got no points try that
again<00:02:42.500> cuz<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:42.980> was<00:02:43.040> pretty<00:02:43.250> lame<00:02:43.580> if<00:02:44.269> you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
again cuz that was pretty lame if you

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.780 
again cuz that was pretty lame if you
roll<00:02:45.200> doubles<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.799> I<00:02:45.980> roll<00:02:46.160> double<00:02:46.519> fives

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
roll doubles like I roll double fives

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.229 
roll doubles like I roll double fives
here<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.870> can<00:02:48.080> place<00:02:48.380> these<00:02:48.680> fives<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.489> put

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
here you can place these fives and put

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.449 
here you can place these fives and put
them<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:51.019> on<00:02:51.440> top<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.950> other<00:02:52.070> number<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
them up on top of the other number and

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.770 
them up on top of the other number and
you<00:02:52.519> can<00:02:52.580> put<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:52.760> 3<00:02:53.060> dice<00:02:53.239> out<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.660> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
you can put all 3 dice out so it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.890 
you can put all 3 dice out so it's
useful<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.200> roll<00:02:54.620> doubles<00:02:55.190> now<00:02:55.970> here's<00:02:56.780> a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
useful to roll doubles now here's a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.080 
useful to roll doubles now here's a
couple<00:02:57.230> things<00:02:57.470> let's<00:02:57.799> say<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.489> this<00:02:58.670> point<00:02:58.910> I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
couple things let's say at this point I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.850 
couple things let's say at this point I
decide<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.510> stop<00:02:59.780> my<00:02:59.959> roll<00:03:00.170> because<00:03:00.380> putting

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
decide to stop my roll because putting

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.039 
decide to stop my roll because putting
on<00:03:01.010> top<00:03:01.100> of<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.340> 5<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.670> pretty<00:03:01.880> hard<00:03:02.090> when<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
on top of a 5 is pretty hard when that

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.080 
on top of a 5 is pretty hard when that
happens<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.560> take<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.920> value<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> top<00:03:04.820> die

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
happens I take the value of the top die

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.390 
happens I take the value of the top die
so<00:03:05.540> here<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.720> have<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.870> 5<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.380> multiply<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.220> times

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so here I have a 5 and multiply it times

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.310 
so here I have a 5 and multiply it times
the<00:03:07.579> number<00:03:07.820> dice<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.239> 3<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.660> if<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.840> stop<00:03:09.079> right

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
the number dice at 3 so if I stop right

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.120 
the number dice at 3 so if I stop right
now<00:03:09.350> I'd<00:03:09.620> get<00:03:09.769> 15<00:03:10.190> points<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.450> never<00:03:11.660> stop

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
now I'd get 15 points but I never stop

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.510 
now I'd get 15 points but I never stop
so<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.160> roll<00:03:13.370> again<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:14.540> 3<00:03:15.200> 4<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.590> 6<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.010> 6<00:03:16.190> works

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
so I roll again up 3 4 and 6 the 6 works

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.760 
so I roll again up 3 4 and 6 the 6 works
with<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.270> 3<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.599> 4<00:03:17.780> dome<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:18.410> let's<00:03:18.560> try

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
with the 3 and the 4 dome so let's try

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.309 
with the 3 and the 4 dome so let's try
my<00:03:18.920> mom

terrible right so I get nothing now if

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.559 
terrible right so I get nothing now if
you<00:03:57.569> manage<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.049> get<00:03:58.169> all<00:03:58.439> 12<00:03:58.889> dice<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.609> one<00:03:59.669> big

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
you manage to get all 12 dice on one big

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.929 
you manage to get all 12 dice on one big
pile<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.010> will<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:04.310> 200<00:04:05.310> bonus<00:04:05.609> points

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
pile then you will get 200 bonus points

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.140 
pile then you will get 200 bonus points
which<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.239> basically<00:04:06.560> give<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.859> game

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
which will basically give you the game

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.339 
which will basically give you the game
probably<00:04:09.150> unless<00:04:09.389> someone<00:04:09.659> else<00:04:09.689> manages<00:04:10.260> to

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
probably unless someone else manages to

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.379 
probably unless someone else manages to
do<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> too<00:04:10.799> although<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.849> think<00:04:12.150> when<00:04:12.269> your

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
do it too although I think when your

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.780 
do it too although I think when your
second<00:04:12.780> dice<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.139> high<00:04:13.349> then<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.799> mean<00:04:14.549> you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
second dice that high then I mean you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.990 
second dice that high then I mean you
should<00:04:15.419> have<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.810> roll<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.430> if<00:04:17.699> there's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
should have to roll to see if there's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.839 
should have to roll to see if there's
some<00:04:18.209> kind<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.720> know<00:04:19.070> make<00:04:20.070> them<00:04:20.250> fall<00:04:20.459> over<00:04:20.820> I
