series and in this video we're going to
cover<00:00:07.649> using<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.639> file<00:00:09.030> get<00:00:09.450> content

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
cover using the file get content

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.919 
cover using the file get content
contents<00:00:10.800> function<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.940> get<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> contents<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
contents function to get the contents of

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.189 
contents function to get the contents of
a<00:00:13.049> file<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.590> put<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.639> into<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.940> string<00:00:15.299> so

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
a file and put that into a string so

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.570 
a file and put that into a string so
we'll<00:00:16.590> start<00:00:16.859> off<00:00:17.070> our<00:00:17.430> PHP<00:00:17.970> file<00:00:18.359> I'm<00:00:19.170> going

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
we'll start off our PHP file I'm going

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.400 
we'll start off our PHP file I'm going
to<00:00:20.580> save<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:23.210> get<00:00:24.210> file<00:00:24.570> PHP<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:27.410> when

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to save this as get file PHP and when

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.450 
to save this as get file PHP and when
I'm<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> put<00:00:28.920> anything<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> here

line this is the second line and we'll

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.770 
line this is the second line and we'll
just<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.770> another<00:00:47.370> space<00:00:47.640> import<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

just have another space import this is
the<00:00:49.350> fourth<00:00:49.680> line<00:00:50.489> okay<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> nicely

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the fourth line okay so we have a nicely

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
the fourth line okay so we have a nicely
formatted<00:00:52.649> text<00:00:53.219> document<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

first second third and fourth line we
have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> line<00:00:57.840> break<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.789> here<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.969> then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have a line break here here and then

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
have a line break here here and then
again<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.250> line<00:01:02.399> four

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
again here to go into line four

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.170 
again here to go into line four
so<00:01:03.480> we'd<00:01:03.660> save<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.229> we'll<00:01:04.589> save<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.600> M

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
so we'd save this we'll save this as M

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.260 
so we'd save this we'll save this as M
documents<00:01:09.180> ext<00:01:10.549> okay<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.150> our

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
documents ext okay so now we have our

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.050 
documents ext okay so now we have our
text<00:01:12.479> document<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> read<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.060> using

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
text document we want to read this using

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
text document we want to read this using
PHP<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> output<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.860> web<00:01:17.009> page<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.909> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
PHP and output it to our web page so we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.370 
PHP and output it to our web page so we
can<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> file<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.350> contents

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
can do this using the file get contents

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.130 
can do this using the file get contents
function<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> declare<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
function so we're going to declare the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.770 
function so we're going to declare the
file<00:01:22.409> path<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> we're<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> use

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
file path up here and we're going to use

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.609 
file path up here and we're going to use
a<00:01:26.060> full<00:01:27.060> stop<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> forward<00:01:28.500> slash

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
a full stop and then a forward slash

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.990 
a full stop and then a forward slash
that's<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> represent<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.820> we're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that's going to represent that we're

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
that's going to represent that we're
searching<00:01:30.329> inside<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.189> directory<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
searching inside of this directory that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
searching inside of this directory that
the<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.820> file<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.270> PHP<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> inside<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.470> then

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the get file at PHP is inside and then

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
the get file at PHP is inside and then
we're<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> say<00:01:35.820> document.txt<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
we're going to say document.txt so that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
we're going to say document.txt so that
is<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.329> file<00:01:39.540> were<00:01:39.720> looking<00:01:40.020> for

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880 
file on the score get underscore
contents<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.659> brackets<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.320> we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
contents and then in brackets here we

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410 
contents and then in brackets here we
need<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> specify<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.700> file<00:02:08.970> when<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.239> want

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
need to specify the file when you want

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
need to specify the file when you want
to<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> contents<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.770> case<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
to get the contents of in this case it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.730 
to get the contents of in this case it
is<00:02:11.310> file<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is file so we do that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.500 
is file so we do that
and<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.190> done<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.240> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and what this is done now is if this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.260 
and what this is done now is if this
file<00:02:15.780> exists<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.800> will<00:02:17.010> retain<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.910> entire

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
file exists it will retain the entire

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.080 
file exists it will retain the entire
file<00:02:18.570> as<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> string<00:02:19.350> inside<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.670> document

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
file as a string inside of this document

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
file as a string inside of this document
variable<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.260> if<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.470> doesn't<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.980> will

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
variable and if it doesn't it will

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.460 
variable and if it doesn't it will
return<00:02:23.400> false<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.900> should<00:02:25.200> be<00:02:25.290> able<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
return false so we should be able to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.200 
return false so we should be able to
echo<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.040> out<00:02:26.220> no<00:02:26.400> problem<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.030> it's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
echo out this out no problem so it's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.470 
echo out this out no problem so it's
just<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.540> call<00:02:27.750> document<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:30.000> we'll<00:02:30.210> save

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
just a call document and then we'll save

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.940 
just a call document and then we'll save
this<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:31.710> file<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> PHP<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.110> you'll<00:02:34.770> notice

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
this get file the PHP and you'll notice

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680 
this get file the PHP and you'll notice
that<00:02:35.130> we<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.640> our<00:02:35.670> line<00:02:36.030> breaks<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
that we don't have our line breaks and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.200 
that we don't have our line breaks and
that's<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:38.130> right<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:39.030> we're

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
that's because I'm right what we're

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.030 
that's because I'm right what we're
doing<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.480> now<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> PHP<00:02:40.140> file<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:40.920> like

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
doing right now a PHP file this is like

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.910 
doing right now a PHP file this is like
HTML<00:02:41.670> document<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:42.870> can't<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.500> use

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
HTML document so we can't actually use

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.480 
HTML document so we can't actually use
you'll<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:44.850> actually<00:02:45.240> when<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:45.750> go<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> our

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
you'll see actually when we go to our

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.370 
you'll see actually when we go to our
notepad<00:02:47.490> here<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.840> actually<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.230> new

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
notepad here and it's actually in new

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.230 
notepad here and it's actually in new
lines<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.430> I'm<00:02:50.520> going<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.820> now<00:02:51.000> is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
lines but what I'm going to do now is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.150 
lines but what I'm going to do now is
just<00:02:51.270> I'm<00:02:51.660> going<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.380> loop<00:02:52.560> through<00:02:52.770> each<00:02:52.830> line

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
just I'm going to loop through each line

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.300 
just I'm going to loop through each line
but<00:02:53.940> I'll<00:02:54.420> show<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.660> actually<00:02:55.080> first<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:56.190> we

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
but I'll show you actually first what we

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.570 
but I'll show you actually first what we
can<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.590> specify<00:02:58.590> header<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
can do you can just specify header and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.860 
can do you can just specify header and
then<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.380> puts<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> content<00:03:02.010> type<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.940> put<00:03:03.780> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
then in puts it content type and put it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
then in puts it content type and put it
to<00:03:03.960> text<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.530> sorry<00:03:05.160> text<00:03:05.640> forward<00:03:05.940> slash

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to text on sorry text forward slash

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.510 
to text on sorry text forward slash
plain<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:07.410> will<00:03:07.620> treat<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> document

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
plain and this will treat the document

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.010 
plain and this will treat the document
like<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.940> normal<00:03:09.090> text<00:03:09.420> document<00:03:09.870> like

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
like it's a normal text document like

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.830 
like it's a normal text document like
it's<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.130> we<00:03:11.220> load<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.730> you'll<00:03:12.660> see

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it's this so if we load this you'll see

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.960 
it's this so if we load this you'll see
that<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.140> lines<00:03:13.350> all<00:03:13.590> formatted<00:03:14.190> nice<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that the lines all formatted nice and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.670 
that the lines all formatted nice and
neatly<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.990> we<00:03:16.140> don't<00:03:16.290> want<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.560> that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
neatly but we don't want to do that

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.620 
neatly but we don't want to do that
because<00:03:16.860> if<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:18.090> let's<00:03:18.330> say<00:03:18.480> we

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
because if we do that then let's say we

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.670 
because if we do that then let's say we
want<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.040> echo<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.880> some<00:03:21.060> HTML<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
want to you know echo out some HTML and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.040 
want to you know echo out some HTML and
echo<00:03:23.010> out<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:24.290> break<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.560> then<00:03:25.710> bold<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:27.840> is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
echo out and break and then bold this is

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.370 
echo out and break and then bold this is
bold<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:31.020> then<00:03:31.560> end<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.550> there<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:34.170> we<00:03:34.260> want

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
bold and then end up there so if we want

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.320 
bold and then end up there so if we want
to<00:03:34.410> echo<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.950> inside<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.490> get<00:03:35.610> father<00:03:35.820> PHP

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
to echo that inside the get father PHP

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.300 
to echo that inside the get father PHP
you'll<00:03:37.050> see<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.470> doesn't<00:03:37.620> recognize<00:03:37.890> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
you'll see that it doesn't recognize the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.430 
you'll see that it doesn't recognize the
HTML<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.540> can't<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.260> I'll<00:03:40.320> be

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
HTML so we can't do that so I'll be

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
HTML so we can't do that so I'll be
practical<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.100> our<00:03:41.160> web<00:03:41.310> page<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.330> what<00:03:42.420> I'm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
practical for our web page so what I'm

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.570 
practical for our web page so what I'm
going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> do<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.110> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.980> create<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.280> simple

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
going to do is going to create a simple

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.430 
going to do is going to create a simple
loop<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:47.270> facing<00:03:48.270> me<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.630> do<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.990> use<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
loop so facing me to do is use the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.990 
loop so facing me to do is use the
explode<00:03:49.800> function<00:03:49.830> from<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.580> previous

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
explode function from a previous

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.530 
explode function from a previous

tutorial

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.450 
tutorial
now<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.170> explode<00:03:52.590> function<00:03:52.770> I'm<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> do

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
now the explode function I'm going to do

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.480 
now the explode function I'm going to do
we're<00:03:54.030> going<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.270> explode<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.050> file<00:03:55.290> by<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.250> new

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
we're going to explode the file by a new

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.060 
we're going to explode the file by a new
line<00:03:56.760> or<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.600> not<00:03:57.960> break<00:03:58.290> what<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> text<00:03:58.980> new

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
line or not not break what a text new

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.010 
line or not not break what a text new
line<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.490> we<00:03:59.580> can<00:03:59.700> do<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.970> using<00:04:00.210> backslash

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
line and we can do this using backslash

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.700 
line and we can do this using backslash
n<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.370> represents<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.090> new<00:04:03.240> line<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.380> we

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
n and that represents a new line so we

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.730 
n and that represents a new line so we
can<00:04:04.740> declare<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.400> new<00:04:05.580> variable<00:04:05.610> called<00:04:06.740> call

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
can declare a new variable called call

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.150 
can declare a new variable called call
it<00:04:07.800> lines<00:04:08.810> almost<00:04:09.810> set<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.110> value<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.380> explode

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
it lines almost set the value to explode

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.570 
it lines almost set the value to explode
and<00:04:11.550> then<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:13.459> backslash<00:04:14.459> N<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:16.580> the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
and then the backslash N and then the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.060 
and then the backslash N and then the
second<00:04:18.390> parameter<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.380> need<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> specify<00:04:20.010> is

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
second parameter we need to specify is

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.650 
second parameter we need to specify is
what<00:04:20.280> we<00:04:20.340> want<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.580> explode<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.570> going

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
what we want to explode and it's going

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.120 
what we want to explode and it's going
to<00:04:21.720> be<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.140> document<00:04:22.620> because<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:23.010> why

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
to be the document because that's why

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.320 
to be the document because that's why
we're<00:04:23.280> holding<00:04:23.610> all<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.630> our

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
we're holding all of our

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.570 
we're holding all of our
the<00:04:25.810> file<00:04:25.990> string<00:04:26.349> so<00:04:26.919> what<00:04:27.069> we've<00:04:27.400> done<00:04:27.520> here

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the file string so what we've done here

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.570 
the file string so what we've done here
is<00:04:28.319> we're<00:04:29.319> just<00:04:29.470> splitting<00:04:29.680> up<00:04:30.069> this<00:04:30.280> document

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
is we're just splitting up this document

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.960 
is we're just splitting up this document
string<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.449> this<00:04:32.169> whole<00:04:32.379> text<00:04:32.860> file<00:04:33.039> by<00:04:33.699> each

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
string so this whole text file by each

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.990 
string so this whole text file by each
new<00:04:34.000> line<00:04:34.539> using<00:04:35.259> this<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.830> now<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.639> can<00:04:36.849> do

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
new line using this and now we can do

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.210 
new line using this and now we can do
what<00:04:37.659> we<00:04:37.750> want<00:04:37.780> with<00:04:38.169> those<00:04:38.319> new<00:04:38.530> lines<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.039> all

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
what we want with those new lines so all

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.270 
what we want with those new lines so all
we<00:04:39.280> need<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.460> do<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:41.289> can<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:41.650> create<00:04:42.190> a

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
we need to do is we can just create a

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.999 
we need to do is we can just create a
for<00:04:42.550> each<00:04:42.669> loop<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.960> best<00:04:44.259> way<00:04:44.409> to<00:04:44.440> do<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.830> okay

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
for each loop the best way to do it okay

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.990 
for each loop the best way to do it okay
we're<00:04:45.639> going<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.789> say<00:04:45.940> for<00:04:46.210> each<00:04:46.330> lines<00:04:47.259> as<00:04:48.000> a

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
we're going to say for each lines as a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.600 
we're going to say for each lines as a
new<00:04:49.720> line<00:04:51.180> I'm<00:04:52.180> going<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:52.569> simply<00:04:52.870> echo<00:04:53.080> out

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
new line I'm going to simply echo out

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.020 
new line I'm going to simply echo out
echo<00:04:55.139> new<00:04:56.139> line<00:04:56.379> and<00:04:56.800> concatenate<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.759> break

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
echo new line and concatenate a break

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.469 
echo new line and concatenate a break
onto<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:59.340> so<00:05:00.340> let's<00:05:00.520> just<00:05:00.610> quickly<00:05:01.060> run

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
onto that so let's just quickly run

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.990 
onto that so let's just quickly run
through<00:05:01.509> this<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.620> we've<00:05:02.889> we<00:05:03.610> don't<00:05:03.789> need<00:05:03.879> this

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
through this so we've we don't need this

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.369 
through this so we've we don't need this
anymore<00:05:04.270> by<00:05:04.629> the<00:05:04.659> way<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.870> can<00:05:05.080> delete<00:05:05.259> the

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
anymore by the way you can delete the

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.939 
anymore by the way you can delete the
header<00:05:05.560> content<00:05:06.190> type<00:05:06.490> text<00:05:06.879> plane<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:07.990> here

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
header content type text plane so here

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.469 
header content type text plane so here
we've<00:05:09.129> specified<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.909> file<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.330> want<00:05:10.389> to

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
we've specified the file you want to

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.659 
we've specified the file you want to
search<00:05:10.750> which<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.110> document<00:05:11.650> dot<00:05:11.770> txt<00:05:12.129> I'm

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
search which is document dot txt I'm

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.640 
search which is document dot txt I'm
saying<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.120> inside<00:05:13.479> the<00:05:13.659> directory<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.199> this

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
saying it inside the directory that this

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.040 
saying it inside the directory that this
file<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:15.039> in<00:05:15.159> and<00:05:15.370> then<00:05:16.300> what<00:05:16.659> we're<00:05:16.780> doing<00:05:16.810> is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
file is in and then what we're doing is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.350 
file is in and then what we're doing is
getting<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.530> contents<00:05:18.069> of<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.280> file<00:05:18.879> using

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
getting the contents of that file using

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.330 
getting the contents of that file using
the<00:05:19.389> function<00:05:19.930> file<00:05:20.259> on<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.680> scroll<00:05:20.889> get<00:05:21.129> on

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
the function file on the scroll get on

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.490 
the function file on the scroll get on
the<00:05:21.460> scroll<00:05:21.669> contents<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.389> now<00:05:23.259> this

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the scroll contents and now this

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.369 
the scroll contents and now this
variable<00:05:23.860> document<00:05:24.669> now<00:05:25.210> holds<00:05:25.719> this<00:05:26.080> whole

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
variable document now holds this whole

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.680 
variable document now holds this whole
text<00:05:26.830> file<00:05:26.979> document<00:05:27.099> dot<00:05:27.639> txt<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> string

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
text file document dot txt as a string

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.629 
text file document dot txt as a string
but<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.590> problem<00:05:29.889> is<00:05:30.009> that<00:05:30.039> it's<00:05:30.310> formatted

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
but the problem is that it's formatted

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.420 
but the problem is that it's formatted
in<00:05:30.969> a<00:05:31.060> text<00:05:31.389> file<00:05:31.539> so<00:05:31.860> new<00:05:32.860> lines<00:05:33.099> aren't

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
in a text file so new lines aren't

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.300 
in a text file so new lines aren't
recognized<00:05:33.849> by<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.120> HTML<00:05:34.719> as<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:35.830> sky<00:05:36.130> it's

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
recognized by the HTML as it sky it's

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.100 
recognized by the HTML as it sky it's
different<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:36.940> what<00:05:37.479> we'll<00:05:37.630> need<00:05:37.659> to<00:05:37.840> do<00:05:37.960> is

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
different so what we'll need to do is

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.439 
different so what we'll need to do is
make<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.469> new<00:05:38.650> variable<00:05:38.949> called<00:05:39.069> lines<00:05:39.460> and<00:05:40.240> we

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
make a new variable called lines and we

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.110 
make a new variable called lines and we
explode<00:05:40.930> that<00:05:41.199> using<00:05:41.590> works<00:05:42.430> folded<00:05:42.819> by<00:05:42.940> each

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
explode that using works folded by each

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.129 
explode that using works folded by each
new<00:05:43.150> line<00:05:43.509> and<00:05:44.069> we'll<00:05:45.069> exploding<00:05:45.520> documents

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
new line and we'll exploding documents

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.080 
new line and we'll exploding documents
then<00:05:47.139> we<00:05:47.229> simply<00:05:47.740> create<00:05:47.860> for<00:05:48.190> each<00:05:48.310> loop<00:05:48.550> to

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
then we simply create for each loop to

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.790 
then we simply create for each loop to
look<00:05:49.240> through<00:05:49.449> each<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.810> every<00:05:50.050> line<00:05:50.289> inside

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
look through each and every line inside

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.209 
look through each and every line inside
of<00:05:50.949> this<00:05:51.270> explode<00:05:52.270> inside<00:05:53.229> of<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.500> end<00:05:53.800> result

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
of this explode inside of the end result

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.459 
of this explode inside of the end result
we<00:05:54.310> got<00:05:54.460> from<00:05:54.639> the<00:05:54.789> explode<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:56.050> we'll<00:05:56.289> just

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
we got from the explode and we'll just

echo<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.129> actual<00:05:57.490> line<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:58.060> then<00:05:58.719> a<00:05:58.930> break<00:05:59.169> so

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
echo the actual line and then a break so

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.999 
echo the actual line and then a break so
we<00:05:59.680> say<00:06:00.009> this<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:02.460> then<00:06:03.460> we<00:06:03.729> can<00:06:03.759> just<00:06:05.009> below

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
we say this and then we can just below

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.649 
we say this and then we can just below
this<00:06:06.250> and<00:06:06.580> you'll<00:06:06.669> see<00:06:06.849> that<00:06:06.969> I<00:06:07.029> recognizes

the<00:06:07.810> new<00:06:07.930> lines<00:06:08.169> the<00:06:08.680> source<00:06:09.069> code<00:06:09.310> and<00:06:10.090> we<00:06:10.210> now

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
the new lines the source code and we now

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.959 
the new lines the source code and we now
have<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.900> breaks<00:06:11.139> so<00:06:11.639> it's<00:06:12.639> more<00:06:12.789> it's
