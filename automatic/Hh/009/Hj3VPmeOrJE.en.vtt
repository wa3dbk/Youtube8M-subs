00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 so my dear there is the income to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 a little interview regarding the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 new tournament that will start the days 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.630
 and you already see the title and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 of course in the background ms cars 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 the world cup 2015 speak after the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 Lions club the next chance for us 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 now a little bit too 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.470
 prove after lyons capo was 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.180
 actually did not play bad 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 but you can actually say it like that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.800
 were too stupid for fifa we were too stupid 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.599
 for fifa there are ways out and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 here and today in this cup we get 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.720
 So the next possibility there 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.189
 maybe a little something 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 to be redressed in quotation marks 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 and I was invited as I said 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 from the msk to this tournament of which he is one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.070
 thick thank you to you the whole will 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.809
 with several larger fifa channels 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 start friends you see in the background 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.920
 times the whole participant faded in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 with msk logically much deeper 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 the dan browns he fifa.com united 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.030
 then find we are therefore based here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.940
 with the start lions is medi 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 and patrick talk bmtv max gaming though 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 in the pepper and of course also away fifa 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 that speaks the participants are the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.539
 last time to join 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 Friends that is not yet 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 group division or so we come 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.820
 Immediately to speak against whom 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 we play that would already be drawn 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.720
 but first of all we take care of each other 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.640
 of course, the rules like that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 whole looks to background it is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.759
 only players of own nation allowed 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.299
 I will become the nation for you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.939
 imagine 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.710
 that was assigned to us or we have 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.270
 a number pulled youtube and behind 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 the number he then puts a nation 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 which is the weather right now 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.299
 background friends every card types 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 are allowed that means man of the match 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.020
 it worms team of the seas us what 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 Anyway it will be the national jerseys 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
 oliver Bendig plays then are trainings 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 cards banned fairplay desired and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.119
 the larger youtuber invites you to play 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.829
 Basically, yes, the things taken 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 actually what you like fairplay and co 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.630
 are logical and not big 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.090
 rules but simply gamble have fun 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.979
 and yes fifa gamble that 's what in the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 foreground is 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.470
 there are still prizes to win 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.759
 the whole thing will work 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 lead naturally on to you 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.390
 To what extent must times think and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.969
 Although her seat gets the first place 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.950
 a 100 euro coupon the second 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.930
 place a 50 euro coupon and the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.429
 third place a 30 euro coupon in 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.840
 the sense friends then we have to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.310
 give gas together then gets 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.190
 Of course, the community does it all 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.320
 no question 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.940
 And now of course you get friends 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.860
 we come first group I introduce you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.810
 first the nation before the boys I put 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.280
 let's see the nation before we do it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 our times as a bit of spain namely 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.970
 I finally got twelve 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 pay behind each one nation 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.480
 i stuck for the teeth 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.910
 decided friends of the playmaker of 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.830
 cedar and it was finally england 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.750
 we must or may depending on how 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.890
 you can see it now with england and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.870
 you see in the background I have 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.890
 the whole time now on the ps4 because I 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.720
 you still connected and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 connected off quickly so a bit 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.080
 we have built a few games 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.910
 already like the decision our nation 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.230
 Of course, shapes can be expected 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.730
 Write suggestions in the comments 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.810
 little open for everything better there 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.280
 maybe they should go into that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.660
 tournament whether it because here and there a 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.550
 I have a few changes now 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.800
 really almost the best 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.380
 the respective position in the team 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.790
 I'm built in the 4 3 1 2 system though 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 not sure which one was there 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.170
 join harry caine and walcott 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.220
 rooney with which the as yet with am 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.960
 start henderson terry bains hard small 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.530
 and now the good man beside it 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.239
 the hosted Herculean is not allowed 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.410
 but the trucks you have or for 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.860
 friends , that's where the name comes from 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.390
 not a 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.800
 So we have the start as I said 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.330
 like to write in if you like the team 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.220
 cool if we maybe there 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.570
 I am supposed to change a little bit 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.470
 as I said, open to everything and then 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.270
 We will certainly be cool 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.160
 troop find above last finally 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.040
 the whole then get started but 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.350
 not on the ps4 but on the xbox 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.870
 when friends and in the ten still too 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.390
 good last just so fast yes the 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 Results, as it were called the draw 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.070
 more or less who plays in which 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.989
 group as is in group b but it 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.330
 of course, it brings with cuba to namely 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.400
 many times gold united brazil 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.320
 if you can do it with belgium too 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.280
 not a bad choice girl and patrick 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.890
 I do not know who of the two 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 Ultimately, it also plays with Colombia 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.590
 not such a bad choice 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.060
 but now also from the nation 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.459
 The release is probably one of the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.019
 worse lambach continues with roughly how 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.940
 and this is our group like it is in 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.470
 a group with that was there talk to 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.970
 Spain he is allowed to play with 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.280
 Germany there are a few right 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 We'll become a classic with the msc 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.200
 on the founder of the ms k cups 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.180
 the same time in the group stage 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.010
 meet and we as mentioned with england 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.050
 then the group c with much deeper the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.130
 allowed to run with the max gaming tv 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.170
 with france 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.520
 and jakes fifa with chile not at all 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.590
 So bad choice if you think about it 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.360
 to start in the sun is that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.640
 Not so wrong with alexis sanchez 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.590
 example with vidal so bad game 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.760
 Although not , of course, too 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.230
 one of the nations maybe not 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.570
 quite so occupied on all positions top 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.790
 are and then finally group n 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.220
 nummero de with the conversation with pro us 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.600
 the one with portugal may lions with 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.000
 holland with the netherlands and 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.620
 argentina may ultimately be the wm 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.280
 take that Asia is in the background 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.250
 the groups of the ms k cups of the msk world 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.130
 tour 2015 or world cup not only 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.260
 friends and we may we said against 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.940
 was it there and against msk rheinstrand 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.010
 likes to write in the comments 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.630
 how far do you think we will get something 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.160
 so the goal should actually be for 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.080
 the community so at least the third 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.090
 Platz that looked a bit too 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.590
 with dust and as I said what 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.550
 have any suggestions like us 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.810
 venture a bit more 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.190
 improve or change 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.690
 likes to write this in the comments 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.010
 then we will drum around again 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.780
 take care that is not even fix 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.430
 what I showed you was just like that 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.140
 a quick idea like us the whole 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.030
 could possibly build but there I am 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.380
 I, as I said open to all friends 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.000
 and the tips I would say something 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.200
 with the little info video 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.610
 it is still a bullish heat 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.560
 Forgive me that is not the time 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.760
 I did not really have many videos 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.080
 when it will hopefully again 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.040
 bit cooler gets in the morning 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.620
 be a little cooler if you do that 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.850
 video is here in frankenland in 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.200
 beautiful franc country again 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.790
 to be a bit cooler that's just fine 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.990
 and then I think I can 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.790
 install a bit more but 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.800
 otherwise this is up here you know me 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.220
 I'm under a pitch in the second 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.500
 stock 35 6 degrees was the record what is 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.480
 I had temperature in here 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.800
 would say so again at the moment 32 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.810
 although what meanwhile already quarter 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.190
 but we have to go through eleven 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.570
 In that sense I do not want anymore 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.770
 continue rum rum friends when 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.240
 I would be glad to see you at the tournament 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.570
 me over a thumbs up a lot 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.280
 looking forward 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.510
 and in that what I want 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.840
 wish you a wonderful day makes it 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.140
 Well 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.140
 skin in until then slippers servus
