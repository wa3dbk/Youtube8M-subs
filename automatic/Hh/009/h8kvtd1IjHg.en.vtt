this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:02.129> some<00:00:03.060> more<00:00:03.270> endometrial<00:00:04.170> tissue

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
this is some more endometrial tissue

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.490 
this is some more endometrial tissue
you'll<00:00:05.759> prep<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.270> believe<00:00:06.600> me<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.080> now<00:00:07.230> but

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
you'll prep the believe me for now but

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.560 
you'll prep the believe me for now but
as<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.830> zoom<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.340> you'll<00:00:08.580> see<00:00:08.639> yourself<00:00:09.269> but

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
as we zoom in you'll see yourself but

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.350 
as we zoom in you'll see yourself but
notice<00:00:10.019> unlike<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.040> one<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.429> saw<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
notice unlike the one we just saw in the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.049 
notice unlike the one we just saw in the
proliferative<00:00:13.019> phase<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:14.219> endometrial

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
proliferative phase this endometrial

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.359 
proliferative phase this endometrial
tissue<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.660> not<00:00:15.900> connected<00:00:16.529> glad<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.920> muscle

tissue is not connected glad of muscle

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
tissue is not connected glad of muscle
katrien<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.630> looks<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.170> could<00:00:19.320> have

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
katrien so this looks like it could have

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.439 
katrien so this looks like it could have
been<00:00:19.470> scraped<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:20.369> like<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> T&amp;C

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
been scraped off like a T&amp;C

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.960 
been scraped off like a T&amp;C
whereas<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> other<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> nice<00:00:23.670> section

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
whereas the other one was a nice section

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
whereas the other one was a nice section
through<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> entire<00:00:24.750> uterus<00:00:25.350> where<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> saw

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
through the entire uterus where you saw

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.779 
through the entire uterus where you saw
a<00:00:25.920> lot<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> muscle<00:00:26.730> when<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.539> primarily

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to contrast it with what we just

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.209 
going to contrast it with what we just
saw<00:00:46.350> called<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.520> proliferative<00:00:48.420> phase<00:00:49.219> in

that's<00:01:28.020> why<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.350> called<00:01:28.409> secretory<00:01:29.100> phase

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you found a mitosis you might be looking

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
you found a mitosis you might be looking
very<00:01:37.619> hard<00:01:37.920> before<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.520> found<00:01:38.729> many<00:01:39.689> mitosis

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439

very hard before you found many mitosis
in<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> glands<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.210> glands<00:01:42.630> are

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
in the glands because these glands are

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
in the glands because these glands are
no<00:01:43.049> longer<00:01:43.290> proliferating<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> now

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
surface and in general there's more

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.400 
surface and in general there's more
edema<00:02:26.760> throughout<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:29.540> stroma<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.840> then

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
edema throughout the stroma and then

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.320 
edema throughout the stroma and then
eventually<00:02:31.890> you'll<00:02:32.340> see<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> secretion

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
eventually you'll see the secretion

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.780 
eventually you'll see the secretion
material<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> later<00:02:35.310> part<00:02:35.730> of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
material and then in the later part of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.780 
material and then in the later part of
the<00:02:36.120> secretory<00:02:36.630> phase<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.710> will<00:02:37.830> see<00:02:38.040> decidua

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the secretory phase you will see decidua

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030 
the secretory phase you will see decidua
l--<00:02:38.970> looking<00:02:39.720> cells<00:02:40.050> surrounding<00:02:40.860> this

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
l-- looking cells surrounding this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.820 
l-- looking cells surrounding this
almost<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.330> progesterone<00:02:42.840> level<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.650> so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
almost like the progesterone level is so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830 
almost like the progesterone level is so
high<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.640> almost<00:02:44.940> getting<00:02:45.300> ready<00:02:45.600> for

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
high now it's almost getting ready for

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.050 
high now it's almost getting ready for
pregnancy<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.310> none<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.610> most

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
pregnancy but there is none in most

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180 
pregnancy but there is none in most
cases<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.080> can't<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.650> call<00:02:49.860> these

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
cases so you can't really call these

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580 
cases so you can't really call these
cells<00:02:50.490> decidua<00:02:51.270> why<00:02:51.959> don't<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.350> call

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
cells decidua why don't you just call

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.770 
cells decidua why don't you just call
them<00:02:52.830> pre<00:02:53.190> decidua<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> very

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
them pre decidua and then the very

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.500 
them pre decidua and then the very
latest<00:02:55.080> stage<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.370> secretory<00:02:56.910> phase<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
latest stage of the secretory phase is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
latest stage of the secretory phase is
you<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:57.720> neutrophils<00:02:58.320> infiltrating<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
you have neutrophils infiltrating the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.760 
you have neutrophils infiltrating the
glands<00:02:59.550> because<00:03:00.300> now<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.870> lost<00:03:01.230> its<00:03:01.470> blood

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
glands because now it's lost its blood

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.220 
glands because now it's lost its blood
supply<00:03:01.800> it's<00:03:02.310> becoming<00:03:02.640> necrotic<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.870> being

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
supply it's becoming necrotic it's being

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.770 
supply it's becoming necrotic it's being
shed<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.280> very<00:03:05.490> very<00:03:05.790> much<00:03:05.850> inflamed<00:03:06.570> in

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
shed so it's very very much inflamed in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.980 
shed so it's very very much inflamed in
the<00:03:06.930> later<00:03:07.170> stages<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> if<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.300> want<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.780> keep

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
the later stages but if you want to keep

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.150 
the later stages but if you want to keep
something<00:03:10.830> very<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.150> very<00:03:12.660> simple<00:03:13.650> what<00:03:14.130> I

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
something very very very simple what I

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.520 
something very very very simple what I
love<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.700> do<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.510> important<00:03:19.320> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
love to do is that it's so important to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.370 
love to do is that it's so important to
differentiate<00:03:20.630> proliferative<00:03:21.630> phase<00:03:22.519> from

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
differentiate proliferative phase from

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.900 
differentiate proliferative phase from
secretory<00:03:25.380> phase<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:27.320> in<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.040> secretory

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
secretory phase and in the secretory

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.990 
secretory phase and in the secretory
phase<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:31.410> will<00:03:31.530> always<00:03:31.860> find<00:03:32.430> either

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
phase you will always find either

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.350 
phase you will always find either

you see along here

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.850 
you see along here

the evacuee at the base later on they go

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.979 
the evacuee at the base later on they go

the gland secretions within the gland
means<00:03:52.920> secretory<00:03:53.430> phase<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.540> reason<00:03:54.900> why

it's critically important to be able to
diagnose<00:03:59.060> secretory<00:04:00.060> phase<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:01.110> because<00:04:01.590> once

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
diagnose secretory phase is because once

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.750 
diagnose secretory phase is because once
you<00:04:02.130> say<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.820> this<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.600> secretory<00:04:04.140> phase<00:04:04.760> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
you say that this is secretory phase you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.140 
you say that this is secretory phase you
