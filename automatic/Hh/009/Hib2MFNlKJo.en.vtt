00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
is you time there's the spring there's

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.160 
is you time there's the spring there's
the<00:00:57.690> original<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> original<00:01:00.059> nut<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
the original the original nut this is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
the original the original nut this is
the<00:01:04.170> contact<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.979> causes<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> horn<00:01:06.170> we're

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the contact that causes the horn we're

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.810 
the contact that causes the horn we're
going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> Center<00:01:07.920> nut<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.310> these

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
going to take the Center nut off these

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
going to take the Center nut off these
three<00:01:09.090> screws<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.850> will

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
three screws here and then this will

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:29.180 
three screws here and then this will
come<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.420> off

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:02:00.890 

let's<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.180> for<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.480> horn

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.730 

and<00:02:01.900> that's<00:02:02.110> all<00:02:02.290> that's<00:02:02.380> left

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:15.720 

so<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.580> stays<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.680> stays<00:02:14.580> something<00:02:15.580> new

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so this stays this stays something new

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:28.320 
so this stays this stays something new
goes<00:02:16.060> on<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.640> loosely

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
goes on this and here it is loosely

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.160 
goes on this and here it is loosely
mounted<00:02:30.240> got<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.330> put<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> center<00:02:31.810> knot<00:02:31.990> on

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
mounted got to put the center knot on

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.740 
mounted got to put the center knot on
and<00:02:32.410> tighten<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:40.150> goes<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
this goes on next and then I'm in with

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.810 
this goes on next and then I'm in with
an<00:02:59.980> allen<00:03:00.340> key<00:03:00.930> now<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:01.960> wrench<00:03:02.490> yeah

then all that's left is the horn button
I'm<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:11.770> replace<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.310> horn<00:03:12.520> button<00:03:12.760> with

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
I'm gonna replace the horn button with

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.200 
I'm gonna replace the horn button with
something<00:03:13.450> better<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:13.930> later

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
something better a little later

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
steering wheel the reason why I went

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.640 
steering wheel the reason why I went
with<00:03:33.550> this<00:03:33.790> one<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.180> because<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.320> book<00:03:35.620> that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
with this one is because in a book that

with this one is because in a book that
I<00:03:35.890> have<00:03:37.020> there's<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.170> steering<00:03:38.530> wheel<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.830> it

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
I have there's a steering wheel in it

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.700 
I have there's a steering wheel in it
that's<00:03:39.130> an<00:03:39.280> option<00:03:39.640> for<00:03:40.320> modifications<00:03:41.320> for
