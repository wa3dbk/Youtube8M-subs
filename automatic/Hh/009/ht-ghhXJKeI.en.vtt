00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.370
 peugeot was the first manufacturer to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 launch a full hybrid diesel car 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.439
 with hybrid4 technology 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.999
 what is it exactly and what 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.800
 are the real benefits that we can 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.560
 expect 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 first of all a word about technology 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 the hybrid4 is the association of a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.960
 diesel engine an electric motor and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 a battery 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 the combination of these three elements is going 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 to recover energy in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.149
 in order to reduce consumption 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 fuel but the hybrid4 is not 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.539
 that this is also a new 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.579
 driving sensation with on the one hand 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.829
 electric driving phases without 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.199
 noise and without vibration and secondly 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.109
 increased dynamism when combining 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.129
 two sources of power let's see 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.260
 now how to get the best 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 using this technology on a daily basis 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.929
 the driver has two new 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.820
 information specific to hybrid 4 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.739
 the power meter that allows you to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.410
 visualize the power provided by the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.140
 car but also the power recovered 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.910
 by the battery and the central screen that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.870
 allows you to see the activity of the system 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.240
 HYbrid4 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.950
 it is understood that it is a technology of 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 tip is yet very simple to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.420
 use all the management of the system is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.840
 Automatic and completely transparent 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840
 for the user 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.680
 currently I roll at low speed and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.380
 it's the electric motor that drives 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.240
 the car as soon as I'm going to press 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.980
 the accelerator the diesel engine is going 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 take over automatically for 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 provide the necessary power 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 the gearbox is a box of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.549
 speeds driven the changes of 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.039
 reports go almost unnoticed 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.660
 because we use the power of the engine 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.709
 electric to smooth the acceleration the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.500
 car allows accelerations 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.849
 powerful 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.010
 it is equipped with a diesel engine of 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.440
 163 horses and under certain conditions 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.340
 you even have 200 horses thanks 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 to the contribution of the electric motor 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.349
 advice in terms of savings from 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.150
 fuel with a conventional vehicle 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.099
 diesel or gasoline it is advisable to 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.950
 accelerate moderately to limit the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.480
 consumption with the hybrid4 one can 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 favor more acceleration 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.349
 frank which will solicit the engine less 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.349
 long and more efficiently 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.230
 the particularity of the hybrid4 is to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.730
 recover energy when braking or 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.220
 more specifically in the phases of 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.940
 deceleration when we lift the foot of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.099
 accelerator 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.300
 the hybrid vehicle 4 offers a brake 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.230
 engine more important than a vehicle 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.510
 conventional 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 in fact it's not really about a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.200
 engine brake in the classic sense of the term 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.880
 but the action of the electric motor 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.160
 which works at that time as a 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.250
 dynamo and that's where the battery gets 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.750
 recharge the more you use this brake 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.940
 motor plus you recharge the battery 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.120
 and the more energy you store 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.120
 Free 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.350
 if you do not anticipate 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.240
 sufficient braking distances 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.250
 you will tend to brake with the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.660
 conventional brake its braking to 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.980
 repetition is so much energy 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.790
 free lost in platelets from 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.350
 brake with the hybrid4 the engine brake and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.700
 so effective that with a little 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.090
 anticipation in the phases of 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.250
 braking 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.790
 we almost use the pedal of 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 classic brake 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.460
 after acceleration and braking 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.070
 now let's see the driving phases 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.350
 to stabilize that's where we'll be able to 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.680
 take advantage of the energy recovered and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.750
 stored in the battery when we 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.570
 reaches the desired speed for example 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.180
 50 km hour we will naturally rise 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.590
 the foot of the accelerator 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.210
 then just hold the foot 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.090
 on the pedal just what it takes for 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.560
 keep up the speed it is in these 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.270
 driving conditions that the engine 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.240
 electric will be able to take over 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.160
 diesel engine below 70 km 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.110
 hour we will be able to benefit from phases 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.180
 electric taxiing so without 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.530
 fuel consumption and all that 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.860
 in a completely transparent way 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.810
 for the driver as I said 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.840
 the important thing is the right dosage of 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.790
 the accelerator in stabilized rolling if 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.650
 you adopt a jerky driving done 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.590
 accelerations and braking 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.180
 the diesel engine will start often and 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.470
 the phases of electric rolling that 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.340
 make us gain in consumption go 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.780
 to be much shorter 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.350
 it is therefore necessary to adopt a 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.600
 flexible 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.890
 the vehicle is then chained to 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.530
 long phases of electric driving 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.490
 with diesel driving phases but 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.830
 this electric ride 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.740
 what does it represent in the end is it 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.630
 significant in daily use 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.150
 some numbers by adopting these good 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.150
 practices in urban and peri- urban use 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.419
 electric taxiing is 50% 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.480
 time and 30% of the distance 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.000
 in other words on a full is 300 km 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.460
 that you will go in electric 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.460
 300 km without noise and without vibration 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.690
 in summary to make the most of 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.490
 of your hybrid vehicle 4 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.890
 just adopt three good 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.980
 practices favor accelerations 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.360
 short to reach your speed 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.980
 Anticipate the braking to recover 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.320
 a maximum amount of energy 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.060
 electric and roll in flexibly for 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.030
 promote electric taxiing and 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.800
 consumption reduction to put 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.990
 its principles in practice I proposed to 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.360
 Madame mercier owner of a 508 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.370
 diesel to make a course in hybrid4 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.410
 without giving him any indication on the 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.690
 conduct to be adopted on this first 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.880
 course his consumption was 5 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.260
 liters 8 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.910
 after a few hours of driving and my 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.460
 explanations on good practice 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.080
 his consumption went down to 4 liters 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.180
 nine on this same course 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.670
 so she reduced her consumption of 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.470
 almost a liter and this without changing its 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.880
 average speed 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.850
 for me it was a first on our 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.190
 hybrid cars so that there is a 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.350
 little adaptation phase to have but 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.160
 at the same time what made us especially very 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.690
 easy to drive 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.169
 so it's true that it is done very quickly 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.389
 and it's very nice 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.210
 hybrid4 technology allows to 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:15.629
 reconcile power sobriety new 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.879
 driving pleasure and motor skills 4 4 en 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.659
 effect and it's an exclusive benefit of 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.909
 this technology 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:22.439
 the electric motor that drives the 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.749
 rear wheels instantly transforms 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:27.860
 the car in real four wheels 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:27.860
 motor when needed 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:38.159
 this effective 4.4 mode always available 

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.020
 completes the assets and the 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.860
 unparalleled versatility of vehicles 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.860
 hybrids 4
