00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Good day to all of us today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:12.599
 consider such a love honor of ours 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:14.340
 automatically as the answer of the lock number not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 here we see here here such here 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.010
 chip you all break early 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.090
 or later she will be so interesting 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.050
 fact of the factory she is actually the nose of this 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.590
 the market comes to half of that cut 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.300
 caret photo 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.300
 He then she no longer comes to this 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.579
 small size and smash and such 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 small especially for the fact that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.350
 time is beaten completely 4 sets 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.210
 there must fully begin and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 products and knock back rows 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.050
 here 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.289
 now we have it to heart 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.040
 You see what the gap is there crash 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.550
 thanks to him all this will be firmly 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.100
 in spite of the spring she 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.050
 some fluctuations on amortizing but 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 yet weight 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.440
 rows and springs 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.350
 distortions of the body especially where not the most 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.040
 tough because i offer here such 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 option when this is all insert 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.120
 the price of what is good 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 now i sent him you see she there 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.110
 worth 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.710
 fluctuations are on small and that is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.770
 vadimov bit it costs one gum 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.200
 mine go there two because it 's 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.520
 leaves 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.799
 that's how much 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.000
 still a gap at all worn on her 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:06.119
 as if here are these gum grains 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 such it if anyone knows the gum from 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.390
 nozzles 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.930
 you have here in any vaz injector 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:21.549
 it is specifically with the eyes of the son of 12 pad 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.099
 the most common engine 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:31.180
 rezinochki not put right here and she already 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 there is no rumble too she just me 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 it moves slightly to the left, this is 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.980
 that is not Novakov who should be there 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.049
 for closing the lock but on the sides it is not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.150
 walks and I donâ€™t know why plant engineers 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.870
 such a thing they did not come up with smart for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.409
 your me they will not go away at all 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.870
 I know very reports and funny with me 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.049
 Now it is Ukrainian production 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.790
 this lock here and let's say it is done 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.790
 my knees because my body burst 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.520
 and I had to change the tongue of all 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.620
 the rest was stupid by the way 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.080
 I burst the factory case a little . 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.490
 a little trim it wore a woman 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.210
 so strong because the players 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.560
 health seemed so broken and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.570
 I drove the car market bought 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.370
 there was no desire to buy for 300 rubles 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.700
 whole castle 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.620
 top all the same bought and only 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.580
 this part 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.799
 now I show on the plane fluff can be seen 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.049
 but already beggar beggar chariot 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.430
 Only this is the strength of the new part 3 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.030
 stroke 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.170
 is I can not see the food on 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.269
 carrying hours 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.810
 it will turn out lines generally in this 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.810
 sleeve 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.630
 comes almost to the body itself 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.020
 does not reach 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.790
 space stands in common holy 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.900
 is that if 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.180
 your still make here such a system 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.569
 here you are at the point that do not reach 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.569
 to end 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.820
 who don't get hold of danfoss 8 are not broken and 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.240
 not there in different sizes in general 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.880
 never mind 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.800
 you need to pick one up on the market 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.600
 mating pain sleeve then region 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 the frame is equipped with a corkscrew 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.520
 straight from the axis 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:43.090
 It was not worth about 7 years that's all and 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.280
 it turns out buys badly you don't need 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.310
 of these 2 3 things because never 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.509
 different sizes are different and 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.009
 to notice here is that this is necessary and the background 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.400
 do not enter completely 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:57.479
 well fit it if of course you have 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.310
 4 himself broken this we need to buy the whole 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.560
 all top or repair h3 turns out 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.009
 or the hull itself is optional 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.220
 I will say right away I had such a shit that 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.590
 body itself 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.980
 where do you turn this part out 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.440
 this court 4 4 dropped out of it 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.070
 that is pressing in to put it mildly not 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.980
 quality 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.770
 called this did not happen even an example 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.880
 this was not what happened on your own 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:33.770
 and the risk is straight removing brothers 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:36.710
 put a little foil in to hammer it 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.810
 somewhere here is such a thing after planted 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.970
 plug but have forgot about it after that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.710
 sort of there so out you're wrong 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.650
 wriggle doesn't crash don't know because 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.340
 What is it made so but was glancing at 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.840
 the plant above them does not need to pick up what 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.750
 was completely all hatch go in here 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.260
 then you can then with a large agito floor 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.780
 millimeter to keep the gap 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.890
 so that you yourself went to a rabbit 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.890
 good for 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:17.300
 answer code is it otherwise it will not be you 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.300
 just not strong enough to close it
