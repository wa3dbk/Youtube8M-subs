now with canoes and long ladders you

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.649 
now with canoes and long ladders you
know<00:00:56.470> they're<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> very<00:00:56.949> long<00:00:57.309> long<00:00:57.790> item<00:00:58.510> to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
know they're a very long long item to

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.240 
know they're a very long long item to
carry<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.320> it's<00:00:59.470> nice<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.890> be<00:01:00.010> able<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
carry so it's nice to be able to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.119 
carry so it's nice to be able to
disperse<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.449> length<00:01:01.690> along<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.530> length<00:01:02.920> of

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
disperse the length along the length of

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.460 
disperse the length along the length of
the<00:01:03.220> vehicle<00:01:03.670> obviously<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.989> can<00:01:05.170> carry<00:01:05.379> a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
the vehicle obviously you can carry a

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.969 
the vehicle obviously you can carry a
canoe<00:01:05.920> if<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.520> had<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:07.200> ladder<00:01:08.200> style<00:01:08.680> rack

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
canoe if you had a ladder style rack

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.100 
canoe if you had a ladder style rack
mounted<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.760> bed<00:01:09.940> rails<00:01:10.180> but<00:01:10.869> you'd<00:01:11.080> have

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
mounted to the bed rails but you'd have

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.500 
mounted to the bed rails but you'd have
a<00:01:11.229> lot<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.470> overhang<00:01:12.159> on<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:13.090> rear<00:01:13.299> of<00:01:13.330> the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
a lot of overhang on the rear of the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.569 
a lot of overhang on the rear of the
canoe<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.049> a<00:01:14.350> lot<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.650> times<00:01:14.860> if<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.280> front<00:01:15.460> of

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
canoe and a lot of times if the front of

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.310 
canoe and a lot of times if the front of
the<00:01:15.670> canoe<00:01:15.939> doesn't<00:01:16.509> clear<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.869> windshield

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
the canoe doesn't clear the windshield

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.789 
the canoe doesn't clear the windshield
because<00:01:18.009> it<00:01:18.159> kind<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.579> angles<00:01:19.329> downward<00:01:19.810> near

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
because it kind of angles downward near

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.859 
because it kind of angles downward near
the<00:01:20.920> bow<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.430> might<00:01:21.609> hit<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.969> roof<00:01:22.149> so<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.750> is

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
the bow it might hit the roof so this is

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.200 
the bow it might hit the roof so this is
a<00:01:22.899> really<00:01:23.140> great<00:01:23.320> way<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.859> spread<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.700> length

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
a really great way to spread the length

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.149 
a really great way to spread the length
of<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.780> canoe<00:01:26.049> across<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.829> length<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
of a canoe across the length of the

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.459 
of a canoe across the length of the
vehicle<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:28.210> let's<00:01:28.479> talk<00:01:28.840> about<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.289> goal

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
vehicle so let's talk about the goal

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.389 
vehicle so let's talk about the goal

far as installation it couldn't be

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.370 
far as installation it couldn't be
easier<00:01:48.270> it'll<00:01:49.270> come<00:01:49.479> out<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.749> the<00:01:49.840> box<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.289> a

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
few pieces the load bar is just needs to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.590 
few pieces the load bar is just needs to
be<00:01:54.069> attached<00:01:54.399> simply<00:01:54.850> with<00:01:54.999> this<00:01:55.119> these

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
be attached simply with this these

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.169 
be attached simply with this these
brackets<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.259> three<00:01:56.469> bolts<00:01:56.770> up<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:57.179> this

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
brackets and three bolts up here this

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.489 
brackets and three bolts up here this
top<00:01:58.479> piece<00:01:58.920> goes<00:01:59.920> into<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.520> lower<00:02:00.850> section

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
top piece goes into this lower section

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.529 
top piece goes into this lower section
and<00:02:02.499> there's<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.549> pin<00:02:03.850> holding<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.359> together

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
and there's a pin holding it together

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.419 
and there's a pin holding it together
and<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.079> allows<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.679> be<00:02:05.859> lowered<00:02:06.219> and

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
and this allows it to be lowered and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.450 
and this allows it to be lowered and
raised<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.659> get<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:08.140> bar<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.740> level

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
raised so you can get that bar as level

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.910 
raised so you can get that bar as level
as<00:02:09.580> possible<00:02:09.819> with<00:02:10.509> your<00:02:10.660> crossbar<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
as possible with your crossbar on the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.710 
as possible with your crossbar on the
roof<00:02:12.069> of<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.340> truck<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.300> has<00:02:13.569> that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
roof of the truck so it has that

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.960 
roof of the truck so it has that
adjustability<00:02:14.290> built<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.920> which<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.220> nice<00:02:15.520> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
adjustability built in which is nice and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.199 
adjustability built in which is nice and
then<00:02:16.660> there's<00:02:16.840> just<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> simple<00:02:17.620> hitch<00:02:17.800> bolt
