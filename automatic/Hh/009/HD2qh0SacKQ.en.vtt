00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
lethal and tactical is go ahead and just

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
lethal and tactical is go ahead and just
take<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.630> steady<00:01:30.930> aim<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.950> leave

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

very<00:02:30.840> situational<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.129> mtar<00:02:32.610> which

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
very situational and then the mtar which

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.540 
very situational and then the mtar which
is<00:02:33.000> absolutely<00:02:33.599> sick<00:02:34.349> because<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
is absolutely sick because with the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.369 
is absolutely sick because with the
muzzle<00:02:35.910> breaking<00:02:36.300> grip<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.110> pretty

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
muzzle breaking grip on it it's pretty

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.600 
muzzle breaking grip on it it's pretty
much<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.590> an<00:02:37.830> assault<00:02:38.129> rifle<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.550> i'll

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.190 
much like an assault rifle and i'll
technically<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.300> submachine<00:02:39.900> gun<00:02:40.080> which

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
technically this is submachine gun which

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
technically this is submachine gun which
like<00:02:40.410> why<00:02:40.590> I'm<00:02:40.860> tarm<00:02:41.160> w2<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.060> install<00:02:42.360> rifle

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
like why I'm tarm w2 is it install rifle

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.839 
like why I'm tarm w2 is it install rifle
but<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.620> change<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.129> submachine<00:02:44.640> gun

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
but they change it to a submachine gun

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.790 
but they change it to a submachine gun
which<00:02:45.060> I'm<00:02:45.209> fine<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.440> still

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
which I'm fine with because it still

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.520

damage<00:05:05.909> with<00:05:05.940> increased<00:05:06.479> kick<00:05:06.750> but<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.560> a

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
damage with increased kick but this is a

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.219 
damage with increased kick but this is a

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
bold action so it really doesn't make a

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.469 
bold action so it really doesn't make a
difference<00:05:10.520> something<00:05:11.520> cool<00:05:11.639> this<00:05:11.909> gun<00:05:12.120> has<00:05:12.150> a
