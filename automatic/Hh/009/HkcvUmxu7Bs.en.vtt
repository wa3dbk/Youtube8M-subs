00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.899
 my father's brother, I'm glad to welcome you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.899
 on update 2102 14 the stove was driven 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.100
 not 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.140
 what do I want to go immediately to liquidate 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.240
 on liquidation you will notice a change 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 color to black, he still decided 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.390
 buy paint and paint all the walls 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.920
 also black corporation has hired 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.320
 guest workers and built five more 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.770
 floors now in liquidation will be as much as 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.239
 25 floors well, I did not pass the previous 20 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.600
 you oh well of course pizzhu nothing there 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.210
 added maybe on telly such bugs in 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.829
 Okay, let's not dwell on it 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.610
 on pvp meet new card 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.750
 destination no not so meet on 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:18.649
 Paul A.P. 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:21.619
 one value card undermined 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.430
 I really liked the map as well as 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.649
 to many players on pc card meat pro 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.780
 there will be a lot of kick too many 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.150
 bugs naturally you can climb on 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.460
 every fence on every door I already 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.680
 could jump somewhere somewhere any class 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.560
 will stay in the black on this card and doctors 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.049
 And snipers different positions very many 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 also want to mark three floors this 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.049
 subway 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 the most basic too on which you 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.549
 Solve and replanting 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.250
 probably the first week the game is not on this 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.140
 map you will be confused because where 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.210
 there what kind of replanting do i have until the end 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.869
 and did not understand that is the card is not at all 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.900
 simple 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.030
 two new weapons for let's yell say 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.310
 say for loans tell for loans for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.429
 warbax machine gun xm8 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.009
 m &amp; g and budget mp9 pp per engine 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.040
 and mp9 is the first weapon in the warface. 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.159
 which can be bought for warbax not 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.909
 forever for a day a week and on 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.829
 month 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.989
 but something tells me that this gun 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.209
 this money is not worth it at all 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.629
 principle for the first levels, she probably 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.239
 God will have you, but I advise you to buy 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.459
 week since it is most profitable and 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 try her new machine gun 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.959
 xm8 lmd for attack aircraft well, and I stayed with them 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.540
 happy satisfied why because on 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.819
 semi battle with machine guns in general and do not go 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.010
 even on the floor and especially on the elimination 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.159
 machine gun it will be very good because 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.319
 in it for 25 rounds in more than the KRG well 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.239
 and so naturally it will go very 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.139
 a lot of clips in comparison which is better 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.169
 rpk and xm8 well and other labuden 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.569
 trifle but nice f12 key 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.840
 Standard now specify the folder on top 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.819
 the screen and the color of greens bukovok more 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.349
 one nice little thing is the connection 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.020
 it also seemed to me that nickname 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.050
 a little bit of 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.640
 and, more precisely, they made a little smaller 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.070
 less in size don't know why not 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 I know why I do not know how the total is added 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.050
 selectable aiming mode 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 constantly on the keys added grip 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.130
 ability to select squat 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.320
 constantly on holding the key but this 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.500
 some kind of hemorrhoids in my opinion basically 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.290
 I missed all that was I stay over 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 the fact that before the appearance was changed 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.100
 notifications in the game client 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.040
 changed location and size 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.870
 some elements of the game interface 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.060
 yes, the interface has become 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.890
 a little less and in general everything is somehow 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.210
 has become 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.950
 Minimal here in my opinion I penetrated 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.260
 mentioned that he also became smaller 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.720
 improved quick play system improved 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.620
 protection system 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.440
 oh well now for loans you can 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:10.120
 buy forever and at stake for medic sig 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.900
 552 for the engineer and oog 3 was for 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.450
 attack aircraft 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.630
 gun steyr m9 now you can 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.959
 buy yes no no pizzhu too 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.720
 you canâ€™t get a gun again 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.570
 steyr n9 developers will be a new weapon 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.450
 the old do not want to fix these things but here 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.850
 on this and finish the total current update 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.600
 new machine gun is very cool since its 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.889
 better to use on in a budget mp9 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.919
 engineering pp 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.590
 there is no other way to call another 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.050
 parties noobs guys low rank we 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.719
 must therefore bend correctly from 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.430
 new card 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.289
 I was satisfied with the destination 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.060
 principle undermining for me was the most 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.189
 the best mode so i'm very 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.529
 I was glad this map is a map for me 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:59.349
 even filled some card of call of 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.300
 duty don't remember the exact name 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.180
 the acquisition of credit weapons is a plus 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.930
 it always remains a plus 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.779
 cons we will find based on when and lead 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.240
 update everything will be stupid lag but in 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.909
 overall then you know also wanna arrange 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.939
 a game with subscribers which will be 22 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.370
 February at 13 00 Moscow time 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.680
 this is an approximate time, keep an eye on the exact 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.050
 information my group VKontakte connection 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.300

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.610
 in their monitors Well you was 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.629
