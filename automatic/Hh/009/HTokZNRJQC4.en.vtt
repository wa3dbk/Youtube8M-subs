00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to try and recreate it anyway I started

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.049 
to try and recreate it anyway I started
off<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:36.149> running<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.170> sort<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> large<00:00:38.370> barrels

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
off by running a sort of large barrels

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.200 
off by running a sort of large barrels
curling<00:00:39.809> iron<00:00:39.989> through<00:00:40.350> my<00:00:40.469> hair<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.210> mostly

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
curling iron through my hair and mostly

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
curling iron through my hair and mostly
focusing<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> ends<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.860> really

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
focusing on the ends I'm not really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
focusing on the ends I'm not really
worried<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> curls<00:00:45.059> stays<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
worried if the curls stays or not it was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
worried if the curls stays or not it was
just<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.559> extra<00:00:47.039> volume<00:00:47.300> of<00:00:48.300> course

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
just for a little extra volume of course

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
just for a little extra volume of course
that's<00:00:48.809> optional<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.980> always<00:00:50.100> sleep<00:00:50.640> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that's optional you can always sleep on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
that's optional you can always sleep on
rollers<00:00:51.239> overnight<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
rollers overnight if you want to do I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
rollers overnight if you want to do I
just<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> curling<00:00:54.270> hair<00:00:54.420> before<00:00:54.629> noon

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just think that curling hair before noon

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
just think that curling hair before noon
just<00:00:55.170> gives<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.949> bit<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> an<00:00:56.430> extra

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
just gives you a little bit of an extra

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.599 
just gives you a little bit of an extra
oomph<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.600> sometimes<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> even<00:00:58.829> makes<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
oomph and sometimes it even makes the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.599 
oomph and sometimes it even makes the
hair<00:01:00.300> easier<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.899> work<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.250> especially<00:01:02.250> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
hair easier to work with especially if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
hair easier to work with especially if
it's<00:01:02.730> fine<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> generally<00:01:03.840> straight

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's fine and it's generally straight

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310 
it's fine and it's generally straight
like<00:01:04.619> it'll<00:01:04.860> stay<00:01:05.280> better<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.479> updo<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
like it'll stay better in an updo as I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.340 
like it'll stay better in an updo as I
said<00:01:07.500> I've<00:01:07.680> already<00:01:08.180> curled<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.360> hair<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.260> I'm

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
said I've already curled my hair and I'm

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
said I've already curled my hair and I'm
gonna<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:11.430> deep<00:01:11.729> side<00:01:12.060> part<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
gonna make a really deep side part I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
gonna make a really deep side part I
think<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.280> can

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
think that kind of as well as you can

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
think that kind of as well as you can
see<00:01:14.580> give<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> instant<00:01:15.390> sort<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> lift

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
see give you that instant sort of a lift

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.060 
see give you that instant sort of a lift
just<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> crown<00:01:18.439> she<00:01:19.439> had<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
just a little at the crown she had a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
just a little at the crown she had a
lace<00:01:20.340> braid<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.320> was

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lace braid and in the back there was

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.719 
lace braid and in the back there was
some<00:01:22.650> sort<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.040> chignon<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
some sort of a chignon I think that

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
some sort of a chignon I think that
it'll<00:01:26.729> work<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.210> well<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> us

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it'll work really well on those of us

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.069 
it'll work really well on those of us
who<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.750> PLL<00:01:30.750> err

who have a PLL err

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
who have a PLL err
dsl<00:01:31.799> hair<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.430> might<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.150> bit

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
dsl hair this might be a little bit

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
dsl hair this might be a little bit
trickier<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:33.689> someone<00:01:34.200> whose<00:01:34.439> hair<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.619> waist

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
trickier for someone whose hair is waist

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.450 
trickier for someone whose hair is waist
length<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.490> longer

look at to that miss it's a lace braid
which<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.370> basically<00:01:40.820> like<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.360> French<00:01:41.660> braid

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
which is basically like a French braid

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.380 
which is basically like a French braid
where<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.680> only<00:01:42.890> add<00:01:43.130> hair<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:43.460> from<00:01:43.940> one<00:01:44.120> side

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
hers is kind of loose at the top I have

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.160 
hers is kind of loose at the top I have
this<00:01:58.220> tendency<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.820> pull<00:01:59.150> my<00:01:59.300> really<00:01:59.870> really

tight
but<00:02:01.490> um<00:02:01.640> hers<00:02:02.060> was<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.270> bit<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.810> loose<00:02:02.990> side

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.540 

you<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.980> buy<00:02:14.190> your<00:02:14.400> ear<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:18.209> free<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
you get to buy your ear just free the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.250 
you get to buy your ear just free the
rest<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> normally<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.750> use<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> clear

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
rest of it normally and use a clear

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.160 
rest of it normally and use a clear
elastic<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:23.220> tie<00:02:23.670> off<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.480> rest<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.840> your<00:02:24.989> hair

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
elastic to tie off the rest of your hair

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.190 
elastic to tie off the rest of your hair
you<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.650> make<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.920> somewhat<00:02:26.730> low<00:02:27.090> ponytail

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you want to make a somewhat low ponytail

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.860 
you want to make a somewhat low ponytail
I<00:02:28.230> used<00:02:28.920> two<00:02:29.010> clear<00:02:29.310> elastic<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.540> I'm<00:02:30.720> going

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
I used two clear elastic and I'm going

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.020 
I used two clear elastic and I'm going
to<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> tool<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.880> don't

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to use a tool like this if you don't

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.479 
to use a tool like this if you don't
have<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.510> obviously<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.739> use<00:02:35.310> your

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
have one obviously you can just use your

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.840 
have one obviously you can just use your
fingers<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.989> make<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> little<00:02:37.470> loopy<00:02:38.370> pocket

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
fingers to make the little loopy pocket

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.940 
fingers to make the little loopy pocket
thing<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.200> find<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.890> is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
thing but I just find that this is

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
thing but I just find that this is
neater<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.940> little<00:02:42.060> easier<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.660> I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
neater and it's a little easier and I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080 
neater and it's a little easier and I
never<00:02:42.900> get<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.230> use<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.890> I'm<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.880> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
never get to use it so I'm going to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:56.360 
never get to use it so I'm going to
today<00:02:45.360> my<00:02:45.900> first<00:02:46.170> loop<00:02:54.769> how<00:02:55.769> you're<00:02:55.980> gonna<00:02:56.069> do

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
today my first loop how you're gonna do

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.620 
today my first loop how you're gonna do
it<00:02:56.400> again<00:02:59.989> but<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.260> time<00:03:02.330> put<00:03:03.330> your<00:03:03.360> hair

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
it again but this time put your hair

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.660 
it again but this time put your hair
through<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.720> want<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.019> hold<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> base

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
through you want to hold on to the base

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
through you want to hold on to the base
of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> ponytail<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.880> watch<00:03:12.080> I'm<00:03:13.080> just

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
of the ponytail so watch I'm just

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.479 
of the ponytail so watch I'm just
pulling<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> ends<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.100> my<00:03:14.130> hair<00:03:14.250> through

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.180 

but<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.760> got<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.269> little<00:03:20.510> loop<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.800> this<00:03:22.010> is

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
but I got this little loop and this is

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.399 
but I got this little loop and this is
the<00:03:22.310> loop<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.549> I'm<00:03:22.879> gonna<00:03:23.030> pin<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:24.019> I've<00:03:24.170> got

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
the loop that I'm gonna pin and I've got

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.339 
the loop that I'm gonna pin and I've got
somewhat<00:03:24.920> larger<00:03:25.370> than<00:03:25.400> usual<00:03:25.909> at<00:03:26.690> rich<00:03:27.080> bobby

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
somewhat larger than usual at rich bobby

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.910 
somewhat larger than usual at rich bobby
pins<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.670> you're<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.060> going<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.830> kind<00:03:30.830> of

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
pins and you're just going to kind of

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800 
pins and you're just going to kind of
stick<00:03:31.220> them<00:03:31.430> through<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.849> loop<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.659> as

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
stick them through the loop and as

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.300 
stick them through the loop and as
you're<00:03:33.019> doing<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.530> grab<00:03:33.799> some<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.159> the

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
you're doing that to grab some of the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.699 
you're doing that to grab some of the
hair<00:03:34.340> from<00:03:34.730> your<00:03:34.849> scalp<00:03:35.239> as<00:03:35.480> well<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:36.290> way<00:03:36.470> it

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
hair from your scalp as well that way it

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.170 
hair from your scalp as well that way it
kind<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:37.040> stays<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.430> place<00:03:37.640> catchers

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
kind of stays in place catchers

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.630 
kind of stays in place catchers
obviously<00:03:38.810> had<00:03:39.019> shorter<00:03:39.470> hair<00:03:39.500> than<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:40.069> do<00:03:40.129> and

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
obviously had shorter hair than I do and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.009 
obviously had shorter hair than I do and
I'm<00:03:40.760> sure<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.150> some<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:41.599> guys<00:03:41.720> watching

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
I'm sure that some of you guys watching

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.009 
I'm sure that some of you guys watching
have<00:03:42.410> longer<00:03:42.799> hair<00:03:42.830> than<00:03:43.160> me<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:44.299> think<00:03:44.690> that

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
have longer hair than me I think that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.050 
have longer hair than me I think that
you<00:03:45.170> could<00:03:45.410> probably<00:03:45.680> take<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.549> rest<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:46.940> this

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
you could probably take the rest of this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.600 
you could probably take the rest of this
hair<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.629> would<00:03:47.720> be<00:03:47.870> hanging<00:03:48.110> down<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.680> loop

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
hair that would be hanging down and loop

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.020 
hair that would be hanging down and loop
in<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.879> couple<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.390> times<00:03:50.629> if<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.079> wanted<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
in a couple of times if you wanted to it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.059 
in a couple of times if you wanted to it
might<00:03:53.329> be<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> way<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.959> you'd<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.440> kill<00:03:54.829> or

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
might be a way that you'd like kill or

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.770 
might be a way that you'd like kill or
eat<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.519> kills<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.090> eat<00:03:56.239> some<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.660> your

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
eat not kills and eat some of your

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.740 
eat not kills and eat some of your
length<00:03:56.989> up<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.430> think<00:03:58.579> with<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.269> rest<00:03:59.510> of

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
length up with I think with the rest of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.240 
length up with I think with the rest of
her<00:03:59.900> hair<00:04:00.079> she<00:04:00.319> had<00:04:00.410> a<00:04:00.500> shorter<00:04:00.859> amount<00:04:00.980> of

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
her hair she had a shorter amount of

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.210 
her hair she had a shorter amount of
hair<00:04:01.430> than<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.760> did<00:04:02.000> left<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.930> think<00:04:03.829> it<00:04:03.920> was<00:04:04.040> just

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
hair than I did left I think it was just

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580 
hair than I did left I think it was just
kind<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.549> split<00:04:05.480> like<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.290> sort<00:04:06.500> of

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
kind of split like this and I sort of

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.520 
kind of split like this and I sort of
talked<00:04:06.890> in<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:08.480> think<00:04:09.019> I'm<00:04:09.140> going<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.349> try

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
talked in and I think I'm going to try

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.050 
talked in and I think I'm going to try
and<00:04:09.769> do<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.040> with<00:04:10.099> my<00:04:10.400> own<00:04:10.579> hair<00:04:10.879> I'm<00:04:11.000> not

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and do that with my own hair I'm not

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.330 
and do that with my own hair I'm not
really<00:04:11.480> sure<00:04:11.599> if<00:04:11.720> it's<00:04:11.900> going<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.290> work<00:04:12.500> but

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
really sure if it's going to work but

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:28.160 
really sure if it's going to work but
I'm<00:04:13.579> gonna<00:04:13.879> give<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.269> shot

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.440 

she<00:04:29.170> had<00:04:29.410> her<00:04:29.560> braids<00:04:29.920> sort<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.430> pulls<00:04:30.700> back<00:04:31.030> I

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
she had her braids sort of pulls back I

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.810 
she had her braids sort of pulls back I
think<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.500> kind<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.800> ended<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.430> looked<00:04:33.640> as

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
think it kind of ended it looked as

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.420 
think it kind of ended it looked as
though<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.000> ended<00:04:34.600> when<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.440> met<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
though it ended when it met with the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.760 
though it ended when it met with the
knot<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> back<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:37.690> obviously<00:04:38.290> my<00:04:38.530> hair

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
knot in the back but obviously my hair

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.860 
knot in the back but obviously my hair
is<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:38.980> little<00:04:39.370> longer<00:04:39.550> at<00:04:39.790> least<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.630> look

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
is a little longer at least and so look

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.030 
is a little longer at least and so look
so<00:04:41.800> I'm<00:04:42.040> bringing<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.550> underneath<00:04:42.970> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
so I'm bringing it underneath the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.820 
so I'm bringing it underneath the
underneath<00:04:45.040> they're<00:04:45.340> not<00:04:46.260> going<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.350> pin<00:04:47.710> it

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
underneath they're not going to pin it

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.380 
underneath they're not going to pin it
I'll<00:04:48.640> just<00:04:48.670> wrap<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.420> around<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.840> rest<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.230> it

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
I'll just wrap it around the rest of it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.279 
I'll just wrap it around the rest of it
this<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.570> what<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.780> ends<00:04:53.140> up<00:04:53.230> looking<00:04:53.290> like

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.779 

as<00:05:00.289> I<00:05:00.500> said<00:05:00.710> my<00:05:00.919> hair's<00:05:01.160> longer<00:05:01.430> than<00:05:01.699> the

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
as I said my hair's longer than the

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.029 
as I said my hair's longer than the
actresses<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.389> I<00:05:02.720> think<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.289> it<00:05:03.590> kind<00:05:03.919> of

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
actresses and I think that it kind of

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.520 
actresses and I think that it kind of
posed<00:05:04.569> somewhat<00:05:05.569> of<00:05:05.660> an<00:05:05.750> issue<00:05:05.930> when<00:05:06.229> I<00:05:06.289> was

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
posed somewhat of an issue when I was

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.159 
posed somewhat of an issue when I was
doing<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.190> talk<00:05:07.599> whereas<00:05:08.599> I<00:05:08.720> think<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:09.050> if

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
doing the talk whereas I think that if

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.689 
doing the talk whereas I think that if
you<00:05:09.259> have<00:05:09.440> shorter<00:05:09.889> hair<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.310> going<00:05:10.430> to

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
you have shorter hair this is going to

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.749 
you have shorter hair this is going to
