hey there youtubers okay here we are

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.780 
hey there youtubers okay here we are
again<00:00:06.879> 2001<00:00:07.879> Subaru<00:00:08.389> Outback<00:00:08.510> and<00:00:09.790> another

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
again 2001 Subaru Outback and another

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.590 
again 2001 Subaru Outback and another
problem<00:00:11.389> and<00:00:11.780> that<00:00:11.840> is<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.650> Mac<00:00:13.610> sensor<00:00:14.150> I've

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
problem and that is the Mac sensor I've

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.710 
problem and that is the Mac sensor I've
been<00:00:14.869> getting<00:00:15.590> a<00:00:15.709> code<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.449> I'll<00:00:17.449> show<00:00:17.630> you

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
been getting a code and I'll show you

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.900 
been getting a code and I'll show you
the<00:00:17.840> code<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.500> show<00:00:19.099> you<00:00:19.189> how<00:00:19.279> to<00:00:19.339> fix<00:00:19.640> this

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
the code and show you how to fix this

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.950 
the code and show you how to fix this
I've<00:00:20.179> done<00:00:20.359> this<00:00:20.509> once<00:00:20.779> before<00:00:20.990> on<00:00:22.060> this<00:00:23.060> car

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
I've done this once before on this car

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.620 
I've done this once before on this car
and<00:00:24.349> somehow<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.460> knock<00:00:25.759> sensor<00:00:26.150> went<00:00:26.359> bad

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
and somehow the knock sensor went bad

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
and somehow the knock sensor went bad
again<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:27.560> okay<00:00:28.160> here<00:00:28.730> we<00:00:28.849> are<00:00:28.880> inside<00:00:29.810> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
again so okay here we are inside and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.210 
again so okay here we are inside and
here<00:00:31.609> are<00:00:31.759> what's<00:00:31.970> code<00:00:32.239> reader<00:00:33.010> start<00:00:34.010> with

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
here are what's code reader start with

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.340 
here are what's code reader start with
that<00:00:34.430> setup<00:00:35.530> let's<00:00:36.530> turn<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.800> car<00:00:37.010> on<00:00:38.350> you

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
that setup let's turn the car on you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.750 
that setup let's turn the car on you
don't<00:00:39.500> start<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.830> car<00:00:40.070> just<00:00:40.280> turn<00:00:40.490> it<00:00:40.580> to<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
don't start the car just turn it to the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.980 
don't start the car just turn it to the
on<00:00:40.790> position<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:42.850> hit<00:00:43.850> enter<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.450> this<00:00:44.780> one

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
on position and hit enter on this one

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.370 
on position and hit enter on this one
for<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.380> scan<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:47.180> it's<00:00:47.600> scanning<00:00:48.020> scanning

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
for the scan and it's scanning scanning

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:59.410 
for the scan and it's scanning scanning
scanning<00:00:56.680> codes<00:00:57.680> found<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.670> that's<00:00:59.210> that

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
scanning codes found one that's that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.060 
scanning codes found one that's that
first<00:00:59.660> line<00:01:01.270> and<00:01:02.830> read<00:01:03.830> code<00:01:05.890> okay

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
first line and read code okay

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.749 
first line and read code okay
and<00:01:07.159> it's<00:01:07.630> p0<00:01:08.630> 3<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.170> 5<00:01:10.119> which<00:01:11.119> is<00:01:11.149> generic<00:01:11.899> code

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and it's p0 3 to 5 which is generic code

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.279 
and it's p0 3 to 5 which is generic code
and<00:01:13.759> it<00:01:13.880> means<00:01:14.060> knock<00:01:14.390> sensor<00:01:14.780> number<00:01:15.079> one

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
and it means knock sensor number one

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.919 
and it means knock sensor number one
circuit<00:01:15.859> bank<00:01:16.070> one<00:01:16.369> or<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> single<00:01:17.090> sensor<00:01:17.450> is

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
circuit bank one or a single sensor is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.190 
circuit bank one or a single sensor is
not<00:01:18.859> functioning<00:01:19.429> properly<00:01:19.840> you<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.020> take

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
not functioning properly you just take

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.109 
not functioning properly you just take
off<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.590> air<00:01:21.770> box<00:01:21.950> which<00:01:22.340> I've<00:01:22.520> done<00:01:22.670> here

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
off the air box which I've done here

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.130 
off the air box which I've done here
it's<00:01:23.749> two<00:01:24.049> bolts<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:25.670> then<00:01:26.030> few<00:01:26.659> air<00:01:26.929> hoses

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's two bolts and then few air hoses

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.010 
it's two bolts and then few air hoses
you<00:01:27.409> have<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.829> take<00:01:28.009> off<00:01:28.689> really<00:01:29.689> pretty

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
you have to take off really pretty

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.379 
you have to take off really pretty
simple<00:01:30.469> there's<00:01:30.799> also<00:01:30.979> one<00:01:31.340> sensor<00:01:31.789> up<00:01:31.969> front

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
simple there's also one sensor up front

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.330 
simple there's also one sensor up front
which<00:01:33.139> you<00:01:33.289> have<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.530> pull<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:35.149> that's<00:01:35.689> it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
which you have to pull out and that's it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450 
which you have to pull out and that's it
and<00:01:37.600> obviously<00:01:38.600> undo<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.619> battery<00:01:39.979> negative

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and obviously undo the battery negative

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.489 
and obviously undo the battery negative
before<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.569> anything<00:01:41.869> on<00:01:42.439> this<00:01:43.179> and<00:01:44.499> I'm

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
before you do anything on this and I'm

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.249 
before you do anything on this and I'm
going<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.770> do<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.429> let's<00:01:46.880> get<00:01:47.719> rocking

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
going to do that and let's get rocking

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.889 
going to do that and let's get rocking
and<00:01:48.350> rolling

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
and rolling

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.080 
and rolling
ok<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.229> pretty<00:01:51.709> much<00:01:51.829> ready<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> swap

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
ok so pretty much ready to do the swap

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.889 
ok so pretty much ready to do the swap
and<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:57.560> way<00:01:57.740> down<00:01:57.920> here<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:59.420> really<00:01:59.720> hard

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
and it's way down here it's really hard

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:13.870 
and it's way down here it's really hard
to<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.200> but<00:02:00.590> you'll<00:02:01.100> see<00:02:01.399> it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.170 

you<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:19.940> get<00:02:20.940> your

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
you just got to get there get your

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
you just got to get there get your
wrench<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.810> somehow<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.650> directly

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
wrench on it somehow it is directly

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.850 
wrench on it somehow it is directly
under<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.420> throttle<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.560> cruise<00:02:31.830> control

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
under the throttle and cruise control

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.199 
under the throttle and cruise control
cables<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.690> having<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:35.060> u-joint

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
cables so having a little u-joint

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.370 
cables so having a little u-joint
deal<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:37.050> nice<00:02:39.739> there's<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.950> magic<00:02:41.540> okay<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
deal is nice there's the magic okay the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.990 
deal is nice there's the magic okay the
magic<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.069> connector<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:46.610> hopefully<00:02:47.610> let

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
magic on this connector is hopefully let

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.220 
magic on this connector is hopefully let
me<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> see<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:52.250> okay<00:02:54.170> there's<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
me see if we can see this okay there's a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.820 
me see if we can see this okay there's a
tab<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:56.580> side<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.209> does<00:02:57.510> nothing<00:02:57.989> this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
tab on this side it does nothing this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.330 
tab on this side it does nothing this
big<00:02:59.310> flat<00:02:59.640> side<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.750> real<00:03:00.959> tab<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.530> underneath

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
big flat side the real tab is underneath

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.280 
big flat side the real tab is underneath
right<00:03:03.030> here<00:03:03.230> right<00:03:04.230> by<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> wires<00:03:06.049> they<00:03:07.049> go<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
right here right by the wires they go to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.089 
right here right by the wires they go to
the<00:03:07.560> engine<00:03:08.599> side<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.680> push<00:03:11.069> down

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
the engine side of it and just push down

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.630 
the engine side of it and just push down
push<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.299> tab<00:03:12.890> towards<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> wires<00:03:14.250> right

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
push that tab towards the wires right

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.960 
push that tab towards the wires right
here<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:18.120> thing<00:03:18.390> comes<00:03:18.930> apart<00:03:19.970> so

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
here and then this thing comes apart so

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.060 
here and then this thing comes apart so
the<00:03:21.120> tab<00:03:21.329> is<00:03:21.570> right<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.959> this<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.440> piece

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
the tab is right on this little piece

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.309 
the tab is right on this little piece
right<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:25.590> interesting

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
right here that was interesting

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.229 
right here that was interesting
so<00:03:27.739> that's<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.220> one<00:03:28.580> thing<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:28.879> going<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.090> do

is just reach down in here and just kind
of<00:03:34.010> clean<00:03:34.370> off<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:35.209> stud<00:03:35.799> where<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:36.950> mounts

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
of clean off the stud where this mounts

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
of clean off the stud where this mounts
and<00:03:38.530> then<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:40.099> goes<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.549> how<00:03:40.879> does<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.239> go

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
and then this goes on how does this go

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.920 
and then this goes on how does this go
in<00:03:41.799> there's<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.890> little<00:03:43.159> beveled<00:03:43.579> side<00:03:43.909> on<00:03:44.720> this

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
in there's a little beveled side on this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.589 
in there's a little beveled side on this
thing<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.769> goes<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:48.290> flat<00:03:48.560> side<00:03:49.599> big

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
thing and that goes up the flat side big

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.580 
thing and that goes up the flat side big
flat<00:03:50.870> side<00:03:51.110> goes<00:03:51.349> down<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.750> then<00:03:54.079> this<00:03:54.349> bolt

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
flat side goes down and then this bolt

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.740 
flat side goes down and then this bolt
goes<00:03:54.829> through<00:03:54.859> it<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.780> now<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.769> hard<00:03:57.950> part

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
goes through it so now the hard part

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.420 
goes through it so now the hard part
getting<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.989> on

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430

so<00:06:09.560> in<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.800> connector<00:06:10.280> from<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:12.050> sensor

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.450 

goes<00:06:21.160> back<00:06:21.460> through<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:21.910> zip<00:06:22.270> tie<00:06:23.220> keep<00:06:24.220> that

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
goes back through the zip tie keep that

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.019 
goes back through the zip tie keep that
in<00:06:24.640> position

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:28.029 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.739 

and<00:06:28.509> then<00:06:28.629> the<00:06:28.779> plug<00:06:30.089> those<00:06:31.089> back<00:06:31.149> Hanna's

and then the plug those back Hanna's

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.390 
and then the plug those back Hanna's
before

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.840 

and<00:06:37.400> connect<00:06:38.270> it<00:06:38.419> up

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.640 

well<00:06:42.850> is<00:06:43.030> it<00:06:43.210> tight<00:06:43.449> tight<00:06:44.699> and<00:06:45.699> their<00:06:45.850> deaths

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
well is it tight tight and their deaths

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.330 
well is it tight tight and their deaths
done<00:06:47.650> complete<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.550> hope<00:06:48.870> so

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
done complete I hope so

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.110 
done complete I hope so
let's<00:06:51.340> go<00:06:51.490> check<00:06:51.729> okay<00:06:52.449> so<00:06:52.509> we<00:06:53.080> are<00:06:53.350> going<00:06:53.740> to

let's go check okay so we are going to

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.999 
let's go check okay so we are going to
exit<00:06:55.120> that<00:06:55.740> we're<00:06:56.740> going<00:06:56.860> to<00:06:56.919> erase<00:06:57.400> that<00:06:57.729> code

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
exit that we're going to erase that code

so<00:07:12.190> that's<00:07:12.520> exited<00:07:13.090> and<00:07:13.300> that's<00:07:14.260> done<00:07:14.699> now

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
so that's exited and that's done now

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
start the engine pull the code reader

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.370 
start the engine pull the code reader
first<00:07:25.860> on<00:07:26.860> there<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.960> start<00:07:28.960> up<00:07:29.110> the<00:07:29.139> engine

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 
and look at that no check engine light

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:42.620 
and look at that no check engine light
none<00:07:38.139> not<00:07:38.620> a<00:07:38.680> zip<00:07:39.509> that's<00:07:40.509> what<00:07:40.780> I<00:07:40.840> like<00:07:41.020> to<00:07:41.199> see

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
none not a zip that's what I like to see

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.010 
none not a zip that's what I like to see
okay<00:07:43.630> all<00:07:43.930> good<00:07:44.199> stuff<00:07:44.530> so<00:07:45.430> that's<00:07:45.850> it<00:07:46.120> doable
