00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
something we haven't gotten is a sheeter
in<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.720> color<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.590> it'd<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.040> cool

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
in this color I think it'd be very cool

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
in this color I think it'd be very cool
to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.759> even<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> halo<00:01:33.450> 4<00:01:33.780> shade<00:01:34.470> turned

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to get even like a halo 4 shade turned

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840 
to get even like a halo 4 shade turned
that'd<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.950> pretty<00:01:35.100> cool<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.490> well

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that'd be pretty cool as well

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
that'd be pretty cool as well
I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.869> shade<00:01:37.200> drive<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.530> Halo<00:01:37.799> 3<00:01:38.040> was

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
I think this shade drive from Halo 3 was

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
I think this shade drive from Halo 3 was
very<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.150> awesome<00:01:39.360> especially<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.619> this

color<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.689> think<00:01:42.689> it'd<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.840> great

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
color right here I think it'd be great

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830 
color right here I think it'd be great

number eight this is the spirit from
Halo<00:01:48.899> Reach<00:01:49.250> there's<00:01:50.250> been<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> prototype<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
Halo Reach there's been a prototype of a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
Halo Reach there's been a prototype of a
spirit<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:51.899> yeah<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.290> never<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

would love to see spirit especially with
some<00:01:56.490> awesome<00:01:56.700> fears<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> said<00:01:57.780> itself

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
some awesome fears but as I said itself

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
some awesome fears but as I said itself
I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.710> really<00:01:58.920> cool<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.310> first<00:01:59.520> as

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I think would be really cool as first as

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.469 
I think would be really cool as first as
a<00:01:59.820> display<00:02:00.210> piece

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a display piece

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
a display piece
we<00:02:01.229> haven't<00:02:01.409> gotten<00:02:01.619> many<00:02:01.829> covenant<00:02:02.369> ships

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
we haven't gotten many covenant ships

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.819 
we haven't gotten many covenant ships
the<00:02:03.299> biggest<00:02:03.630> covenant<00:02:04.049> ship<00:02:04.140> we've<00:02:04.530> gotten

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the biggest covenant ship we've gotten

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.459 
the biggest covenant ship we've gotten
is<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.280> Phantom<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:07.290> might<00:02:07.409> be

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is the Phantom I think there might be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.900 
is the Phantom I think there might be
something<00:02:07.740> else<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.069> can't<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.670> remember

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
ourself ahead but the spirit would be

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.600 
ourself ahead but the spirit would be
very<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.160> awesome

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you can see sometimes in Halo 3 and it

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.370 
you can see sometimes in Halo 3 and it
is<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.890> elites<00:02:23.310> phantom<00:02:24.170> seriously<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.290> the

elites pilot and stuff and it was

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.420 
elites pilot and stuff and it was
awesome<00:02:27.030> looking<00:02:27.570> very<00:02:28.140> cool<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:29.340> would

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
awesome looking very cool I think would

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.820 
awesome looking very cool I think would
be<00:02:29.460> absolutely<00:02:30.390> amazing<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.050> got<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.560> as

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
be absolutely amazing if we got this as

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.790 
be absolutely amazing if we got this as
a<00:02:31.860> sick<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:33.750> here's<00:02:33.930> number<00:02:34.200> 6<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
a sick all right so here's number 6 and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950 
a sick all right so here's number 6 and
I<00:02:35.310> think<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.550> spirit<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.030> fire<00:02:36.240> would<00:02:36.570> be<00:02:36.660> very

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
I think a spirit of fire would be very

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.500 
I think a spirit of fire would be very
very<00:02:37.170> cool<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:38.100> are<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> UNSC<00:02:38.760> infinity<00:02:38.850> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
very cool this are the UNSC infinity I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.110 
very cool this are the UNSC infinity I
think<00:02:39.810> either<00:02:39.990> one<00:02:40.260> would<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.880> very<00:02:41.880> very

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
think either one would be very very

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.850 
think either one would be very very
awesome<00:02:42.300> any<00:02:42.690> spirit<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.080> fire<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.590> key

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
awesome any spirit of fire is more key

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.200 
awesome any spirit of fire is more key
and<00:02:44.040> Hailey<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.370> versa<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.850> would<00:02:45.030> make<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
and Hailey and versa this would make a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.840 
and Hailey and versa this would make a
little<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.540> sense<00:02:46.070> alright<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.280> number<00:02:47.460> five

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
little more sense alright so number five

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.450 
little more sense alright so number five
I<00:02:48.300> think<00:02:48.840> red<00:02:49.080> versus<00:02:49.440> blue<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.860> Ragnarok

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
I think red versus blue on Ragnarok

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.090 
I think red versus blue on Ragnarok
that'd<00:02:50.820> be<00:02:50.970> awesome<00:02:51.120> or<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.930> Ragnarok<00:02:52.830> set

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
that'd be awesome or just a Ragnarok set

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.950 
that'd be awesome or just a Ragnarok set
in<00:02:53.190> general<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.760> think<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.570> might<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.870> getting

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
in general I think we might be getting

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.350 
in general I think we might be getting
one<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.290> these<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.590> futures<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.400> it's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
one of these in the futures because it's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.020 
one of these in the futures because it's
been<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.350> much<00:02:58.500> asked<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:59.100> asked<00:02:59.730> for<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
been so so much asked for asked for it
