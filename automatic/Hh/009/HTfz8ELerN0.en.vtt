00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.759
 creepy to peel off 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.799
 so what is my tendency to fat 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.720
 100 last rome I used a mask 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.190
 everyone knows her too and find it somehow 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.530
 dries the t-zone know this is one of not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.390
 many clay masks on this basis, 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.970
 which should dry up while you are her 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.459
 use which does not cause special 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.170
 such straightness and dryness that me 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.930
 very happy that it is quite possible 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.060
 use even longer hold than 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.170
 indicated your face will not turn such 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.600
 dried raisin 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 but then she is very so laying gentle 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.620
 you feel a sense of purity 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.739
 somehow the mask did work and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.049
 cleaned up maybe pores like that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.180
 skin condition has improved and I already 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.730
 telling favorites and in such a mask from 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 Avon from the solution winter care series 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.350
 moisturizing gel mask I use it 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.830
 when i urgently need to teach my face 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.040
 the order 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.500
 let's say i'm more real person here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.329
 the pillars up to the earth are passionately colored then 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.940
 I literally put it on for 10 minutes she 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.340
 just is like a cream that is nothing 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.650
 there is no she does not dry up mom 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 her cool water and really skin 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.489
 somehow it becomes more certain 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.890
 more childish some pig 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.519
 the next stage is some kind of tonics 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 for face 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.840
 and I also have 2 now only thin 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.049
 one is a hundred recipes beauty moisturizing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 and freshness scarlet pink model adore 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.660
 tonic it perfectly refreshes the skin perfectly 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 removes any makeup residues which 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.170
 God forbid I have not washed away 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.820
 2 tonic and it is also his plan Kataev 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.569
 mother presented a series of solution 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.879
 this tonic is already moisturizing 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.489
 after using it feelings and 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.139
 moisturizing on my face I feel that 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.590
 not just wiped like a cotton pad 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.420
 oh really face when i fed my 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.040
 damiano face skin from all very bad 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.579
 what is rash 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.159
 I instead of tonic very rarely I do 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.849
 using chlorhexidine just pouring on 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.349
 basic disc wipe very well 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.609
 disinfects this remedy and faster 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.290
 dries pimples 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.150
 so let's tell you a little bit with you 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.459
 course often when my skin 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.290
 chernitsa starts somehow too strong 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.969
 I use just such an emulsion from Alla 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.079
 for normal and oily skin 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:10.870
 she is very light very weightless and not 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.239
 gives such an obvious food as me 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.289
 it seems she just removes from my face 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.780
 feelings of tightness and when i know that 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.060
 my skin in the rank of the day may somewhere over 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.759
 get fat somehow betrayed then I 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.500
 I use exactly this emulsion also 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.139
 relatively recently there are literally three 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.360
 weeks I use this cream from 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.960
 garnier basic care cover money 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.880
 composed 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.889
 and even though this cream is so light 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.620
 it is completely matte effect is not 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.990
 tightens the skin does not listen to her 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.000
 and instantly absorbed that very 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.759
 comfortable in the morning and he does an excellent job with 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.620
 his task does not shine my face but 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.139
 while it does not feel how 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.909
 we are overdried by some sting also with 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.650
 am according to the first make up I 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.780
 I put some cream under my eyes 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.759
 special and i need here too 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.590
 something so easy for him to 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.639
 I was quickly absorbed and I could immediately 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.039
 start makeup 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.120
 I often use it a lot in practice. 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.090
 one hundred percent of the cases 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.070
 cream from a clean line light cream for eyelids 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.650

 nick that does nothing he does not clean 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.910
 there is no wrinkles swell carry 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.670
 i would just use as a barrier between 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.470
 skin and concealer and final basics 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.940
 if i say okay or she 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.830
 on the contrary kaptep dryness and more 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.350
 leans that i used such a cream 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.320
 from it, too, the solution series is called 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.540
 healthy radiance is a moisturizer and in 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.610
 it accommodate them most often the smallest 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.890
 particles of some tonal means 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.950
 when I wear this brand these little ones 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.540
 pieces like you burst on your face and 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.250
 visually level the skin very 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.890
 I like how this cream works 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.230
 what does he do surs dear and i can even 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.750
 Do not put toner there powder just 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.850
 apply it and already the skin becomes very 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.530
 even such a decent very decent 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.570
 last thing I have left for you 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.940
 tell it your own darkly coming out also 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.100
 before applying it I wash off as 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.100
 newbies most likely soap up 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.890
 toning as he way tonic and then 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.590
 Apply either such a cream is avon 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.720
 solutions winter care night cream he 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.460
 very well respected very well 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.040
 eat when and in the morning after it 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.780
 wake up that skin is nourished and he doesn't 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
 stays on the pillow accordingly i 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.340
 I am sure that all night I had on my face 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.170
 cream and all night he somehow worked fed 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.450
 I also have this from this series 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.780
 day cream and since winter is over 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.700
 It has become quite warm it for a day 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.310
 he is still too heavy for me therefore I 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.400
 I am beginning to use it as a night in 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.540
 these two creams are absolutely practically 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.640
 identical properties to me even at one time 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.220
 it seemed that daytime is more bold than 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.860
 night difference seems to me in these creams 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.560
 only that day cream has 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.240
 still spf20 it perfectly protects from such 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.070
 strong bright sun which 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.170
 occasionally it happens with us but even so 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.820
 I use several means before bedtime 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.800
 for the eye area 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.620
 the first is more understandable and that 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.550
 remedy for avon solution also gel for 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.910
 skin around the eyes 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.930
 I keep it in the fridge so that it still 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.370
 more I struggled with bags of edema 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.259
 noticed that all night I really 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.720
 sleep and this time look for me look 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.690

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.870
 eyes i use such retinol ampoule 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.639
 and these are the ampoules of vitamin and not their appearance 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.880
 can only be used at night because 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.889
 that during the day they can cause pigment 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.009
 spots under my eyes I pierce either 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.050
 retinol capsule I either fly with a and 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:32.610
 I apply what came out so oily 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.490
 eye base 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.530
 need to do this 2 c in two hours at least 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.300
 before sleep so that everything is so absorbed since i 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.919
