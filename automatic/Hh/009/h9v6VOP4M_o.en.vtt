cement can hurt safety bolts is a great
way<00:00:21.110> to<00:00:21.140> begin<00:00:21.560> learning<00:00:22.310> vaulting<00:00:22.939> because

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
way to begin learning vaulting because

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.140 
way to begin learning vaulting because
you're<00:00:23.509> using<00:00:23.750> your<00:00:24.020> foot<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.500> kind<00:00:24.740> of<00:00:24.830> help

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
you're using your foot to kind of help

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.089 
you're using your foot to kind of help
use<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.300> as<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.630> kick<00:00:27.200> to<00:00:27.410> get<00:00:27.529> yourself<00:00:27.919> over

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
use it as a kick to get yourself over

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.720 
use it as a kick to get yourself over
not<00:00:28.789> only<00:00:29.029> can<00:00:29.210> it<00:00:29.329> be<00:00:29.360> used<00:00:29.750> as<00:00:29.990> a<00:00:30.439> way<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.010> help

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
not only can it be used as a way to help

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.670 
not only can it be used as a way to help
you<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.029> learning<00:00:32.180> about<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.199> think<00:00:33.230> it<00:00:33.530> can

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
you in learning about but I think it can

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.009 
you in learning about but I think it can
be<00:00:33.800> used<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.370> add<00:00:34.640> some<00:00:34.910> style<00:00:35.210> or<00:00:35.420> flash<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.960> it

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
be used to add some style or flash to it

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.320 
be used to add some style or flash to it
as<00:00:36.140> well<00:00:36.460> so<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.550> first<00:00:37.790> thing<00:00:37.970> you<00:00:38.059> want<00:00:38.269> to

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
as well so the first thing you want to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.360 
as well so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:41.260> you<00:00:42.260> want<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.500> know<00:00:42.650> which<00:00:42.890> foot<00:00:43.160> you're

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
do you want to know which foot you're

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.670 
do you want to know which foot you're
going<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.699> be<00:00:43.820> placing<00:00:44.120> on<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.540> rail<00:00:44.720> and<00:00:45.050> then

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
going to be placing on the rail and then

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.049 
going to be placing on the rail and then
which<00:00:46.160> hand<00:00:46.399> you're<00:00:46.550> going<00:00:46.700> to<00:00:46.789> be<00:00:46.879> using

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
which hand you're going to be using

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.150 
which hand you're going to be using
because<00:00:47.870> after<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.289> it's<00:00:48.500> simply<00:00:48.800> putting

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
because after that it's simply putting

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.549 
because after that it's simply putting
your<00:00:49.309> foot<00:00:49.430> on<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.730> rail<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.510> bringing<00:00:51.440> your

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
your foot on the rail and bringing your

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.060 
your foot on the rail and bringing your
other<00:00:51.680> leg<00:00:51.920> through<00:00:53.590> as<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:54.680> start<00:00:54.920> getting

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
other leg through as you start getting

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.920 
other leg through as you start getting
comfortable<00:00:55.370> with<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.000> ball<00:00:56.180> you'll<00:00:56.690> want<00:00:56.870> to

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
comfortable with the ball you'll want to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.209 
comfortable with the ball you'll want to
start<00:00:57.199> learning<00:00:57.379> kind<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.800> doing<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.039> little

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
start learning kind of doing a little

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.110 
start learning kind of doing a little
bit<00:00:58.460> faster

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
bit faster

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.720 
bit faster
as<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.629> take<00:00:59.840> it<00:00:59.989> faster<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.559> faster<00:01:00.739> you'll

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
as you take it faster and faster you'll

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.670 
as you take it faster and faster you'll
be<00:01:01.910> able<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.329> feel<00:01:02.899> more<00:01:03.079> confident<00:01:03.620> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
be able to feel more confident and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.620 
be able to feel more confident and
comfortable<00:01:03.890> with<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.030> eventually<00:01:05.479> get

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
comfortable with it and eventually get

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.120 
comfortable with it and eventually get
into<00:01:05.869> other<00:01:06.020> vaults<00:01:06.350> where<00:01:06.590> you're<00:01:06.710> not<00:01:06.830> even

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
into other vaults where you're not even

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.670 
into other vaults where you're not even
using<00:01:07.820> your<00:01:08.000> foot<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.600> also<00:01:08.869> like<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.350> apply<00:01:09.619> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
using your foot I also like to apply the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.469 
using your foot I also like to apply the
same<00:01:09.800> type<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.310> concept<00:01:10.670> when<00:01:11.060> learning<00:01:11.330> other

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
same type of concept when learning other

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.630 
same type of concept when learning other
bolts<00:01:11.899> I'll<00:01:12.410> show<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.679> some<00:01:12.920> examples<00:01:13.520> of<00:01:13.580> how

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
bolts I'll show you some examples of how

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.300 
bolts I'll show you some examples of how
the<00:01:13.820> same<00:01:14.410> principle<00:01:15.410> can<00:01:15.619> be<00:01:15.649> applied<00:01:16.070> to

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
the same principle can be applied to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.100 
the same principle can be applied to
other<00:01:16.910> blocks<00:01:17.270> you'll<00:01:17.509> be<00:01:17.630> learning<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
other blocks you'll be learning in the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.450 
other blocks you'll be learning in the
future

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.250 

and<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.880> safety<00:01:26.119> vault<00:01:26.390> remember

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
and that is the safety vault remember

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.719 
and that is the safety vault remember
you<00:01:27.409> can<00:01:27.560> implement<00:01:27.830> any<00:01:28.190> of<00:01:28.340> these<00:01:28.430> moves

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
you can implement any of these moves

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.940 
you can implement any of these moves
into<00:01:29.060> your<00:01:29.090> assassinations<00:01:29.930> might<00:01:30.530> be<00:01:30.680> best

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
into your assassinations might be best

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.500 
into your assassinations might be best
if<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.190> practice<00:01:31.610> with<00:01:31.880> someone<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.210> little

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
if you practice with someone a little

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.070 
if you practice with someone a little
bit<00:01:32.659> smaller<00:01:32.960> than<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.320> first<00:01:33.619> though<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.460> oh

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
bit smaller than you first though so oh

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.800 
bit smaller than you first though so oh
I've<00:01:36.080> got<00:01:36.259> someone<00:01:36.530> right<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:37.659> check<00:01:38.659> this

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
I've got someone right here check this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.020 
I've got someone right here check this
out
