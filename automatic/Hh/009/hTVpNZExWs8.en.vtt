00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.089 
we've got a bit of a not the best video
camera<00:00:06.089> so<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.299> focus<00:00:06.629> tends<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> go<00:00:07.109> out<00:00:07.290> but

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
camera so the focus tends to go out but

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.200

he has a full view where you can

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.480 
he has a full view where you can
actually<00:00:09.510> see<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> controls<00:00:10.260> as<00:00:10.410> well<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.830> on

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
actually see the controls as well and on

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.850 
actually see the controls as well and on
the<00:00:11.820> control<00:00:12.210> panel<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:13.320> can<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.799> we

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the control panel you can see how we

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
the control panel you can see how we
control<00:00:14.309> all<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.490> points<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> little

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
control all the points with the little

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.900 
control all the points with the little
switcher<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> toggle<00:00:17.760> switch

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
switcher so it's just a toggle switch

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.939 
switcher so it's just a toggle switch
you<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.300> flick<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.900> down<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.350> then

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you just flick it up or down and then

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.410 
you just flick it up or down and then
you<00:00:20.100> push<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> button<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> actually<00:00:21.090> set<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you push the button to actually set it

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880 
you push the button to actually set it
and<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.600> depends<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.560> track

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and that depends if you want the track

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.660 
and that depends if you want the track
so<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.060> example<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.810> over<00:00:25.050> here

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
so for example this one over here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
so for example this one over here
controls<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.359> one<00:00:27.599> over<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.230> join

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
controls this one over here this join

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.189 
controls this one over here this join
here<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> track<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.869> if

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
here and if you want the track to go if

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
here and if you want the track to go if
you<00:00:31.289> want<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> train<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.920> come<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.399> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you want the train to come from this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
you want the train to come from this
side<00:00:32.820> then<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.930> toggle<00:00:34.230> switch<00:00:34.350> needs<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> be

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
side then this toggle switch needs to be

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.319 
side then this toggle switch needs to be
in<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.219> position<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
in the up position which it is if you

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
in the up position which it is if you
wanted<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> come<00:00:36.840> down<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:38.129> come<00:00:38.160> onto<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
wanted to come down to come onto that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.310 
wanted to come down to come onto that
track<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> needs<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> down

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
track but it needs to be in the down

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170 
track but it needs to be in the down
position<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.910> set<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
position and then to actually set the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
position and then to actually set the
point<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.840> push<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> red<00:00:43.379> button

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
point you actually push this red button

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.060 
point you actually push this red button
so<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> push<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.539> red<00:00:45.690> button<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> will

so when I push that red button you will
see<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> point<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.239> change<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.660> I'll

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
see that the point will change so I'll

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810 
see that the point will change so I'll
push<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.980> you'll<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.610> clicked

onto<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> turntable<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.390> stop<00:01:39.630> over

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
onto the turntable and will stop over

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
onto the turntable and will stop over
there<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.310> flick<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.579> switch

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
there and then we just flick the switch

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.020 
there and then we just flick the switch
around<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.040> we'll<00:01:44.159> make<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> turntable

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
around and then we'll make the turntable

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
around and then we'll make the turntable
spin<00:01:45.210> around<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> turntable

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
spin around as you can see the turntable

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.760 
spin around as you can see the turntable
spinning

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
spinning

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
spinning
now<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.830> turntable<00:01:50.550> is<00:01:50.760> lined<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.480> with<00:01:51.690> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now the turntable is lined up with a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.490 
now the turntable is lined up with a
main<00:01:51.990> track

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
main track

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.310 
main track
so<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.830> just<00:01:53.070> turn<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.550> off<00:01:53.730> then<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so I just turn that off then all I do is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
so I just turn that off then all I do is
I<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.590> turn<00:01:55.800> this<00:01:55.950> knob<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.430> you'll<00:01:56.520> watch

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I just turn this knob and you'll watch

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
I just turn this knob and you'll watch
the<00:01:56.850> local<00:01:57.150> will<00:01:57.300> accelerate<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.050> go<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the local will accelerate here we go the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.840 
the local will accelerate here we go the
locos<00:01:59.820> comes<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:01.160> now<00:02:02.160> when<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.370> loco<00:02:02.640> gets

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
locos comes down now when the loco gets

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.010 
locos comes down now when the loco gets
down<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.300> point<00:02:03.510> over<00:02:03.660> here<00:02:03.870> it's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
down to this point over here it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.090 
down to this point over here it's
actually<00:02:04.260> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.440> stop<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:04.980> it's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually going to stop because it's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.500 
actually going to stop because it's
controlled<00:02:05.460> by<00:02:05.580> different<00:02:06.000> control<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:06.480> you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
controlled by different control so you

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.420 
controlled by different control so you
can<00:02:06.660> see<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.900> just<00:02:06.930> stopped<00:02:07.260> there<00:02:07.440> even

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
can see it just stopped there even

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.370 
can see it just stopped there even
though<00:02:08.580> I've<00:02:08.850> got<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.149> control<00:02:09.540> turned<00:02:10.200> all

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
though I've got the control turned all

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.140 
though I've got the control turned all
the<00:02:10.470> way<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.070> any<00:02:11.190> further<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the way up can go any further if I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.970 
the way up can go any further if I
reverse<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.720> by<00:02:13.110> flicking<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.530> switch<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.890> will

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
reverse it by flicking a switch it will

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.690 
reverse it by flicking a switch it will
go<00:02:14.100> back<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.600> if<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.780> bring<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> forward<00:02:16.700> it'll

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
go back and if I bring it forward it'll

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
go back and if I bring it forward it'll
come<00:02:17.880> down<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.450> it'll<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.530> stop<00:02:19.710> there<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
come down and it'll just stop there so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
come down and it'll just stop there so
now<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> control<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.970> next<00:02:21.420> section<00:02:21.600> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
now to control this next section of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.600 
now to control this next section of
track<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> middle<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:22.830> you've<00:02:23.490> got

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
track which is the middle one you've got

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.190 
track which is the middle one you've got
to<00:02:23.700> use<00:02:23.820> this<00:02:24.000> control<00:02:24.390> here<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.080> got

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
to use this control here so what you got

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
to use this control here so what you got
to<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.440> you've<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.710> flick<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.130> so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to do is you've got to flick this so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.190 
to do is you've got to flick this so
we'll<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.120> turn<00:02:27.270> out<00:02:27.420> -<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:27.960> there's<00:02:28.110> no

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
we'll just turn out - so there's no

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.330 
we'll just turn out - so there's no
speed<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.160> track<00:02:29.400> has<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.640> be<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:31.340> in

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
speed the track has to be in that in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.940 
speed the track has to be in that in
that<00:02:32.550> position<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.440> just<00:02:34.440> give<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.680> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
that position there and just give it a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
that position there and just give it a
little<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.340> acceleration<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.690> all<00:02:36.900> four

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
little bit acceleration and all four

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.600 
little bit acceleration and all four
loko<00:02:37.290> goes<00:02:37.500> now<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.740> need<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.160> remember<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
loko goes now we need to remember to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820 
loko goes now we need to remember to
change<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.030> point<00:02:39.330> because<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.470> train<00:02:40.740> is

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
change this point because the train is

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.870 
change this point because the train is
going<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.040> come<00:02:41.190> around<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
going to come around and it's going to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.580 
going to come around and it's going to
come<00:02:42.030> onto<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.360> track<00:02:42.660> here<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.320> over

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
come onto this track here so we go over

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.950 
come onto this track here so we go over
here<00:02:43.820> click<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> switch<00:02:45.150> push<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> button

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
here click the switch push the button

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.200 
here click the switch push the button
and<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.950> point<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.430> changed<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.150> now

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and that point is just changed and now

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.640 
and that point is just changed and now
the<00:02:48.270> train<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.780> go<00:02:48.930> without<00:02:49.200> derail

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the train will go without derail

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.240 
the train will go without derail
engineer<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.280> see<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.810> goes

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
engineer you can see and off it goes

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
engineer you can see and off it goes
there<00:02:53.250> she<00:02:53.280> goes<00:02:53.550> around<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.970> track<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:55.080> what

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
there she goes around the track and what

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.770 
there she goes around the track and what
I<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.160> speed<00:02:56.610> her<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.730> turn<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I can do is I can speed her up turn the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.110 
I can do is I can speed her up turn the
knob<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> then<00:02:59.130> she<00:02:59.280> go<00:02:59.430> faster<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.030> that's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
knob and then she go faster and that's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.199 
knob and then she go faster and that's
full<00:03:00.360> speed<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:02.459> we'll<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.730> we'll<00:03:02.910> bring<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
full speed what we'll do we'll bring it

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.840 
full speed what we'll do we'll bring it
around<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.690> we'll<00:03:03.780> slow<00:03:04.020> her<00:03:04.170> down

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
around and then we'll slow her down

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.220 
around and then we'll slow her down
so<00:03:05.850> I'll<00:03:05.940> start<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.270> slow<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.570> down<00:03:06.600> now<00:03:06.750> just

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
so I'll start to slow it down now just

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.940 
so I'll start to slow it down now just
turn<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> knob

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
turn the knob

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.920 
turn the knob
slow<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.400> down<00:03:08.610> there<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.030> go<00:03:09.150> we'll<00:03:09.330> stop<00:03:09.570> it

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
slow that down there we go we'll stop it

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.920 
slow that down there we go we'll stop it
flick<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.800> switch<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:12.150> put<00:03:12.330> her<00:03:12.390> into<00:03:12.600> reverse

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
flick the switch to put her into reverse

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.760 
flick the switch to put her into reverse
and<00:03:12.959> what<00:03:13.260> we're<00:03:13.350> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.620> we're<00:03:13.739> going

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
and what we're going to do we're going

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.229 
and what we're going to do we're going
to<00:03:13.890> come<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.190> pick<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.459> these<00:03:14.610> two<00:03:14.790> carriages

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
to come and pick up these two carriages

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.360 
to come and pick up these two carriages
so<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.020> do<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.290> we've<00:03:16.709> got<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> change<00:03:16.980> these

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
so to do that we've got to change these

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.940 
so to do that we've got to change these
points<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:18.989> over<00:03:19.230> here<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.650> can<00:03:19.800> see

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
points so we go over here and we can see

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.470 
points so we go over here and we can see
that's<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.310> switch<00:03:20.489> there<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.209> flip<00:03:21.420> it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that's the switch there so you flip it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.960 
that's the switch there so you flip it
up<00:03:21.989> push<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.950> button<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.430> when<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> push<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
up push the button and when I push the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.420 
up push the button and when I push the
button<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.330> point<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.720> change<00:03:25.130> there<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.250> go

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
button the point will change there we go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.330 
button the point will change there we go
and<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.350> it's<00:03:28.350> already<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:28.800> reverse<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and now it's already in reverse I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.070 
and now it's already in reverse I
flicked<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> switch<00:03:29.760> turn<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.690> up<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.959> you'll

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
flicked the switch turn it up and you'll

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.120 
flicked the switch turn it up and you'll
see<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.410> goes<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.739> loca<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:33.060> she<00:03:33.360> comes

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
see there goes the loca and she comes

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.470 
see there goes the loca and she comes
and<00:03:35.130> she's<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.580> pick<00:03:35.760> up<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.060> carriage

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and she's going to pick up that carriage

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.850 
and she's going to pick up that carriage
bump<00:03:37.050> these<00:03:37.440> years

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
bump these years

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.030 
bump these years
put<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.610> loco<00:03:38.910> back<00:03:39.120> into<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.480> forward<00:03:40.050> or

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
put the loco back into you forward or

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.199 
put the loco back into you forward or
she<00:03:41.250> goes

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
she goes

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.459 
she goes
and<00:03:43.329> then<00:03:43.450> she's<00:03:43.629> got<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.049> now<00:03:44.170> we've<00:03:44.349> got

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
and then she's got it and now we've got

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.800 
and then she's got it and now we've got
to<00:03:44.530> remember<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.950> fit<00:03:45.159> that<00:03:45.340> back<00:03:45.599> we<00:03:46.599> come

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
to remember to fit that back we come

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.110 
to remember to fit that back we come
back<00:03:46.989> put<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.799> switch<00:03:48.159> down<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.459> there

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
back put the switch down to there

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.390 
back put the switch down to there
flick<00:03:49.599> it<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:50.349> now<00:03:50.500> it'll<00:03:50.769> do<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.069> complete

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
flick it and now it'll do the complete

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.899 
flick it and now it'll do the complete
loop<00:03:52.620> I'll<00:03:53.620> accelerate<00:03:54.099> it<00:03:54.400> up<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.579> little<00:03:54.700> bit

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
loop I'll accelerate it up a little bit

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.800 
loop I'll accelerate it up a little bit
there<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.629> can<00:03:55.810> see<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.019> guy<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:57.780> away<00:03:58.780> she

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
there you can see a guy and away she

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.209 
there you can see a guy and away she
goes<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.230> we<00:03:59.319> can<00:03:59.469> do<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.680> same<00:03:59.829> thing<00:04:00.129> and

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
goes and we can do the same thing and

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.500 
goes and we can do the same thing and
come<00:04:00.400> back<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.700> fish<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.000> everyone<00:04:01.359> but

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
come back and fish that everyone but

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.360 
come back and fish that everyone but
it'll<00:04:01.689> take<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> bit<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.109> time<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:03.189> won't

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
it'll take a bit of time so you won't

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.339 
it'll take a bit of time so you won't
bother<00:04:03.549> with<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.849> now<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.810> bring<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.139> on<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
bother with that now to bring it on the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.280 
bother with that now to bring it on the
outside<00:04:05.709> track<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.159> just<00:04:06.340> bring<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.519> along<00:04:07.290> we

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
outside track you just bring it along we

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.720 
outside track you just bring it along we
can<00:04:08.409> just<00:04:08.590> stop<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.920> all<00:04:09.159> I've<00:04:09.310> done<00:04:09.430> I'll<00:04:09.609> just

can just stop it all I've done I'll just

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.789 
can just stop it all I've done I'll just
turn<00:04:09.879> that<00:04:09.909> down<00:04:10.120> put<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.139> in<00:04:11.230> reverse

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
turn that down put it in reverse

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.709 
turn that down put it in reverse
now<00:04:12.310> we<00:04:12.370> need<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.670> change<00:04:12.909> this<00:04:13.120> sitting<00:04:13.480> here

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
now we need to change this sitting here

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.360 
now we need to change this sitting here
so<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.290> track<00:04:14.530> will<00:04:14.680> come<00:04:14.829> on<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.099> this<00:04:15.189> one

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
so the track will come on to this one

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.430 
so the track will come on to this one
hold<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.090> one<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:17.019> come<00:04:17.169> over<00:04:17.199> here

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
hold on to that one so we come over here

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.800 
hold on to that one so we come over here
this<00:04:18.160> is<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.459> one<00:04:18.579> here<00:04:18.759> a<00:04:18.789> flick<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.359> down

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
this is the one here a flick it down

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050 
this is the one here a flick it down
push<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> red<00:04:20.979> button<00:04:21.009> you<00:04:21.609> hear<00:04:21.759> a<00:04:21.789> click

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
push the red button you hear a click

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.439 
push the red button you hear a click
click<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.800> that's<00:04:23.979> now<00:04:24.160> set<00:04:24.460> now<00:04:25.150> we<00:04:25.210> just

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
click so that's now set now we just

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.780 
click so that's now set now we just
accelerate

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.380 

there<00:04:31.420> are<00:04:31.540> guys<00:04:32.250> sometimes<00:04:33.250> sometimes<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
there are guys sometimes sometimes it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
there are guys sometimes sometimes it
gets<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.840> little<00:04:34.900> bit's<00:04:35.230> back<00:04:35.470> ah

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.020 

the<00:04:38.950> reason<00:04:39.220> it's<00:04:39.340> got<00:04:39.430> stuck<00:04:39.640> is<00:04:39.760> because

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
the reason it's got stuck is because

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.070 
the reason it's got stuck is because
we've<00:04:40.120> got<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.300> go<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.540> other<00:04:40.660> control

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
we've got to go to the other control

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.680 
we've got to go to the other control
okay<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.950> go<00:04:42.040> any<00:04:42.160> other<00:04:42.280> control<00:04:42.550> we<00:04:43.480> just

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
okay so to go any other control we just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.630 
okay so to go any other control we just
flick<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.230> switch<00:04:44.470> there<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:45.220> go<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.520> there

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
flick that switch there you go so there

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.710 
flick that switch there you go so there
was<00:04:45.730> actually<00:04:45.790> no<00:04:46.060> reason<00:04:46.240> for<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.600> good

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
was actually no reason for the good

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.780 
was actually no reason for the good
stuff<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:47.560> we'll<00:04:47.710> just<00:04:47.800> stop<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.010> day<00:04:48.310> we've<00:04:48.670> got

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
stuff so we'll just stop a day we've got

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.230 
stuff so we'll just stop a day we've got
to<00:04:48.880> change<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.210> point<00:04:49.480> back<00:04:49.720> we<00:04:50.710> come<00:04:50.920> along

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
to change the point back we come along
