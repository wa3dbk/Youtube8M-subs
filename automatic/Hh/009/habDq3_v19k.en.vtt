cool this horse does also come with an
extra<00:03:06.170> whoa<00:03:06.859> brick<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.799> to<00:03:09.980> look<00:03:10.160> just

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
extra whoa brick for it to look just

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.960 
extra whoa brick for it to look just
like<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.870> regular<00:03:11.870> horse<00:03:12.319> instead<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.910> having<00:03:13.910> a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
like a regular horse instead of having a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.110 
like a regular horse instead of having a
chunk<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.989> missing<00:03:15.410> out<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.650> its<00:03:15.769> back<00:03:16.120> so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
chunk of it missing out of its back so

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.460 
chunk of it missing out of its back so
let's<00:03:17.299> go<00:03:17.420> ahead<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.690> go<00:03:17.810> on<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.170> main

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
let's go ahead and go on to the main

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.410 
let's go ahead and go on to the main
build<00:03:18.859> of<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.190> set<00:03:19.400> which<00:03:19.579> is<00:03:19.760> actually<00:03:20.239> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
build of the set which is actually the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.530 
build of the set which is actually the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
getaway glider so here's the glider very

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.449 
getaway glider so here's the glider very
simple<00:03:27.019> build<00:03:27.200> very<00:03:27.620> cool<00:03:27.920> though<00:03:28.160> it's

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
simple build very cool though it's

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.560 
simple build very cool though it's
pretty<00:03:29.090> much<00:03:29.299> made<00:03:29.690> out<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.970> pieces<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.239> a

the sheriff guy and the deputy ons place

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.660 
the sheriff guy and the deputy ons place
the<00:03:47.420> play<00:03:47.599> feature<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:52.370> much<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.610> a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
the play feature is this not much of a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.850 
the play feature is this not much of a
Play<00:03:52.819> feature<00:03:52.849> but<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.390> kind<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.659> is<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:54.680> one

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
Play feature but it kind of is like one

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.839 
Play feature but it kind of is like one
of<00:03:54.950> those<00:03:55.540> directional<00:03:56.540> wind<00:03:56.810> blowing

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
of those directional wind blowing

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.280 
of those directional wind blowing
chicken-coop<00:03:58.909> type<00:03:59.480> deals<00:03:59.750> where<00:04:00.049> it's<00:04:00.170> up

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
chicken-coop type deals where it's up

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.199 
chicken-coop type deals where it's up
top<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.680> barn<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.700> blows<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
top of the barn it blows in the

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.640 
top of the barn it blows in the
direction<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.870> wind<00:04:03.049> might<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.349> going

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
direction that the wind might be going

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.610 
direction that the wind might be going
so<00:04:03.890> maybe<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.879> helps<00:04:05.120> them<00:04:05.209> fly<00:04:05.420> around

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
so maybe that helps them fly around

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.740 
so maybe that helps them fly around
because<00:04:06.620> he's<00:04:06.769> probably<00:04:06.950> not<00:04:07.220> very<00:04:07.280> good<00:04:07.750> at

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
because he's probably not very good at

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900 
because he's probably not very good at
flying<00:04:09.109> this<00:04:09.440> glider<00:04:09.739> but<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.459> very<00:04:10.670> cool

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
flying this glider but it is a very cool

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.509 
flying this glider but it is a very cool
looking<00:04:11.209> glider<00:04:11.510> has<00:04:12.109> an<00:04:12.500> area<00:04:12.890> for<00:04:13.099> him<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
looking glider has an area for him to

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.509 
looking glider has an area for him to
seem<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.629> be<00:04:14.780> holding<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:16.250> basically

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
seem to be holding on to it basically

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.599 
seem to be holding on to it basically
just<00:04:16.760> clips<00:04:17.690> on<00:04:17.959> by<00:04:18.260> his<00:04:18.530> piece<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
just clips on by his piece of the

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.689 
just clips on by his piece of the
resistance<00:04:20.239> prick<00:04:20.600> in<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.380> back<00:04:21.699> you

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
resistance prick in the back you

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.570 
resistance prick in the back you
basically<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.120> take<00:04:23.330> this<00:04:23.570> break<00:04:24.400> place<00:04:25.400> it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
basically just take this break place it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.180 
basically just take this break place it
down<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.389> area<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.110> then<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.830> place

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
down in this area and then you place

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.990 
down in this area and then you place
Emmet<00:04:28.729> into<00:04:29.539> that<00:04:30.010> right<00:04:31.010> there<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.820> that's

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
Emmet into that right there so that's

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.140 
Emmet into that right there so that's
how<00:04:32.150> he<00:04:32.210> stays<00:04:32.539> on<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.370> basically<00:04:34.850> it

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
how he stays on so that's basically it

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.080 
how he stays on so that's basically it
for<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:36.340> piece<00:04:37.340> you're<00:04:37.610> just<00:04:37.760> gonna<00:04:37.910> be

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
for this piece you're just gonna be

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.540 
for this piece you're just gonna be
flying<00:04:38.360> around<00:04:38.570> getting<00:04:39.110> away<00:04:39.470> he<00:04:40.280> probably

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
flying around getting away he probably

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.540 
flying around getting away he probably
built<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.389> in<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.870> hurry<00:04:42.160> trying<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.340> get<00:04:43.460> away

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
built it in a hurry trying to get away

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.779 
built it in a hurry trying to get away
from<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:44.060> sheriff<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:46.160> deputy<00:04:46.669> on<00:04:48.789> so

from the sheriff and the deputy on so

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.450 
from the sheriff and the deputy on so
