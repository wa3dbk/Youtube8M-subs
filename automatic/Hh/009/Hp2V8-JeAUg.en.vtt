00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 it's Christmas soon and well it's time 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.659
 now to choose his fir tree 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.320
 so what are the differences so 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.299
 we can have at Christmas time then 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.090
 the different fir trees are particularly 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.170
 cut trees or trees or clod 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.880
 fake containers actually 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.580
 so what difference is there between a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.430
 cut fir and fir trees then the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.849
 fir tree keeps him all his system 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.920
 root it is grown in the open ground 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.470
 snatched and can be replanted after 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.690
 after christmas the fir cut ben here he has 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.120
 been grown only for Christmas 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.829
 and that's going to stay in house and after 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.420
 is good to throw we'll say then we 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.790
 found three broad categories in the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
 firs cut the nordmann who keeps his 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.120
 needles and who the most sold in 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 our store you also have the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.930
 like nobilis who has a good 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.610
 progression for sale which is the fir 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.469
 who keep his needles well and who has 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.969
 a smell of fir tree and you have the udders 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.320
 there's the classic that's a little 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.329
 little losing momentum because he loses 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.469
 his needles quickly enough to turn these 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.239
 fir trees purchased at the last moment 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.010
 what are the differences not in 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.809
 mode that can be found then 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.930
 different fir in mode are including 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.820
 spruces with three big 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.450
 varieties we find classical spruce 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.140
 to the sons ya omori persimmon the pen 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.729
 serbia who has a side a little bluish 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.399
 very tight needle very pretty very 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.319
 compact and the pouch glauca which is 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.869
 really the blue fir a spruce 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.179
 also but here with this very side 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.459
 very blue and very decorative the fir tree 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.580
 pot and a fir tree that was grown in 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.360
 his potty since his childhood we will say 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.910
 until sale 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 the fir tree in container containers 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.979
 especially it's fir tree that was torn off 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.149
 and remy job and attention land 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.220
 the root system is not always 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.020
 preserved in this in this case there we go 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.970
 to say there are some we can not replant 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.050
 the other normally can replant the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.459
 two but sometimes we have a few 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.899
 disappointments in the fir tree in fake 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.899
 containers it happens 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.799
 replant a Christmas tree once Christmas is 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.020
 completed the ideal is to take it out in 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.420
 a room we will say little heated he 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.740
 garage or others especially if it freezes 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.720
 strongly it helps to make a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.920
 transition and as soon as time allows 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.170
 well you make a good hole 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.060
 planting as for all but planted 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.130
 and there you can replant your 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.959
 conifers basting abundantly he goes 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.650
 have to rehydrate it after a passage 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.650
 in house we will say
