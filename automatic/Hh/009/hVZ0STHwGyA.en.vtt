00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends welcome to the channel paint 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:06.900
 with marta this is a tutorial channel 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.380
 of drawing paint for all 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.380
 levels 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 today we are going to talk about the color circle 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.110
 or color wheel in spain we say 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.860
 chromatic circle and in other countries 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.140
 you say color wheel 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.060
 this is a chromatic circle one 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.950
 representation of the color circle is 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.460
 can do with colors with less 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.300
 colors here we have it made of three 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.920
 different ways this we have six 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.500
 colors that is the simplest of all 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.080
 the most simplified here we have many 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.710
 more colors 24 colors and here one 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.629
 infinitesimal gradation yo in this video 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.400
 I'll do the most basic thing is the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.890
 of six colors are colors 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.440
 main ones and I'll do it according 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.680
 with this that is a chromatic circle 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.570
 made by a person from unesco and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.750
 which is therefore considered valid 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.530
 officially today I'm going to do it to you like this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.150
 regardless of whether I'm 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 agreement or not that I'm not at all 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 but it is officially considered 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 valid and is an updated circle 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 I tell you about the updated circle 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.860
 because some of you told me not to 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 you understand very well the circle 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 chromatic and you wanted for that a video and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.670
 that's because there's a bit of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.380
 confusion because there was first a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 chromatic circle with certain 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.410
 colors was the classic circle of all 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.080
 life and then they changed it then 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.910
 they changed the primary colors and in addition 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.830
 in today's manuals because 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.940
 sometimes some colors the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.570
 they call it a little bit 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.950
 different that's why people are the day 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.580
 For those who do not know, I say very 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 briefly how to do the circle first 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.670
 I look for the center of the paper joining the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 ends so diagonally and in that center 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.980
 I spike to make the circle and leave it 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.470
 focused on paper 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.960
 I have very weak compass and I have not 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.140
 tight the screw so you'll see 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.230
 how it twists me let's see if there 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.230
 luck 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 well upstairs a little bit has been spoiled 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 but it does not matter because that then goes to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.350
 cover now with a ruler I make a line 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.940
 horizontal that passes through the center of the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.300
 I am doing it by eye 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.850
 really and good we already have the circle 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.880
 divided in two and now from the center 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.790
 until that extreme I look for that measure that 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.740
 is the radio while keeping the compass 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.640
 with that skewer opening there in the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:47.700
 extreme and I put the measure up and down 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 and on the other side I do the same 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.069
 and now I have the circle divided or 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.739
 six parts and I'm going to mark them like that with 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.780
 the rule to then fill in color 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.740
 those six parts 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.950
 excuse me the voice because I am 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.460
 we need yellow magenta 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.130
 and cyan 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.960
 we start with yellow normally in 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.450
 chromatic circles do not usually put 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.370
 always up is a conventionalism 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.070
 It is not that it is very important 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.350
 I think I fill in yellow this 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.270
 part you already know that yellow is a 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.450
 primary color is to say is a color that 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.640
 it can not be done now we take magenta 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.920
 it's dry go first I have the compass 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.290
 loose and the magenta I have it dry I'm going to 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.960
 give it as you can leaving a space 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.510
 between average as you see and on that side and 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.660
 now I take the cyan which is a type of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.060
 blue and it occurs in the other space that 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.890
 is leaving also a space 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.580
 intermediate between one and another color here 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.940
 we have the three primary yellow red 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.120
 magenta and cyan blue or magenta yellow and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.180
 cyan there are people who say simply 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.220
 magenta cyan other people say red 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.110
 magenta and blue cyan here you have them 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.420
 three with those intermediate gaps 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.490
 now we are going to mix the colors 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.990
 two by two first the yellow with the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.390
 magenta in equal parts then you see 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.850
 that here we get a pretty orange 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.560
 intense pretty dark and we're going to 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.890
 place in between the two that 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.040
 we have mixed this good is called 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.850
 orange although some authors put in 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.040
 red consider it the least red and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.650
 others to not complicate life says 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.350
 in orange red and so they are not wrong 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.870
 in this circle that I am doing 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.390
 it puts orange it's called orange now 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.750
 we mix the cyan with the yellow 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.140
 equal parts also 50% and we achieve 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.060
 green and we put it between the 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.729
 yellow and cyan which are what we have 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.650
 mixed 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.229
 and finally we make the mixture that we 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.610
 is that they were made with the magenta 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.120
 will mix a little bit badly because the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:09.020
 magenta is dry to see if I get it and 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 what we get is a violet we put it 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.490
 between the two and here you have the 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 chromatic circle finished as not 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.389
 see very well with this light I'm going to 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.949
 photographing better and longer dry see here 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.949
 they see better the colors that have been 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.169
 and let's go over a bit what we have 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.560
 done we have mixed the three primary 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.529
 what are these three are the yellow the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.650
 magenta and cyan are named 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:42.430
 currently as the primary colors 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.560
 of the primary chromatic circle means 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.990
 which are the three main colors of 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.490
 those who do all the others and who 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.720
 you can not do mix you have to 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.870
 buy them ready-made 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.820
 these three others that I point out here are the 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.580
 secondary colors that are the ones that 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.580
 do from the mixture of two 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.780
 primary equal parts and are the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.000
 orange or red orange the violet and 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.760
 the green 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.390
 in the next video about the circle 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:19.300
 chromatic I will use the color wheel with 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.300
 24 colors up to the view
