she<00:02:49.750> had<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.639> lot<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:52.030> she<00:02:52.209> was<00:02:52.329> just

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
she had a just a lot of she was just

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.229 
she had a just a lot of she was just
very<00:02:52.569> outgoing<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.650> she<00:02:53.709> was<00:02:54.010> maybe<00:02:54.970> not<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
very outgoing so she was maybe not the

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.479 
very outgoing so she was maybe not the
most<00:02:55.299> natural<00:02:55.629> at<00:02:55.959> first<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.590> was<00:02:56.799> willing<00:02:57.250> to

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
most natural at first but was willing to

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.369 
most natural at first but was willing to
try<00:02:57.700> anything<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.359> throw<00:02:58.900> herself<00:02:59.170> into

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
try anything and just throw herself into

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.069 
try anything and just throw herself into
it<00:02:59.620> I'd<00:03:00.159> say<00:03:00.430> Kim<00:03:01.150> was<00:03:01.389> so<00:03:01.599> much<00:03:01.750> fun<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.930> work

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
but you know she said to be honest you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.830 
but you know she said to be honest you
know<00:03:06.370> I'm<00:03:06.519> not<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.730> dead<00:03:07.000> throne<00:03:07.299> just<00:03:07.599> try<00:03:07.780> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
know I'm not a dead throne just try to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.119

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.369 
have some fun and she did a really good
job<00:03:09.189> I'd<00:03:09.939> say<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.299> most<00:03:10.480> natural<00:03:10.720> at<00:03:11.200> with

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
job I'd say the most natural at with

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.539 
job I'd say the most natural at with
dance<00:03:11.650> ability<00:03:12.010> would<00:03:12.099> probably<00:03:12.430> have<00:03:12.519> been

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
dance ability would probably have been

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.179 
dance ability would probably have been
Shannon<00:03:13.060> Shannon<00:03:13.780> could<00:03:14.139> naturally<00:03:14.950> move
