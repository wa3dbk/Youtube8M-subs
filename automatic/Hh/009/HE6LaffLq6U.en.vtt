 mixture 2014 in an area of ​​precisely 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 12 hectares which nine and a half 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.740
 have destined for this great fair 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.280
 gastronomic today is being made 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.770
 a work of verification of everything 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.719
 that will show this fair to the public and 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.399
 We are with the resident in society 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.159
 Peruvian astronomy by arnaldo roca 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.260
 king to tell us about the 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.600
 importance of this fair for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.399
 the Peruvians is because it is a showcase 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 also of the gastronomy that is already 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.010
 well placed and for the Peruvians and for 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.800
 foreigners 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.859
 good as they are advancing work 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 they go as you can see them watching 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.829
 all the viewers we are at 80% 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 for this an amazing speed already 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 we also have great experience in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 place is in our second year in that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.820
 site and the seventh year in the history of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 Peruvian cuisine in terms of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.799
 figures let's say how much is expected 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 let's say of sales visitors what 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 go through is will we hope to sell from 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.509
 possibly half a million entries and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.409
 we expect of course an influx of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.990
 public greater than 600 thousand people there 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 to keep in mind that here in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.700
 the fairs work more than seven thousand 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.039
 people every day then more or 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 less that makes the complement of the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.280
 another 50 thousand that we hope to have all 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.049
 the days after a first 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 last year's experience let's say that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.700
 they have improved 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 we have said improvements especially in the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.020
 part of content 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.990
 in the implemente we also have a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.130
 implant and an asphalt layer that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.890
 some way is going to prevent the dust to the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 engineer but that's what they told us and about 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.530
 all in the thematic issue having 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.679
 a kitchen inside the market to be able 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.780
 put in value the fruits that of some 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.480
 way they have to do with the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.239
 biodiversity will allow many 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.930
 Peruvians from many places can 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.540
 recognize what comes from your sites and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.060
 about everything that is exotic to the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.459
 lime the things that always worry and 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 that reason, let's say, of repeated 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.650
 questions is the theme of the area 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.900
 evacuation we have been we have already had 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.480
 some tremors in strong of magnitude 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.380
 6 these days and well was the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 possibility that at any time 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 there may be an earthquake of equal or greater 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 intensity in what way we say is 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.550
 protecting the population that attends him 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.019
 the evacuation plan that has been made 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.710
 by the municipality of Magdalena has 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.340
 been 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.069
 for the city of Lima so 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.760
 of modern 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.139
 of specific is the plan that of some 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.920
 way would allow us an evacuation 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.659
 fast now you do not have to think no 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 go to the beach all summer through 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.549
 fear of a tsunami not one that occurred in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.030
 the last 200 years I hope not 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.170
 they do not happen in the next 20 days either 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.930
 but while God blesses us with 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.900
 this peace this technique at least is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.489
 let's hope it is not more than more 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.709
 that there have been but in any case there are two 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.459
 evacuation routes is well signposted 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.109
 we have done a tour of 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.419
 the same routes is a plan of 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.969
 highly effective evacuation and I'm 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.560
 sure that the sun will also come out 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.880
 patricia some question a concern 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.490
 for mister fernando roca rey 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.670
 and how the order of the 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.070
 entries how the topic is being anticipated 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.970
 of the parking lot that last year 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.460
 It also generated great discomfort 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.130
 if precisely the theme of the tickets 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.150
 how tickets are organized 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.250
 and also on the subject of parking 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
 to avoid let's say the room the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.330
 agglomerations the objections to see one 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.010
 for one in the entrances in teleticket 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.180
 as every year in them 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.410
 Places to share with time 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 especially if you happen to be used 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 Sunday do it already as for 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.190
 it turns out there are 12 parking lots 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.350
 hectares of fairs two of them are 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.870
 dedicated to parking but my 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.750
 recommendation if I can do some is 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.940
 do not come in your own car come 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.850
 in public service especially in the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.580
 metropolitan or they will try very little not 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.520
 make them be stuck to a doing that walk 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.680
 a few blocks to find your car and 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.070
 above all you can go if binner at the time 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.070
 what do they want
