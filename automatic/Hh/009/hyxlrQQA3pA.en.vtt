fred is the nice natural starting place

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.420 
fred is the nice natural starting place
that<00:00:55.510> we<00:00:55.600> want<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:56.020> assume<00:00:56.380> when<00:00:57.010> we<00:00:57.160> approach

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
that we want to assume when we approach

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.350 
that we want to assume when we approach
the<00:00:57.610> piano<00:00:57.910> right<00:00:58.120> so<00:00:59.579> let's<00:01:00.579> do<00:01:00.790> Fred<00:01:01.150> here

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
the piano right so let's do Fred here

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.109 
the piano right so let's do Fred here
take<00:01:02.110> Fred<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.920> let's<00:01:03.130> do<00:01:03.280> three<00:01:03.520> experiments

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
take Fred and let's do three experiments

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:13.760 
take Fred and let's do three experiments
shall<00:01:04.449> we<00:01:05.520> first<00:01:06.520> thing<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:08.250> let's<00:01:09.250> relax

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.319 

relax<00:01:14.770> what<00:01:15.009> is<00:01:15.039> relaxation<00:01:15.369> right<00:01:15.969> well<00:01:16.179> then

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
relax what is relaxation right well then

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.489 
relax what is relaxation right well then
this<00:01:16.420> before<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:16.990> art<00:01:17.139> of<00:01:17.200> doing

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
this before it's the art of doing

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.919 
this before it's the art of doing
nothing<00:01:17.649> well<00:01:18.100> doing<00:01:19.090> nothing<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.569> I'm<00:01:19.749> just

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
nothing well doing nothing is I'm just

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.169 
nothing well doing nothing is I'm just
going<00:01:20.079> to<00:01:20.109> collapse<00:01:20.789> clearly<00:01:21.789> not<00:01:21.939> something

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
going to collapse clearly not something

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.870 
going to collapse clearly not something
we<00:01:22.479> want<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.780> cultivate<00:01:22.960> at<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.439> piano<00:01:23.880> it's

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
we want to cultivate at the piano it's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.099 
we want to cultivate at the piano it's
due<00:01:25.179> experiment<00:01:25.929> number<00:01:25.990> two<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.539> from<00:01:28.719> Fred

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
not naturally capable of number two any

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.580 
not naturally capable of number two any
and<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.370> mean<00:02:55.610> any<00:02:55.840> tension<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.350> you

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and I mean any tension that you

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
and I mean any tension that you
experience<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.519> an<00:02:58.790> invitation<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> gently

way<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.850> eliminate<00:03:08.180> tension<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.110> by

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
way to eliminate tension is by

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
way to eliminate tension is by
understanding<00:03:09.320> how<00:03:10.010> your<00:03:10.280> body<00:03:10.670> works<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.420> by

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
understanding how your body works and by

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.319 
understanding how your body works and by
yielding<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.560> its<00:03:12.709> natural<00:03:13.090> tendencies<00:03:14.090> not

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
yielding to its natural tendencies not

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:21.310 
yielding to its natural tendencies not
by<00:03:14.989> fighting<00:03:15.470> them<00:03:18.280> number<00:03:19.280> four<00:03:20.140> another<00:03:21.140> way

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
by fighting them number four another way

by fighting them number four another way
to<00:03:21.350> eliminate<00:03:21.620> tension<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:23.000> by<00:03:23.239> making<00:03:23.450> sure

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
to eliminate tension is by making sure

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.870 
to eliminate tension is by making sure
that<00:03:24.019> all<00:03:24.230> your<00:03:24.380> body<00:03:24.739> parts<00:03:24.920> work<00:03:25.549> together
