00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Zuma simplifies the answer and write it down 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.599
 as a mixed number here we have two 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 mixed numbers have a whole part and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.969
 the other part is a fraction one way 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.640
 of adding these two mixed numbers is 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.000
 pass them to improper fractions add 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.859
 the fractions and then the result 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.449
 pass it back mixed number that roll 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.869
 no but you can also tell see to see 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:36.010
 17 whole two ninths is the same as 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.370
 17 integers plus two ninths 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.899
 on the other hand five whole a ninth 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.170
 it's the same as five whole plus one 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.510
 ninth and we want to add these two 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.780
 propositions are totally 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.299
 equivalents now we have a lot of 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.729
 numbers that we are adding and we know 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:01.269
 that when we add the order we do not 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:06.310
 it matters then we can 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.570
 write as 17 more 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.360
 5 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.360
 plus two ninths 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.479
 plus 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.670
 1 - basically what I did was first 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.900
 put the whole numbers and then put 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 the fractions 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.850
 this part of here is 17 - five that 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 we know it is 22 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.200
 and this part of here 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.340
 are two fractions that we have to add 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 two ninths plus a ninth as they have the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.030
 same denominator the fraction will be between 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.740
 9 and now we only have to add the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.829
 numerators two plus one that is 3 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.079
 and we get three ninths but observe 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.240
 that we can simplify this because 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.229
 both the numerator and the denominator 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.950
 we can divide them by 3 then 3 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.800
 between 3 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.350
 the 1 and 9 between 33 and we finished the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 sum 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.760
 because 22 plus one third is the same as 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.760
 22 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.540
 one third
