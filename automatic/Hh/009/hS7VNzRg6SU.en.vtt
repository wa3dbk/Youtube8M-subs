00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.740
 to study an ignition system on 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 a car here mines models 2003 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 sonata we read our wiring diagram 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.330
 here on the board we will study the system 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.599
 ignition I think the system there 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 is particular here we have some reels 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.749
 bobigny ignition coil ignition 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.499
 which thus feeds the cylinder a 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:30.179
 gap and then 2-3 here and we can 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.420
 notice that the diet of our two 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.129
 single-wire reels with three wires 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 one more that happen here we have a bet 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.649
 the mass that comes here this module that put 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 by hand lands here and has a collar 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.570
 waves of our transistors and when the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 transistor becomes to be passing it 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.289
 must he receives a pulse from our from 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 our calculator here to order my 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 transistor 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 when my transistor is going to be not without 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 my reel at the price level but we will 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.049
 to load this convoy stopped feeding 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 our transistors at its base 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.329
 So my reel will not be fed 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.119
 water raincourt in deduction is so there 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.130
 the spark at that moment we can do 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.770
 a test of the oscilloscope against 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.079
 will see paul induced voltage 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.079
 our hanau system says we can 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.210
 to do here is to go and measure the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.659
 command our triggering the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.479
 transistor and we can go and measure here 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 the intensity consumed by our coil 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.079
 that's what we'll be able to do and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 like on our bubble we have a son of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.180
 candle we can also take the high 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.219
 tension because the scope we set 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.219
 the voltage on the power wire here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.980
 when consuming our coil 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 we notice that we have coils that is 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.050
 directly lodge on the first candle 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.840
 and his reel comes out here to go 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.470
 feed silo number four and we have 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 same thing we have two coils for 2.6 to 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
 a reel for two weeks 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.860
 it's connected here our blue way the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.050
 first sees on the diet of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.450
 coils we got here on the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.100
 trigger the red wire a pass in 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.790
 lose metrics here on our 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.450
 increase dominate we 'll see you go 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.960
 not that we are simply owed for 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.960
 make a recording 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.880
 I will make a stop on images 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.909
 m 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.540
 story is interesting here we see 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.700
 the stalemate loses metrics on the way 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.489
 green an increase here from our 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:19.319
 current when ordered in 1 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:20.459
 up to 8.8 loses five here which 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.290
 control my transistor 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.450
 when my transistor here when we 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.400
 happens to the tension we see pretty much 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.940
 a voltage of 3 volts 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.880
 yes other volte will find a little less 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.200
 4 volts reads passersby when he is 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.330
 ordered we see when it is 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.250
 also ordered in the currents 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.769
 increase in our coils when 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.049
 is no longer power my transistor the 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.430
 current at nono of coils 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.280
 instantly and we can see on our 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:55.110
 supply here the voltage drop of the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.549
 made a presentation by cons I do not 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:02.160
 can not see a cynic that's 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.480
 particular about this system here here a good 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.130
 control of our ignition system 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.840
 when one is ordered against the 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.500
 transistor power is housed at 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 the inside of the box
