situations are usually places where

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.890 
situations are usually places where
there's<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.670> lot<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> noise<00:00:21.270> whether<00:00:21.660> that's

is<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.370> room<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.600> reverberant<00:00:37.230> like

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is a room that's really reverberant like

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
is a room that's really reverberant like
a<00:00:37.470> gymnasium<00:00:37.949> but<00:00:38.370> even<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:38.970> of<00:00:39.090> times<00:00:39.300> your

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a gymnasium but even a lot of times your

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.759 
a gymnasium but even a lot of times your
living<00:00:39.900> room<00:00:40.080> that<00:00:40.229> doesn't<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> lot<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
living room that doesn't have a lot of

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.130 
living room that doesn't have a lot of
furniture<00:00:41.010> carpets<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.720> sound<00:00:42.900> can

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
furniture carpets can the sound can

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.590 
furniture carpets can the sound can
bounce<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.890> lot<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.879> gets<00:00:45.089> tough<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
bounce around a lot and it gets tough to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.460 
bounce around a lot and it gets tough to
deliver<00:00:45.780> clear<00:00:46.500> quality<00:00:47.750> audio<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:49.229> people

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
deliver clear quality audio where people

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.600 
deliver clear quality audio where people
can<00:00:49.620> understand<00:00:50.040> everything<00:00:50.309> you're<00:00:50.489> saying

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
can understand everything you're saying

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
can understand everything you're saying
so<00:00:51.089> obviously<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.720> you're<00:00:51.809> putting<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.229> up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so obviously if you're putting this up

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
so obviously if you're putting this up
and<00:00:52.650> doing<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> podcast<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and doing the podcast you think it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
and doing the podcast you think it's
worth<00:00:54.210> hearing<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.320> there's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.589> couple

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
worth hearing so there's a couple

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.399 
worth hearing so there's a couple
different<00:00:56.010> solutions<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.330> do<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
different solutions that you can do that

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.009 
different solutions that you can do that
don't<00:00:58.650> cost<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> whole<00:00:59.220> lot<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.519> money<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.900> get

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
don't cost a whole lot of money to get

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.170 
don't cost a whole lot of money to get
better<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.739> clear<00:01:02.010> sound<00:01:02.339> quality<00:01:02.790> I'm

but<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.640> again<00:02:03.630> pretty<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.409> price

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
but this one again pretty good price

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.580 
but this one again pretty good price
point<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> couple<00:02:05.880> problems

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
point but it's got a couple problems

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.430 
point but it's got a couple problems
that<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.950> too<00:02:08.190> crazy<00:02:08.460> about<00:02:09.289> one<00:02:10.289> thing

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that I'm not too crazy about one thing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.480 
that I'm not too crazy about one thing
that<00:02:10.590> you're<00:02:10.710> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.130> deal<00:02:11.310> with

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
that you're going to have to deal with

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.910 
that you're going to have to deal with
is<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> fact<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.200> mono<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.860> if

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
is the fact that it's just mono and if

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
is the fact that it's just mono and if
you<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.190> plug<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> straight<00:02:14.700> into<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.450> small

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you just plug it straight into the small

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.930 
you just plug it straight into the small
mini<00:02:16.049> input<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> your<00:02:16.739> camera<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.610> only

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
mini input of your camera it's only

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.970 
mini input of your camera it's only
going<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.120> record<00:02:18.420> onto<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.900> side<00:02:19.170> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
going to record onto one side that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.080 
going to record onto one side that
didn't<00:02:20.190> bother<00:02:20.310> me<00:02:20.550> too<00:02:20.670> much<00:02:20.700> there's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
didn't bother me too much there's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.059 
didn't bother me too much there's
adapters<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.870> can<00:02:22.019> do<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.170> convert<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
adapters that you can do to convert that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.970 
adapters that you can do to convert that
one<00:02:23.370> thing<00:02:24.049> from<00:02:25.049> radio<00:02:25.349> shack<00:02:25.409> where<00:02:25.830> it'll

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
one thing from radio shack where it'll

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.830 
one thing from radio shack where it'll
just<00:02:26.220> go<00:02:26.370> straight<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.299> record<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> both

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
just go straight in and record to both

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.930 
just go straight in and record to both
sides<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.980> lot<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.190> interviews<00:02:29.489> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
sides I do a lot of interviews and

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.630 
sides I do a lot of interviews and
things<00:02:30.000> like<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:32.159> just<00:02:32.430> got

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
things like that so I actually just got

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.420 
things like that so I actually just got
this<00:02:32.819> small<00:02:33.269> adapter<00:02:33.900> from<00:02:34.019> radioshack<00:02:34.680> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
this small adapter from radioshack that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.390 
this small adapter from radioshack that
actually<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.209> stereo<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.739> mono<00:02:38.160> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
actually is stereo here and mono and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
actually is stereo here and mono and
mono<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.819> there<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.510> actually<00:02:39.720> run<00:02:40.019> two

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
mono in there so I can actually run two

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470 
mono in there so I can actually run two
of<00:02:40.319> these<00:02:40.500> mics<00:02:40.799> together<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.849> put<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.330> me

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
of these mics together to put one on me

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.440 
of these mics together to put one on me
and<00:02:42.720> one<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.080> person<00:02:43.379> I'm<00:02:43.470> interviewing

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and one on the person I'm interviewing

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.089 
and one on the person I'm interviewing
so<00:02:45.450> pretty<00:02:46.319> cool<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:46.739> there's<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.010> couple

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
so pretty cool but there's a couple

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.789 
so pretty cool but there's a couple
problems<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.849> don't<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.799> these

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
problems that I don't like about these

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.300 
problems that I don't like about these
mics<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.269> main<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.410> has<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.680> 20

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
mics and the main one is it has a 20

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.089 
mics and the main one is it has a 20
foot<00:02:53.579> cable<00:02:54.299> attached<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.980> pretty

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
foot cable attached to it that's pretty

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.190 
foot cable attached to it that's pretty
cool<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.670> terms<00:02:56.879> of<00:02:57.030> some<00:02:57.420> flexibility<00:02:58.079> but

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
cool in terms of some flexibility but

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.380 
cool in terms of some flexibility but
there's<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.440> couple<00:02:58.620> problems<00:02:59.060> the<00:03:00.060> first

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
there's a couple problems the first

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.210 
there's a couple problems the first
being<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> long<00:03:02.060> unbalanced<00:03:03.060> cable<00:03:04.220> it's

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
being it is a long unbalanced cable it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.009 
being it is a long unbalanced cable it's
beyond<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.700> scope<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.970> what<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.690> do<00:03:06.840> today

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
beyond the scope of what I can do today

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.050 
beyond the scope of what I can do today
to<00:03:07.140> get<00:03:07.349> into<00:03:07.650> what<00:03:07.890> balanced<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.549> unbalanced

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to get into what balanced and unbalanced

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.259 
to get into what balanced and unbalanced
means<00:03:09.299> but<00:03:09.930> basically<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.910> unbalanced<00:03:11.910> cable

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
means but basically a unbalanced cable

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.289 
means but basically a unbalanced cable
isn't<00:03:12.480> very<00:03:12.900> good<00:03:13.140> at<00:03:13.410> rejecting<00:03:13.799> noise<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.000> if

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
isn't very good at rejecting noise so if

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.119 
isn't very good at rejecting noise so if
there's<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.599> lot<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> radio<00:03:16.170> interference<00:03:16.799> or

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
there's a lot of radio interference or

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.360 
there's a lot of radio interference or
electrical<00:03:17.730> buzz<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.650> surrounding<00:03:20.220> area

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
electrical buzz in the surrounding area

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.849 
electrical buzz in the surrounding area
which<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.030> almost<00:03:21.420> anywhere<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.230> big<00:03:22.530> city

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
which is almost anywhere in big city

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.879 
which is almost anywhere in big city
these<00:03:23.640> little<00:03:24.000> unbalanced<00:03:24.930> lines<00:03:25.260> can

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
these little unbalanced lines can

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.920 
these little unbalanced lines can
actually<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.310> very<00:03:26.579> susceptible<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.419> noise<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
actually be very susceptible to noise so

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.569 
actually be very susceptible to noise so
that<00:03:28.079> can<00:03:28.230> actually<00:03:28.530> create<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.829> problem<00:03:29.370> so

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
that can actually create a problem so

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
that can actually create a problem so
you've<00:03:30.030> got<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.359> more<00:03:30.599> clear<00:03:30.930> version<00:03:31.230> of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
you've got this more clear version of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.809 
you've got this more clear version of
your<00:03:31.590> voice<00:03:31.769> being<00:03:32.040> recorded<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.669> you've

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
your voice being recorded but you've

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.370 
your voice being recorded but you've
also<00:03:32.970> got<00:03:33.180> electrical<00:03:33.660> buzz<00:03:33.870> or<00:03:34.109> radio

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
also got electrical buzz or radio

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.890 
also got electrical buzz or radio
interference<00:03:34.799> which<00:03:35.519> isn't<00:03:35.940> ideal<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
interference which isn't ideal so it's a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.420 
interference which isn't ideal so it's a
good<00:03:37.019> thing<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.380> check<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:38.010> headphones

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
good thing to check with headphones

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.009

prestigious interview I came up with a
very<00:04:24.360> high-tech<00:04:24.720> solution<00:04:25.620> how<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.130> deal<00:04:26.430> with

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
very high-tech solution how to deal with

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.520 
very high-tech solution how to deal with
this<00:04:26.639> in<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.849> future<00:04:29.630> recycled<00:04:30.630> toilet<00:04:31.050> paper

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
this in the future recycled toilet paper

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.950 
this in the future recycled toilet paper
rolls<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.700> it's<00:04:33.000> basically<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.539> card

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
rolls so it's basically the card

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.100 
rolls so it's basically the card
bored<00:04:34.110> role<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.830> comes<00:04:35.130> with<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.930> toilet

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
bored role that comes with the toilet

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.909 
bored role that comes with the toilet
paper<00:04:37.440> what<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.250> did<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.580> we<00:04:38.789> just<00:04:39.090> went<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
paper what we did is we just went and

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.730 
paper what we did is we just went and
cut<00:04:40.919> one<00:04:41.220> little<00:04:41.870> cut<00:04:42.870> here<00:04:42.900> on<00:04:43.259> one<00:04:43.410> end<00:04:43.590> and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
cut one little cut here on one end and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.529 
cut one little cut here on one end and
then<00:04:44.099> here<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.460> opposite<00:04:44.789> side<00:04:45.030> just<00:04:45.360> cut

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
then here on the opposite side just cut

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.890 
then here on the opposite side just cut
one<00:04:45.780> little<00:04:46.349> bit<00:04:46.500> here<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:48.479> that<00:04:48.630> makes<00:04:48.780> for

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
one little bit here and that makes for

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.749 
one little bit here and that makes for
actually<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.289> pretty<00:04:49.620> darn<00:04:49.919> cool<00:04:50.310> storage

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
actually a pretty darn cool storage

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.059 
actually a pretty darn cool storage
solution<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.930> we<00:04:52.020> take<00:04:52.169> this<00:04:52.349> little<00:04:52.560> lav<00:04:52.800> mic

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
solution so we take this little lav mic

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.920 
solution so we take this little lav mic
put<00:04:53.880> one<00:04:54.090> end<00:04:54.240> here<00:04:55.669> slide<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.819> through<00:04:57.090> if<00:04:57.780> you

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
put one end here slide it through if you

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.140 
put one end here slide it through if you
can<00:04:58.080> see<00:04:58.259> that<00:04:58.289> and<00:04:58.699> then<00:04:59.699> just<00:04:59.880> start

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
can see that and then just start

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.100 
can see that and then just start
wrapping<00:05:01.819> so<00:05:02.819> wrapping<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.569> wrapping<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
wrapping so wrapping and wrapping and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.960 
wrapping so wrapping and wrapping and
wrapping<00:05:04.139> told<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.310> cable<00:05:05.669> was<00:05:05.789> long

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
wrapping told you this cable was long

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.659
