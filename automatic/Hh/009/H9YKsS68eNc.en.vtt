00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
think I hmm yeah I think none of those

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:50.580 
think I hmm yeah I think none of those
are<00:03:40.180> sweating<00:03:40.659> and<00:03:45.810> loss<00:03:47.129> batch<00:03:48.930> not<00:03:49.930> known<00:03:50.349> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
are sweating and loss batch not known is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:00.440 
are sweating and loss batch not known is
fighting<00:03:51.040> either<00:03:51.159> so<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:56.340> guess<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.939> whenever

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.640 

like<00:04:01.450> if<00:04:01.629> one<00:04:01.989> hatches<00:04:02.799> from<00:04:03.659> each<00:04:04.659> little

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
like if one hatches from each little

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.460 
like if one hatches from each little
container<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.639> six<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.060> each<00:04:07.150> container<00:04:07.470> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
container so six in each container and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.399 
container so six in each container and
60<00:04:09.159> s<00:04:09.190> 4<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.670> 24<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:12.220> if<00:04:12.909> one<00:04:13.659> hatch<00:04:13.930> from<00:04:14.139> there

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
60 s 4 is 24 so if one hatch from there

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.259 
60 s 4 is 24 so if one hatch from there
