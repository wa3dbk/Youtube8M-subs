00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.420
 hello together and welcome back to 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.580
 12 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.710
 next to the first part and in the standalone 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.150
 addon the cattle chronicles is that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.010
 meanwhile our third and so far 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.040
 Biggest trip in our crazy fantasy 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.599
 world we wanted to be a classic again 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.670
 really great point and click game 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.410
 full of mysterious madness objects 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.660
 and make even crazier characters 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.690
 and that is the reason why you always 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.090
 should have a reliable partner 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.250
 a small thing 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.430
 I 've got it I want to talk to you now 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.449
 but get out of here 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.640
 but we still wanted a step 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.620
 go on and thanks to you we could 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.540
 with the help of your support 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.460
 on kickstarter and the steam early 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.180
 Access we were able to do that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.030
 we have in mind 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.310
 a humorous adventure with hundreds 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.070
 puzzle orchestra soundtrack and one 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.260
 epic story and with 25 hours 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.210
 Playtime is the buga of contains two 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.930
 one of the biggest adventures of the last 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 ten years 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.619
 It's like my father always said 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.140
 politically long bird the left 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 exclamation mark 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.710
 what yes he was very eloquent 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.049
 We could call a technique 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 use protection mapping which the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.200
 locations appear three-dimensional 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.640
 leaves without us on details 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.960
 dispense or the system requirement 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 had to raise 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.610
