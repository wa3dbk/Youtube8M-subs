00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello I am today with 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.820
 stéphane blanchet chef and founder 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 gourmet initiation 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.900
 so to decorate a delicious 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.849
 caramel cream stéphane showed me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
 how to make your own carmel 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.529
 to get a caramel to make a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.820
 cream caramel or crenellations that we have 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 need only two things a saucepan 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.260
 and sugar especially no water so in 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.470
 at first I put my pans at 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.710
 heat up and then I'm going to add the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.710
 sugar 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.969
 it's gone and I pour sugar here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.940
 simply no water at all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.379
 especially we do not put any utensils in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
 the pan during cooking 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.640
 it is very important so there the circumference 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 we let him warm up well we go 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 start to see the sugar that will melt 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.649
 around the pan and with one with 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 the hand we're going we'll just move 100 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.910
 m utensils in to mix well 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.409
 this golden caramel a thing that is very 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.659
 important when you make this caramel 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.130
 you stay in front of the pan you do not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.110
 do not do anything else because once 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.760
 that the caramel starts to take it's 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 very fast and in two minutes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 if we do not pay attention we have a caramel 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 who burned here is where we continue to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 stir a little bit you see what he 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 must it happen to see all this sugar 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.189
 white they are they become 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.189
 fondue that become liquid 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.580
 here is a little bit of patience and 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.770
 once he will have a beautiful color 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 which will be well melted we will put it on 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.360
 pour into our little ramekins and we 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.850
 will be ready to declaim caramel 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.680
 look at it and take a look 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.830
 I'll be able to read the verse 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.050
 gently in ramekins or after I 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.950
 would sink my creams to the top 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.990
 you have to wait for the caramel 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 cool before pouring the cream 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.119
 to us is to put them in the oven well 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 sure for good ap but small ramekin on 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.479
 will turn the caramel pay attention 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.350
 because the burn with caramel 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.780
 it's terrible a formidable 180 ° C for 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.720
 the skin is here see it starts to freeze 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.530
 it's perfect and here we'll say 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.600
 let cool 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580
 we have our little ramekins that are 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.280
 ready to welcome the real cream 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.140
 caramel like at grandmother's then the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.700
 little tricky thing to clean the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.470
 saucepan once kara but the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.670
 two in the you have a caramel that 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.190
 is hard at the bottom of the pan 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.810
 it is simply necessary to put 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.730
 the water in the pan you put it back 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.980
 on fire once the water goes 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.250
 put to boil the sugar will melt and 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.410
 the pan will be clean 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.570
 you see the bottom of the pan and 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.130
 all clean the pan and teachers go 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.180
 clean it up a little bit with 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.180
 dishwashing liquid it would be better
