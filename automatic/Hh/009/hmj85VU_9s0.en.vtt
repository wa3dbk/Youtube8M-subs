00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.109
 childbirth tutorial as I'm going to 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:13.870
 explain how to pass a file 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:17.350
 application program or apply from your 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.860
 phone from your pc 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.860
 to 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.210
 Android phone for example sometimes 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.039
 we want to spend a 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.820
 a freckle from our phone 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:38.070
 downloaded from any page 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.220
 from an unknown dotcom upton that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.480
 offers us an infinity of applied and 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.970
 of applications that live 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.809
 what can we do from our 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.700
 phone and since our computer 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.900
 up to our android 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.330
 and how do we do that because first what 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.420
 they do is connect the phone with 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.010
 via USB cable to the computer and the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.830
 computer returning in a window 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 where it says open folder then you 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 open folder and piles them 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.470
 and they 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.180
 then his memory will appear true and therefore 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.380
 when the memory appears 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.399
 from your phone 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 copenhague the pica but now as they do 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:36.540
 to see it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.190
 when disconnecting the phone from the computer 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.390
 where are we going to see it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.390
 you can not see 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.229
 well 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.229
 fine downloads well adjustments and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 Well, a simple way 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 is 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.220
 we fill in the section of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 android sorry marketplace store 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.319
 and here 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.780
 we look for the android zip file manager 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.780
 the tab here our choose 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.780
 jandro 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.460
 yes 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.460
 and they appear yes 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.740
 they choose to click install 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.740
 accept ideas for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.620
 let's see how long it takes 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.600
 to 56 63 80 91 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.370
 99 100 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.370
 and could be ringing 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.750
 April is not necessarily root 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.960
 advance payments 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.840
 and then we look for these our 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.360
 folders everything we have installed 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.420
 our phone and as good now yes 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.440
 we can see our apk that we had 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.440
 passed before 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.680
 and for example had passed the car and 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.680
 Africa 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 I give click on install 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.990
 and now I can install my apk 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.990
 I give click on install 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.459
 installed application 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.190
 man 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.409
 and you can look for book repositories 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.160
 and we will leave then nothing we give happens to 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.260
 see them 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.580
 and then here how I have the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.860
 configuration but that's another subject 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.040
 but I hope that it helps them is 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.840
 this video tutorial and nothing if you like 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 the video subscribe are shared and 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.990
 and that we see in another video tutorial 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.750
 with more explanations about this 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.750
 Android phone until next time
