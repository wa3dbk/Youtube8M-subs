 Today we are in Graz at Magna Steyr 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.280
 where mercedes benz since the tenth grade 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.309

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.180
 twelve-cylinder biturbo engine still that 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.630

 the g class with six wheels 1800 liters 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.430

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.360

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.980
 me now your terrain me 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.080
 to find their way around because there is something else 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.080
 other than in normal terrain were 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.659
 just here straight to the hill up 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.149
 the judge wants beautiful evenly 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.390
 slow in france music on gas 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.390
 stay 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.170
 yes always nice steering every two hands 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.060
 Male always very good 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.440
 stay right right remains open 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:16.709
 right ahead okay you have you say 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 already slow down right through 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.270
 and circumference right away 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.860
 we go up here we were 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.860
 then left away 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.440
 we only see sky 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.370
 Otherwise you want to lock second gear and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.269
 second gear left side of the battle here 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.129
 2 1 and 6 2 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:45.370
 high is always company are 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:48.709
 very much everything remains even with gas 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.069
 Even gas does not stay too much 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.790
 slowly slowly just below it 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.650
 right stick to the right and away 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.760
 drive slowly down to her 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.290
 Brake people eat and right away 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:11.480
 right away forward not too late 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.750
 668 apple earlier a strike is alright 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.220
 very well 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.209
 that is really the request with the horse too 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.650
 drive 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.389
 and drove something in the tunnel 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.210
 completely different or yes through a bit 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.800
 more power since it is often very good 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.800
 losses to drive in any case 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.580
 we drive straight out of the spot 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.870
 tick down 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.909
 I think it was good of her 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.139
 suv so long on a quite 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.139
 quickly over it 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.840
 speed brings security 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.630
 madness 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:14.480
 I just can not just go through it 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:14.480
 Daring loaded by now already 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.840
 only stay in when just in the water 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.840
 turn the wheels off again 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.280
 we create madness 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.470
 So now only up to the water and 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.520
 slow down until the wave is up 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:02.370
 does not it comes before it was 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.530
 until she comes back and on the bike and 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.530
 left continue straight ahead 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.780
 the further down to work around 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.070
 instead, tempo 30 sent us driving 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.100
 already twice that 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:46.070
 we have six cameras here the sinus 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.070
 for that matter and give gas 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:56.090
 who would have great super easy class 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.210
 i did not think so this monster 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.010
 how to drive properly and with the 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.380
 power six wheels never driven 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.760
 and it will impress the feeling 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.390
 thank you mentioned the bible 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.720
 Thank you so that was our day at 63 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.670
 66 of amg a really cool part 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.590
 I am now comfortable on the 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.940
 LadeflÃ¤che because you get more than 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.940
 Adjusted replacement has
