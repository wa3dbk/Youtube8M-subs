00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
skate with a small population so I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520

don't think she will run again I have to
say<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.509> she's<00:02:09.780> running<00:02:10.050> for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.560 
say I think that she's running for
president<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> facebook<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.240> too<00:02:12.360> close

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
president of facebook which is too close

president of facebook which is too close
to<00:02:12.600> nothing<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.880> she'll<00:02:15.150> probably

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
to nothing and I think she'll probably

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080 
to nothing and I think she'll probably
win<00:02:15.630> uh<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.740> can't<00:02:17.310> think<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:17.640> anyone<00:02:17.970> who

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
win uh but I can't think that anyone who

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.430 
win uh but I can't think that anyone who
