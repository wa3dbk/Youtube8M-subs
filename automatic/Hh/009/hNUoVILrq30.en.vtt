 every fall organizes 43 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.719
 mechanized brigade in close 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.380
 cooperation with civil authorities 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.440
 exercise 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.879
 alert while practicing alert together 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.879
 disaster and crisis management 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.150
 hey 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 defense has been one for a number of years 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 structural safety partner of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.890
 civil authorities such as 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.229
 security regions municipality police 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.259
 fire department and the medical doctor 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.909
 aid organization in the region 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.979
 if there is a crisis now then there is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.149
 the fancy well prepared to aid on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.790
 provide assistance to civilian 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.280
 authorities have the military 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.050
 about specialist capacities that the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.229
 subtle partners hardly or not there 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.149
 or that can no longer be used 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 these capacities are regular 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.360
 actually deployed or not in your 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.220
 region 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 The condition here is that it is civilian 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.880
 resources are exhausted or that the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 subtle authorities do not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.320
 about the required capacity 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.230
 to be well prepared for a disaster 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.380
 or crisis is already paramount 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.540
 to practice together during the exercise 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.760
 be alert both civilian and military 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.610
 practice doing intertwined 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.230
 in the most realistic way possible 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.000
 this is good for cooperation 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.210
 and in this way we can optimize each other 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 to learn 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 defense guarantees capabilities for 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.100
 domestic in is under operating 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.690
 directing civilian authority 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.940
 they could also fall during alert 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 authorities quickly dispose of the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.820
 required specialist military 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.820

 a crucial role 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.129
 the again takes care of it 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.830

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.880
 The RMC is the higher level of the too

 civilian and military authorities 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.710
 exercise alert gives him the option 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.490
 to optimally collaborate 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.230
 benefits 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.000

 and where we already have each other perfectly 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.770
 found it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.740
 this intensification of civil-military 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.900

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.780
 security and crisis management 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.730
 The Netherlands 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.390
 finally we are ready for the
