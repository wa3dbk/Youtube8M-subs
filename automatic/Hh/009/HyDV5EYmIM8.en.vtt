 I usually say two things in my usual camp 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:00.190
 This would be that if for some reason say which way or out with wonder if there is no unnecessary chasing two 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.930

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.710
 Immediately I try to open something a little but is the US judge that I was special 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.710
 Yes I 51 Wa over 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.730
 Wow 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 That really 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.360
 real 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.390
 Exactly 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.390
 It looks like 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.290
 And Karuku' in Oh yes game 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.060
 Rain and structure is the same cloudy Hatta 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.450
 What 's the sky Taro already sleeping ? 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 I'd become composition went open in the same way 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 It will assemble a little 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:07.300
 Yes assembly complete a totally ne- 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.530
 It is big but I'm the same structure as the guy that I always use 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:17.620
 It kinda Well then is the floor with fine 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.850
 When I hit a certain color table, I would like to compare them a little, or put them side by side to high 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.200
 Hey pretty difference 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:29.850
 First of all even if the height is about 5 times better 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.250
 0 for a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.130
 area 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.130
 If there is area waking up there will be nearly double 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.530
 It is so different 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 Depending on the land and chairs used 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:56.380
 It's hard to say which one is comfortable, but the height is a difficult place 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.150
 In Ben Stone, it may be as much as a uni-frame bonfire table 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.360
 It is a good machine 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:08.860
 It is quite good 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:14.470
 It's like this The length of the warmth is different only by the loss, so I'll take it on a little bike 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:18.610
 The kana inconvenient little I'd want this song a little but it is do too large to carry 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.290
 There was no problem if it was just a car 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:27.349
 I seem to be easy to use 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.819

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.790
