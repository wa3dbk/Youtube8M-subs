come<00:01:16.080> together<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> make<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
come together the right time and make a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640

I<00:01:59.789> think<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.030> Golden<00:02:01.329> State<00:02:01.539> Warriors

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
I think that the Golden State Warriors

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.690 
I think that the Golden State Warriors
in<00:02:02.110> Atlanta<00:02:02.530> Hawks<00:02:02.740> are<00:02:02.950> gonna<00:02:03.100> make<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.520> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
in Atlanta Hawks are gonna make it to

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.830 
the NBA Finals I know a lot of people
think<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.159> Houston<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.030> way<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.509> Golden

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
think that Houston is in a way of Golden

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.839 
think that Houston is in a way of Golden
State<00:02:08.050> but<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.619> my<00:02:08.769> knowledge<00:02:08.819> Golden<00:02:09.819> State

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
State but to my knowledge Golden State

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.630 
State but to my knowledge Golden State
has<00:02:10.000> swept<00:02:10.390> Houston<00:02:10.869> all<00:02:11.140> season<00:02:11.890> long<00:02:12.040> now<00:02:12.610> I

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
has swept Houston all season long now I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.729 
has swept Houston all season long now I
know<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:13.030> LeBron<00:02:13.390> James<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.959> LeBron<00:02:14.349> James

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
know that LeBron James is LeBron James

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.130 
know that LeBron James is LeBron James
but<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.519> Hawks<00:02:15.760> lead<00:02:16.000> their<00:02:16.269> season<00:02:16.660> series<00:02:16.840> 3

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
but the Hawks lead their season series 3

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.870 
but the Hawks lead their season series 3
2<00:02:17.200> 1<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.950> know<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.160> lot<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.430> people<00:02:18.519> are<00:02:18.760> gonna

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
2 1 and I know a lot of people are gonna

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.880 
2 1 and I know a lot of people are gonna
see<00:02:19.090> what<00:02:19.269> playoff<00:02:19.510> basketball<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.440> different

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
see what playoff basketball is different

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.710 
see what playoff basketball is different
but<00:02:21.250> don't<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.610> think<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.970> number<00:02:22.239> one<00:02:22.420> seeds

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
but don't you think the number one seeds

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.229 
but don't you think the number one seeds
would<00:02:23.080> turn<00:02:23.470> up<00:02:23.709> now<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.700> think<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
would turn up now I think that the

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.150 
would turn up now I think that the
outcome<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.019> game<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:26.560> probably<00:02:26.920> be

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
outcome for this game will probably be

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600 
outcome for this game will probably be
four<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.209> two<00:02:28.480> Golden<00:02:29.470> State's<00:02:29.739> favor<00:02:30.010> now<00:02:30.580> I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
four to two Golden State's favor now I

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.640 
four to two Golden State's favor now I
know<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.940> Golden<00:02:31.599> State<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.049> Atlanta<00:02:32.200> Hawks

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
know that Golden State and Atlanta Hawks

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.680 
know that Golden State and Atlanta Hawks
split<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.099> season<00:02:33.280> 11<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.390> haven't

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
it will end up being from the East the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.330 
it will end up being from the East the
Chicago<00:03:06.130> Bulls<00:03:06.609> will<00:03:07.450> use<00:03:08.440> their<00:03:08.650> experience

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
Chicago Bulls will use their experience

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.970 
Chicago Bulls will use their experience
and<00:03:09.519> their<00:03:09.579> fantastic<00:03:10.540> defensive<00:03:11.019> coach<00:03:11.709> in

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and their fantastic defensive coach in

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.860 
and their fantastic defensive coach in
Tom<00:03:12.010> Thibodeau<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.850> be<00:03:13.389> buoyed<00:03:13.600> by<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
Tom Thibodeau and be buoyed by the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.020 
Tom Thibodeau and be buoyed by the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
return of even a half-strength Derrick

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.970 
return of even a half-strength Derrick
Rose<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.569> think<00:03:17.139> that<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.380> Bulls<00:03:17.650> are<00:03:17.799> gonna

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
Rose I think that the Bulls are gonna

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
Rose I think that the Bulls are gonna
make<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.400> out<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.790> East<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.269> may<00:03:19.480> rub

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
make it out of the East that may rub

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.509 
make it out of the East that may rub
some<00:03:19.989> people<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.260> wrong<00:03:20.319> way<00:03:20.500> but<00:03:21.160> remember

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
some people the wrong way but remember

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.129 
some people the wrong way but remember
the<00:03:21.850> first<00:03:22.090> year<00:03:22.329> that<00:03:22.359> LeBron<00:03:22.750> was<00:03:22.930> on<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
the first year that LeBron was on the

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.690 
the first year that LeBron was on the
heat<00:03:23.319> they<00:03:23.530> didn't<00:03:23.829> win<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> championship

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
heat they didn't win the championship

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.849 
heat they didn't win the championship
either<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.359> Cavaliers<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:26.319> next

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
either so the Cavaliers I think next

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.069 
either so the Cavaliers I think next
year<00:03:27.250> they're<00:03:27.730> gonna<00:03:27.880> tear<00:03:28.180> everybody<00:03:28.389> up<00:03:28.840> but

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
year they're gonna tear everybody up but

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.050 
year they're gonna tear everybody up but
i<00:03:29.109> think<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.530> year<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:30.280> inexperience<00:03:30.970> of

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
i think this year the inexperience of

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.319 
i think this year the inexperience of
the<00:03:31.660> Hawks<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.230> Cavaliers<00:03:32.769> as<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.639> unit<00:03:34.180> in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
the Hawks and the Cavaliers as a unit in

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.539 
the Hawks and the Cavaliers as a unit in
being<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.079> deep<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.470> playoffs<00:03:35.650> will

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
being so deep in the playoffs will

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.280 
being so deep in the playoffs will
eventually<00:03:37.359> come<00:03:37.510> back<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.840> haunt<00:03:37.959> them<00:03:38.109> i

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
eventually come back to haunt them i

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
eventually come back to haunt them i
think<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.590> Bulls<00:03:38.799> are<00:03:38.950> ready<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.400> i<00:03:39.730> think

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
think the Bulls are ready and i think

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.569 
think the Bulls are ready and i think
that<00:03:40.150> rose<00:03:40.389> will<00:03:40.720> be<00:03:40.750> ready<00:03:41.290> enough<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:42.370> help

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
that rose will be ready enough to help

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.210 
that rose will be ready enough to help
share<00:03:43.299> some<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.780> load<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.530> then<00:03:44.950> the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
share some of that load and then the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.099 
share some of that load and then the
defense<00:03:45.700> matters<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.450> playoffs<00:03:46.840> that's

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
defense matters in the playoffs that's

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.259 
defense matters in the playoffs that's
the<00:03:47.319> big<00:03:47.530> thing<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:48.370> keep<00:03:48.549> that<00:03:48.609> in<00:03:48.760> mind<00:03:49.060> as<00:03:49.239> we

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
the big thing so keep that in mind as we

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.390 
the big thing so keep that in mind as we
move<00:03:49.420> over<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.109> west<00:03:50.319> i<00:03:50.620> think<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.370> is

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
move over to the west i think that it is

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.550 
move over to the west i think that it is
going<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.910> be<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.150> San<00:03:52.359> Antonio<00:03:52.480> Spurs<00:03:52.810> coming

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
going to be the San Antonio Spurs coming

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.650 
going to be the San Antonio Spurs coming
out<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.920> West<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.340> think<00:03:54.940> once<00:03:55.180> again<00:03:55.480> that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
out of the West I think once again that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.960 
out of the West I think once again that
experience<00:03:56.230> wins<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> Spurs<00:03:57.669> will

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
experience wins and that the Spurs will

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.420 
experience wins and that the Spurs will
end<00:03:58.180> up<00:03:58.359> being<00:03:58.389> the<00:03:59.290> Bulls<00:03:59.590> opponents<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
end up being the Bulls opponents in the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.220 
end up being the Bulls opponents in the
finals<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.239> those<00:04:01.540> two<00:04:01.599> will<00:04:02.049> match

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
finals so I think those two will match

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.080 
finals so I think those two will match
up<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:03.099> think<00:04:03.160> at<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.579> end<00:04:03.609> of<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.880> day

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
up and I think at the end of the day

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.210 
up and I think at the end of the day
it'll<00:04:04.299> be<00:04:04.480> about<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.750> 4-2<00:04:05.380> series<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.160> do

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
it'll be about a 4-2 series and I do

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.789 
it'll be about a 4-2 series and I do
think<00:04:06.579> San<00:04:06.849> Antonio<00:04:07.329> will<00:04:07.599> prevail<00:04:07.989> they<00:04:08.620> will

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
think San Antonio will prevail they will

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.400 
think San Antonio will prevail they will
ride<00:04:08.980> off<00:04:09.129> into<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> sunset

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
ride off into the sunset

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.350 
ride off into the sunset
