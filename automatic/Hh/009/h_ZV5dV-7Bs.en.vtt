aside<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> concept<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
aside right now the concept that is it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
aside right now the concept that is it
used<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.969> open<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.300> box<00:00:42.540> has<00:00:42.750> been<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
used to open this box has been around a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
used to open this box has been around a
long<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.890> did<00:00:44.070> try<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> little

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
long time we did try to do it a little

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
long time we did try to do it a little
bit<00:00:45.329> better<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.550> we'll<00:00:48.030> show<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
bit better I think and we'll show you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
bit better I think and we'll show you
how<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.809> done<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:49.370> any<00:00:50.370> amount<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> movement

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
how it's done now any amount of movement

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.619 
how it's done now any amount of movement
really<00:00:51.570> isn't<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:52.789> resulting<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.059> much

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
really isn't good resulting in much

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
really isn't good resulting in much
happening<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.739> press<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
happening here you can press you can

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
happening here you can press you can
pull<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.260> real<00:00:58.530> hard<00:00:58.559> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pull you can you can try real hard but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
pull you can you can try real hard but
it's<00:00:59.430> actually<00:00:59.730> pretty<00:00:59.910> simple<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
it's actually pretty simple when you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.130 
it's actually pretty simple when you
know<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.789> if<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.969> take<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.390> box<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
know what to do if I take this box and I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.520 
know what to do if I take this box and I
give<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> good<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.979> spin<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.290> comes

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
give it a good little spin the top comes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.120 
give it a good little spin the top comes
right<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:08.420> isn't<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.689> cool

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
right off isn't that cool

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.510 
right off isn't that cool
what's<00:01:11.130> happening<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:13.080> these<00:01:13.409> blocks<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
what's happening is in these blocks of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
what's happening is in these blocks of
wood<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.680> sapele

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
wood here this is I think this is sapele

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.770 
wood here this is I think this is sapele
but<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.580> might<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.850> mahogany<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.570> nice

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
but we might use mahogany some nice

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.670 
but we might use mahogany some nice
hardwood<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.189> six<00:01:21.290> stainless<00:01:22.290> steel

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
hardwood there are six stainless steel

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.390 
hardwood there are six stainless steel
pins<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> nice<00:01:28.350> quality<00:01:28.799> pin<00:01:29.220> here

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
pins you get a nice quality pin here

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100 
pins you get a nice quality pin here
that's<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.700> last<00:01:29.939> forever

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that's gonna last forever

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.280 
that's gonna last forever
and<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.590> notice<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.290> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and they notice they move in and out and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
and they notice they move in and out and
they'll<00:01:34.470> move<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> slot<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
they'll move into this slot which is in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.890 
they'll move into this slot which is in
the<00:01:36.540> top<00:01:36.570> block<00:01:36.990> glued<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> cover<00:01:38.900> unless

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the top block glued to the cover unless

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
the top block glued to the cover unless
these<00:01:40.110> pins<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> outside<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
these pins are all on the outside at the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.719 
these pins are all on the outside at the
same<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> cannot<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
same time like so you cannot take the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
same time like so you cannot take the
box<00:01:44.939> cover<00:01:45.329> off<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.340> a

box cover off if there's if there's a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.770 
box cover off if there's if there's a
couple<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> them<00:01:47.880> sticking<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
couple of them sticking out like this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
couple of them sticking out like this
they're<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> grab<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.220> Ridge

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
they're just going to grab in this Ridge

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.850 
they're just going to grab in this Ridge
and<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.000> won't<00:01:51.210> come<00:01:51.390> off

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
and it won't come off

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.319 
and it won't come off
so<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> secret<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.610> centrifugal

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so the secret is to use centrifugal

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.980 
so the secret is to use centrifugal
force<00:01:54.780> by<00:01:55.649> spinning<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.540> spinning

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
force by spinning you know my spinning

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
force by spinning you know my spinning
these<00:01:58.140> things<00:01:58.469> immediately<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.460> pins<00:01:59.670> move

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
these things immediately the pins move

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.700 
these things immediately the pins move
to<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> outside<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.229> take<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> cover

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to the outside and I can take the cover

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.039 
to the outside and I can take the cover
off<00:02:01.969> it's<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.030> technique<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> spin<00:02:03.719> around<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
off it's a technique to spin around a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.359 
off it's a technique to spin around a
long<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.590> most<00:02:04.799> people<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.250> not

Florida<00:02:41.040> shop<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.959> I've<00:02:43.709> used<00:02:43.769> floorboard

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
Florida shop is I've used floorboard

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.539 
Florida shop is I've used floorboard
material<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.380> made<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> couple<00:02:46.650> samples<00:02:47.160> using

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
material I made a couple samples using

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.120 
material I made a couple samples using
the<00:02:47.790> cherry<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:49.080> dawned<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.530> me<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.010> with

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the cherry and it dawned on me that with

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.309 
the cherry and it dawned on me that with
enough<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.030> know<00:02:51.150> spinning<00:02:51.780> action<00:02:51.989> on<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
enough you know spinning action on a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.350 
enough you know spinning action on a
surface<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.010> probably<00:02:53.160> gonna<00:02:53.459> mark<00:02:53.849> up<00:02:54.060> that

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
surface is probably gonna mark up that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.800 
surface is probably gonna mark up that
the<00:02:55.260> cherry<00:02:55.530> pretty<00:02:55.860> good<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.269> decided<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the cherry pretty good so I decided to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.600 
the cherry pretty good so I decided to
it's<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> little<00:02:58.290> bit<00:02:58.590> more<00:02:58.769> difficult<00:02:59.340> that's

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it's a little bit more difficult that's

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.910 
it's a little bit more difficult that's
very<00:02:59.849> difficult<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.360> cut<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.810> floor<00:03:01.650> board

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
very difficult to cut this floor board

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.860 
very difficult to cut this floor board
but<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.610> floor<00:03:02.849> board<00:03:03.060> material<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.690> course

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
but the floor board material of course

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.229 
but the floor board material of course
is<00:03:04.019> extremely<00:03:04.769> rugged<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.610> very<00:03:05.880> scratch

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
is extremely rugged it's very scratch
