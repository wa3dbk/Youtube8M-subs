00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
one does not look a lot different than

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.590 
one does not look a lot different than
the<00:02:17.530> peachy<00:02:17.890> color<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:19.060> still<00:02:19.330> going<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
the peachy color but it's still going to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.590 
the peachy color but it's still going to
serve<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.959> purpose<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.300> help

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
serve a purpose it's going to help

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.750 
serve a purpose it's going to help
transition<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> darker<00:02:25.239> color<00:02:25.450> later<00:02:27.810> see

a little bit nuts so that it's not
completely<00:02:48.519> soaking<00:02:48.940> wet<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.610> one

completely soaking wet and then this one
I'm<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.330> straight<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.459> next<00:02:54.459> to

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
I'm going to go straight to the next to

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.699 
I'm going to go straight to the next to
the<00:02:54.670> cuticle<00:02:55.260> because<00:02:56.260> that's<00:02:56.410> where<00:02:56.590> it's

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
the cuticle because that's where it's

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.370 
the cuticle because that's where it's
going<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.860> end<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.250> darkest<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.230> then<00:02:59.230> as

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
going to end up the darkest and then as

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.289 
going to end up the darkest and then as
you<00:02:59.410> dab<00:02:59.739> out<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:01.450> will<00:03:01.690> get<00:03:01.870> lighter<00:03:02.230> ok<00:03:03.299> then

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
you dab out it will get lighter ok then

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.270 
you dab out it will get lighter ok then
I'll<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.660> turn<00:03:05.140> sideways<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.980> start

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
I'll to turn sideways and start

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.800 
I'll to turn sideways and start
overlapping<00:03:08.519> okay

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.470 

and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:13.130> what<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.400> sometimes<00:03:13.940> they'll

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and then what I do sometimes they'll

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.390 
and then what I do sometimes they'll
take<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:14.840> darker<00:03:15.290> color<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.860> really<00:03:16.250> just

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
take this darker color and really just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.180 
take this darker color and really just
very<00:03:16.760> gently<00:03:16.849> tap<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.840> little<00:03:18.500> bit<00:03:18.620> all<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.099> way

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
very gently tap a little bit all the way

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.370 
very gently tap a little bit all the way
down<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.610> nail<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.050> helps<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
down the nail just so that it helps to

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.370 
down the nail just so that it helps to
blend<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.860> little<00:03:21.890> bit<00:03:22.280> okay<00:03:23.150> then<00:03:23.900> if

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
blend it a little bit okay then if

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.839 
blend it a little bit okay then if
there's<00:03:24.560> any<00:03:24.739> colors<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.400> don't<00:03:25.640> like

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
there's any colors that you don't like

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.820 
there's any colors that you don't like
you<00:03:26.239> know<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.569> aren't<00:03:26.810> dark<00:03:27.140> enough<00:03:27.380> for<00:03:27.680> you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
you know that aren't dark enough for you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.589 
you know that aren't dark enough for you
or<00:03:28.190> didn't<00:03:28.519> come<00:03:28.670> out<00:03:28.700> exactly<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.390> way<00:03:29.480> you

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
or didn't come out exactly the way you

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.110 
or didn't come out exactly the way you
want<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.200> want<00:03:30.410> them<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.860> can<00:03:31.370> go<00:03:31.580> back<00:03:31.760> over

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
want you want them you can go back over

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.390 
want you want them you can go back over
them<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.160> always<00:03:34.610> take<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.030> kind<00:03:35.599> of

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
them so I can always take this kind of

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.130 
them so I can always take this kind of
the<00:03:37.400> next<00:03:37.670> color<00:03:37.880> lighter<00:03:38.239> than<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.630> purple

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
the next color lighter than the purple

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.100 
the next color lighter than the purple
and<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.410> can<00:03:39.590> dev<00:03:39.769> right<00:03:40.010> over<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:41.110> create

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
and I can dev right over that and create

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.340 
and I can dev right over that and create
you<00:03:42.680> know<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.730> fade<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.230> that

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
you know the fade so that it's so that

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.199 
you know the fade so that it's so that
the<00:03:45.560> gradient<00:03:45.769> is<00:03:46.130> exactly<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.700> way<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.850> want

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
the gradient is exactly the way you want

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.559 
the gradient is exactly the way you want
it<00:03:47.330> okay<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:49.040> again<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.910> okay<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:50.390> it's<00:03:50.420> a

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
it okay but again it's okay that it's a

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.479 
it okay but again it's okay that it's a
little<00:03:50.600> bit<00:03:50.810> messy<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.620> part<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.040> nothing<00:03:52.340> to

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
little bit messy that part is nothing to

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.360 
little bit messy that part is nothing to
worry<00:03:52.670> about<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.840> then<00:03:54.769> next<00:03:54.920> I'm<00:03:55.190> going<00:03:55.310> to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
worry about and then next I'm going to

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.180 
worry about and then next I'm going to
go<00:03:55.519> over<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.360> entire<00:03:56.720> nail<00:03:57.019> with<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.769> yellow

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
go over the entire nail with the yellow

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.970 
go over the entire nail with the yellow
polish<00:03:58.970> because<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.410> only<00:04:00.500> one<00:04:00.860> of

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
polish because it's the only one of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.640 
polish because it's the only one of
these<00:04:01.180> for<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.450> has<00:04:02.599> any<00:04:02.810> kind<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:03.080> sparkle

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
these for that has any kind of sparkle

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.210 
these for that has any kind of sparkle
and<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.549> does<00:04:04.760> then<00:04:05.660> tend<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:06.470> blend<00:04:06.799> all<00:04:07.040> the

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and it does then tend to blend all the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.280 
and it does then tend to blend all the
colors<00:04:07.549> together<00:04:07.819> nice<00:04:08.239> lake<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> little

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
colors together nice lake is a little

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.449 
colors together nice lake is a little
bit<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.500> sparkle<00:04:09.890> which<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.190> going<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> make

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
bit of sparkle which is going to make

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.300 
bit of sparkle which is going to make
