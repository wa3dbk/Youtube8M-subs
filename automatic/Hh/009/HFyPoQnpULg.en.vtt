00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everybody today I make another video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.819
 first I'd be crazy school though 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
 probably when i load this 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.349
 video I will be all your school visa 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
 that my school has decided to open 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.240
 the September act because he was early 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 so yes anyway I load it 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.730
 will charge because I know these people 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.470
 be after 8 September 11 15 12 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.960
 so in this case the home video 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 back to school he is doing is one of the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 pieces to see these things I 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 bought for the return to school yes 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.760
 hope he can somehow say it is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.280
 interesting because it becomes a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.770
 falconer to look for these things then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 I feel limited to further pupils 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 start to show things 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 So this year I told you far away 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.649
 first of all this is yours 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 Backpack pac and I have taken seems to me that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 sits in the projection I don't know why 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.870
 a dream however was not there and will take 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.670
 a black bank with these blue butterflies 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.360
 let's say with some purple structure 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.979
 above and personally the smell 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.470
 and therefore we are piacenza against the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.299
 ponsacco and not only does the game begin 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.460
 quality to defend one of those attentive 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.619
 normal life then i saw this ones 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.380
 bow tie because I'm in love 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.539
 so this was the first written one 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.700
 I seem darker occurs then I 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.649
 obviously bought the diary 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.869
 and I like to take that of the child 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.759
 every ammerman when adriano the site is 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.000
 present if you don't know that 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.009
 brand making diaries case backpacks 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.409
 completely white because you can 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.600
 draw and write on and I already have it 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.520
 decorate mine though maybe define it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.530
 however most of these 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.289
 a deliberate this is a diary of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.619
 this year and to do so he decided to 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.439
 cover it with almost bows and yours 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.020
 to cover it with incitements 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.179
 of songs bboa customers for example 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.970
 here there is a situation of guilt of 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.179
 stars this case all maid of our 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.009
 stars is that it increases castellation 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.720
 then this is the silver of snow 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.750
 venturi believe in ordinari axa more 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.120
 books this russelsheim always said 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:21.880
 blends a phrase that I like a 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:25.390
 lot bb editing fearless for me 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.780
 like and aido thesis and guiteras these of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.650
 looking for it expired batteries of these this 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.319
 quote below is of decline and broad beans 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.350
 this purchase before the sessions in which 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.010
 a bit of books 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.750
 the songs in those things as well as 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.460
 it wasn't enough of space outside and it has me 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
 said if you think you are too cute, some of them 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.800
 they have tightened a product and therefore also 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.510
 this is billions this year and now 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.880
 demonstrates all the material you bought 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.770
 a thing for itself saying a pack 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.840
 if but who you as I two sisters there 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.020
 we are today says things to you then a 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.460
 I have touched two of them it seems to me 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.530
 marcallo jean because we went to 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.070
 take them black 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:14.150
 obviously a package of you and you are me 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:17.600
 touch me are played 60 18 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.250
 so these are good here and there is one 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.750
 green black blue simple run 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.610
 very simple temples and pixar cars 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.710
 filled as he writes so I lose so 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.500
 always this or a pair of scissors 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.910
 fuchsia because genoa all connected to 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.170
 how they resisted 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.600
 I don't think it was because at school 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.700
 but at home when he did odd jobs 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.530
 things did n't help a couple of ago 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.430
 close because I was going to propagate 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.760
 misery 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.550
 then the left we took a glue 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 head 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.930
 beautiful note reminds one 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.120
 the bowl of the pay for me is me 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 it seems so because I think they are the best 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.370
 more or less 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.780
 then I took this pack with 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:07.220
 four since he was born as a quarry yes 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.390
 call and wins 4 highlighter starts 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.520
 this green areas thalberg be 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.960
 sincere for costoniane with pencils on 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.910
 books because I did n't like it while 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.070
 some disagreements however when i do 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.140
 my dots my patterns as such for 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.530
 studying the collection would be pd thinkers 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.940
 on the cholera must that they know that 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.150
 these are from Calabria 's 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.900
 luciano then in this time and wine a 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.220
 this appointment is here because not 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 there was ours a white rubber 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.060
 then very normal as when we do 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.310
 already while in the classroom must always be a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.160
 looking for rulers are pressing 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.780
 fading light things because doing 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.580
 drawn a huge folder though 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.320
 Portanese repressed with a folder 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.140
 then find a little impossible pre 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.560
 uncomfortable so I got this set 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.050
 here that there is in which small and the 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.640
 small level and I am also 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.710
 very bad because this gift is so 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.390
 especially with trani inside the strip 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.050
 how much taste m year 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.560
 delete casilino just cross and then 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.560
 I got a lot of which each one 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.740
 it looks like the tv offer from jean se 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.260
 you took 10 notebooks of pahlavi 4 to 10 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.110
 so they were less than a euro like me 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.930
 it seems enough but one thing and I have one 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.910
 took the 10 checkered and also says 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.190
 very normal without making you 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.740
 see faces of being one like this 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:39.980
 a fact that I do not think of this life 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.510
 I know I like it too much so it seems 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.180
 that I will be for a chain more in the face 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.710
 because when I see a notebook with the 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.920
 nice thing i have to do with something 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.590
 which I always like the normal thing for 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.560
 last thing i took one of those blocks 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:00.200
 with the rings in white that I took it 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:04.430
 and to 120 sheets in fact do not know if sti 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.770
 but the huge guy lies and told me 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 I got from a school fort from one 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.870
 part also that is not the same as we say 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.820
 that when I have to take notes hurry 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.600
 various steve test dictates something or 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.460
 when to study when I have to do a theme 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.840
 so I always have to make a bad copy 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.370
 because I am a super person 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.410
 messy so if I do n't do it 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.650
 bad copy before stuff comes out 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.380
 readable and therefore I like it 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.910
 use these tricks with clarets 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.569
 because then when maybe the year ends 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.240
 when 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.679
 reserves something after a while time knows 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.749
 always where to find it again 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:41.300
 expiring that mixes a little sad 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.619
 very convenient reporter and I like it 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.240
 also to bring the team when 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:47.029
 maybe I get bored for a while 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.330
 insignia the block they see 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:53.539
 last year full notes 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.059
 drawings for anything student 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.999
 stories written at home the hours of 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:01.459
 religion was nothing so to speak 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:05.209
 like to take me every year but then this one 

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:08.029
 gigantic part and this was all for 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:11.569
 my or back to school cancer 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:13.490
 of the child every thing and nothing I hope 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.369
 may have been useful in some 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.749
 so that there is simply no 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:19.520
 interested last schito something like this 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:21.979
 if you want leave me a comment a 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.419
 telling me what you bought for yourself 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.759
 your back to school as you are 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.990
 preparing and maybe if you want some 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.149
 another video if I return to school ad 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.069
 example I was thinking of making a video 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.349
 with paid tips for those who start 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.119
 in high school 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:38.209
 so for those who must do or for whom 

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:39.709
 anyway mine but maybe 

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:43.509
 tell me a comment if you could 

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:46.309
 interesting that nothing I think this 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:47.740
 so thank you for watching the video vi 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:50.740

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.740
 Hello
