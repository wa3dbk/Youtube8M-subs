00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.719
 and the 6 11 strikeouts and we are Barcelona 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.820
 We were looking for a flat and one of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.560
 options we had was to buy a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.170
 floor to reform and first what 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.110
 we try to find out how much could 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 get to cost us a reform and so 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.090
 we come to you we see an ad in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 the photocasa portal of the reform plan 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.250
 Calculate how much it would cost to renew your 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.820
 house we click there and we meet 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.579
 with the calculator we went filling 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.110
 until we got the approximate value 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.560
 of what we could get 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.760
 to pay for that reform the calculator 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.429
 it was almost accurate 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.820
 and we send our request for 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.750
 information and they began to arrive we 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.320
 different proposals to make 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 our eyes 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.640
 we found very easy to identify 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 the relevant information we to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.280
 through the reform plan form you 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.320
 makes you say very concrete things that are 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.750
 on what the professionals that are based 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.670
 you have on the web then they will 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.500
 they answer based on that and all the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.530
 proposals you receive 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.619
 they have the same concepts is painting 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.180
 both paleteria both facilities 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.280
 so much then it's super easy to 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.720
 compare what happened to us with the rest 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.940
 of budgets and is that every 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.270
 professional calls things how he wants 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.340
 a little bit in the reform plan 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.360
 the information already presents you 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.770
 presents everything and everything the same and we 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.770
 makes expressions very easy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.500
 and we took it out we would do it and I think that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.500
 we have commented it with several friends 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
 Y
