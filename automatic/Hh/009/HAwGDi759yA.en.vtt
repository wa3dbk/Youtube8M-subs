successful in that we are the sons of
pressure<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.330> mean<00:00:21.890> you're<00:00:22.890> pretty<00:00:23.070> much<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
pressure I mean you're pretty much the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.839 
pressure I mean you're pretty much the
team's<00:00:23.670> backbone<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.160> I<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.670> that's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
team's backbone right and I think that's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
team's backbone right and I think that's
why<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.300> play<00:00:27.539> play<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> game<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
why we all play play the game for the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.939 
why we all play play the game for the
pressure<00:00:29.580> sometimes<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> takes<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
pressure sometimes I think it takes a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
pressure sometimes I think it takes a
lot<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> hard<00:00:32.369> work<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.140> strong
