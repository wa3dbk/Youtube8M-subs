00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
how these plants work and so it's

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.040 
how these plants work and so it's
something<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.819> you<00:00:50.329> you<00:00:50.690> need<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:50.899> utilize

something that you you need to utilize
and<00:00:51.589> prepare<00:00:51.949> in<00:00:52.069> a<00:00:52.129> certain<00:00:52.339> we<00:00:52.399> can't<00:00:52.579> just

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
and prepare in a certain we can't just

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.279 
and prepare in a certain we can't just
you<00:00:53.059> know<00:00:53.120> sit<00:00:53.359> next<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.659> this<00:00:53.839> plan<00:00:54.170> and

all these different cultivars and wild

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.590 
all these different cultivars and wild
plants<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.249> need<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.489> either<00:00:58.579> crush<00:00:59.239> them<00:00:59.479> up

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
plants you need to either crush them up

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.040 
plants you need to either crush them up
until<00:00:59.839> they<00:00:59.899> get<00:00:59.989> juicy<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.649> put<00:01:00.979> those<00:01:01.129> plant

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050

can light on fire and let it smoke and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.030 
can light on fire and let it smoke and
we<00:01:08.360> call<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.659> smudge<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.259> that<00:01:09.530> smoke<00:01:09.829> then

we call it a smudge and that smoke then

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.950 
we call it a smudge and that smoke then
will<00:01:10.189> get<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.460> air<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.880> repel<00:01:11.210> them<00:01:11.420> or

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
will get in the air and repel them or

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.510 
will get in the air and repel them or

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.820 
I'll try and bring this closer to the
camera<00:04:46.199> so<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.560> can<00:04:46.650> see<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.530> it's<00:04:49.680> got

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
camera so you can see and so it's got

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.300 
camera so you can see and so it's got
this<00:04:50.010> flower<00:04:50.789> head<00:04:51.289> that's<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:53.010> don't<00:04:53.159> have

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
this flower head that's you don't have

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.980 
this flower head that's you don't have
distinguishable<00:04:53.970> petals<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.810> flower

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
distinguishable petals so the flower

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.540 
distinguishable petals so the flower
head<00:04:55.409> is<00:04:55.530> called<00:04:55.710> parts<00:04:56.010> indistinguishable

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
head is called parts indistinguishable

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.420 
head is called parts indistinguishable
and<00:04:57.060> then<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:58.110> branches<00:04:59.039> come<00:04:59.250> off

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
and then the little branches come off

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.480 
and then the little branches come off
alternately<00:05:00.259> singly<00:05:01.259> off<00:05:01.409> the<00:05:01.560> stem<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.979> then

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
alternately singly off the stem and then

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.089 
alternately singly off the stem and then
those<00:05:02.699> little<00:05:02.759> leaves<00:05:03.150> they<00:05:03.479> divide<00:05:03.900> out<00:05:04.139> into

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
those little leaves they divide out into

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.730 
those little leaves they divide out into
little<00:05:05.220> leaflets<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.900> they're<00:05:07.050> either<00:05:07.139> deeply

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
little leaflets so they're either deeply

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:18.260 
little leaflets so they're either deeply
divided<00:05:08.220> or<00:05:08.960> are<00:05:09.960> branching<00:05:10.860> into<00:05:10.949> leaflets
