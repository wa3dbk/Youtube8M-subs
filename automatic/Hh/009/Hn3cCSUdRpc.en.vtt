00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
a 16 by 16 like that this was called a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.199 
a 16 by 16 like that this was called a
fusion<00:02:29.590> kit<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.490> doesn't<00:02:30.760> sound<00:02:30.880> anything

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209

like<00:02:31.360> that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
like that

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140 
like that
the<00:02:32.260> Tom<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:33.340> really<00:02:33.520> big<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.030> was

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the Tom so I'm really big and I was

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.350 
the Tom so I'm really big and I was
happy<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.690> um<00:02:36.990> yeah<00:02:37.990> uh<00:02:39.240> what<00:02:40.240> else

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
happy with that um yeah uh what else

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.080 
happy with that um yeah uh what else
okay<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:40.810> let's<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> cymbals<00:02:41.740> uh<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.820> was

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
okay so let's go to the cymbals uh I was

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.580 
okay so let's go to the cymbals uh I was
pretty<00:02:43.120> happy<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> cymbal<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.290> could<00:02:44.470> be

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
pretty happy with the cymbal I could be

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.780 
pretty happy with the cymbal I could be
a<00:02:44.620> little<00:02:44.770> more<00:02:44.980> happy<00:02:45.250> with<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> way<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
a little more happy with the way it

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.490 
a little more happy with the way it
sounds<00:02:46.090> closed<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:47.080> that'll<00:02:47.350> get

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
sounds closed but I think that'll get

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.040 
sounds closed but I think that'll get
better<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.490> more<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.820> play<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.390> once<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.750> break

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
better the more I play like once I break

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.449 
better the more I play like once I break
it<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.410> little<00:02:50.709> bit<00:02:50.830> I'm<00:02:50.980> hoping<00:02:51.280> at<00:02:51.430> least

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it in a little bit I'm hoping at least

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.560 
it in a little bit I'm hoping at least
but<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.209> sounds<00:02:52.480> good<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:54.570> that's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
but it sounds good I like it that's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:06.960 
but it sounds good I like it that's
closed<00:02:58.080> like<00:02:59.080> half<00:02:59.350> closed<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.190> then<00:03:05.430> okay<00:03:06.430> so

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
closed like half closed and then okay so

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.170 
closed like half closed and then okay so
there's<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:09.100> for<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.790> Zildjian

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
there's that and then for the Zildjian

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.630 
there's that and then for the Zildjian
gbt<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:11.530> pretty<00:03:11.800> old<00:03:11.980> I'm<00:03:12.190> probably<00:03:12.250> gonna

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
gbt it's pretty old I'm probably gonna

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.960
