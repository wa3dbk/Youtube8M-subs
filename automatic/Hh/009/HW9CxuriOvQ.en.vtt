 heart until you find eight 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.109
 melodies that make up this song 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.969
 er bone beginnings is an unusual rpg 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.280
 the rest because instead of powerful 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.469
 magic knights or futuristic technology 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.149
 we find ourselves with a normal world and 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.979
 current where the characters are 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.079
 inhabitants of our time but yes 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 Always full of humor and with an aspect 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.740
 cartoon but that hits the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.539
 pair with extraterrestrial ghosts or 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.640
 robots doing a mix a bit 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.350
 special although during the game we will go 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 seeing that this title does not just bring 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.429
 moments of humor but also moments 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.679
 bitter or sad the argument and its 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.390
 development are the culmination of the title and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 that is a unique story and really 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.319
 original totally extrapolated to 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.420
 aspect of the graphic section of which a 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.510
 Once immersed in it , we will forget 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.459
 full 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.110
 against the battle system it 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.090
 will take turns as it is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 develop any rpg with 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.750
 the five powers of the characters 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.640
 current objects used in very different ways 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.560
 originals and special commands 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.659
 battles are also something to highlight 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.280
 since you have to be very attentive to the ether 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.560
 even higher where the battle is indicated 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.360
 sometimes the enemies apart from 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 attack and fail can be scheming 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.140
 a superior attack or some decrease of 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 our statistics and with messages 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.069
 such as he smiled slightly or is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.019
 evaluating the situation we can do 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.940
 unit of an imminent attack but not 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.129
 you have to be alarmed they lie they will not be 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.140
 only in these battles we have the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.840
 help from anna an outstanding girl and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.099
 apt for the psychic powers lloyd a 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.930
 poor boy marginalized but 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.810
 incredibly skilled for mechanics and 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.489
 handling of explosive objects and ted and a 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.250
 street hooligan but big-hearted 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.170
 as much as his fists we also have 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.909
 of multiple elements of today 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.799
 at our disposal as hotels or 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.930
 hospitals where to rest and heal from 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.370
 the adversities or hanging vests and 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.889
 bates as equipment to improve 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.930
 our characteristics to be a 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.790
 8-bit title is quite complex and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.930
 wide full of events and tasks by 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.430
 solve something that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.409
 the titles of nes could boast 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.510
 besides having a great band 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.890
 sonora marchosa and archiconocida by the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.599
 players but that is also going 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.549
 adapt to moments of tension or 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.560
 Graphically, it stands out for its 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.939
 immense scenarios and battles for 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.010
 misfortune lack those funds 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.719
 psychedelics of your future deliveries and 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.760
 that could not be generated with the power 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.530
 of les arts bomber innings entails 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.129
 many curiosities and data to discover 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 here we surprise you with some goods 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.579
 the company that worked together and toy in 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.409
 the saga mother and that later 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.909
 evolved to create tours which is 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.500
 known by pokemon 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.879
 this is where we can notice the skimming 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.560
 in the development of some of the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.079
 pocket monsters with the characters 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.849
 of this title for the development of 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.709
 game was taken as reference to 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.540
 movies like 'the goonies' ete or 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.099
 tell me about stephen king for 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.200
 think that the protagonists of herbón 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.790
 beginnings were children you are still attentive and 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.650
 introduced to miyamoto the prototype of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.329
 mother to try it and this one was 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 so satisfied with the idea that he wanted 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.590
 almost the game immediately and after nights 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.120
 without sleep developing the landmark title 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.740
 and he made the mistake of erasing all the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.539
 development and have to start from 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.880
 zero losing the opportunity to be the 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.680
 first rpg on famicom it today is a 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.360
 very recognized character in japan so much 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.979
 that even in a fifth chapter more 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.780
 they do not know how to promote their 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.949
 business and they try to copy so 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.949
 comical the announcement of mother 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.800
 the song of the credits the game boy 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.450
 camera is the same song that we can 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.230
 listen in the bomber innings in the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.230
 twinkle school 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.710
 ah 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.910
 the down beginning is more than a game is 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.310
 a story is a feeling a rpg 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.590
 unique and unrepeatable that is already 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.080
 available the nintendo wii iso and the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.440
 time to play remember not to cry 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.440
 the end
