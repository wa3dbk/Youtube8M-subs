solo to wish you were here you remember
the<00:00:06.060> first<00:00:06.330> bit<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:07.020> sliding<00:00:07.290> from<00:00:07.560> two<00:00:07.770> to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
the first bit we're sliding from two to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
the first bit we're sliding from two to
four<00:00:08.690> I've<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.990> third<00:00:10.230> fret<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> B

SiC<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:34.960> freedom<00:00:35.290> hi<00:00:35.470> string

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.530 

next<00:00:50.440> pack<00:00:50.650> goes<00:00:56.820> okay<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:57.880> there<00:00:58.150> are<00:00:58.210> two<00:00:58.360> new

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
next pack goes okay so there are two new

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.090 
next pack goes okay so there are two new
techniques<00:00:58.990> here<00:00:59.200> once<00:00:59.440> called<00:00:59.710> double

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
techniques here once called double

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.010 
techniques here once called double
stopping<00:01:00.550> which<00:01:01.150> means<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.630> playing<00:01:01.840> two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
stopping which means just playing two

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.230 
stopping which means just playing two
notes<00:01:02.050> at<00:01:02.410> once<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.610> second<00:01:06.910> technique<00:01:07.090> is

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
notes at once the second technique is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.510 
notes at once the second technique is
called<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.630> slide<00:01:07.870> which<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:14.430> keeping<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
called a slide which is keeping the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:27.240 
called a slide which is keeping the
noise<00:01:15.670> continuous<00:01:16.330> rather<00:01:17.260> than<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:27.130> we're

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
noise continuous rather than so we're

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.219 
noise continuous rather than so we're
gonna<00:01:27.340> use<00:01:27.790> our<00:01:27.970> index<00:01:28.300> finger<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.810> cover<00:01:29.020> both

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
gonna use our index finger to cover both

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.170 
gonna use our index finger to cover both
strings<00:01:29.650> it's<00:01:30.160> gonna<00:01:30.280> be<00:01:30.430> three<00:01:30.640> string

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
strings it's gonna be three string

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.109 
strings it's gonna be three string
and<00:01:31.270> each<00:01:31.630> string<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.229> third<00:01:32.500> fret<00:01:33.119> we're

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
and each string on the third fret we're

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.450 
and each string on the third fret we're
sliding<00:01:34.450> up<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.990> fifth<00:01:35.229> fret<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.130> as<00:01:36.190> soon

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
sliding up to the fifth fret so as soon

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.750 
sliding up to the fifth fret so as soon
as<00:01:36.640> we've<00:01:36.820> hit<00:01:37.030> those<00:01:37.240> two<00:01:37.479> strings

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
as we've hit those two strings

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.280 
as we've hit those two strings
we<00:01:40.270> slide<00:01:40.630> up<00:01:42.210> we've<00:01:43.210> got<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.480> be<00:01:43.570> pushing<00:01:43.870> onto

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
we slide up we've got to be pushing onto

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.730 
we slide up we've got to be pushing onto
the<00:01:44.380> neck<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.740> guitar<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.670> sound

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the neck of the guitar so that the sound

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
the neck of the guitar so that the sound
continues<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.860> come<00:01:48.010> out<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:49.750> quite<00:01:49.960> a

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
continues to come out and it's quite a

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.070 
continues to come out and it's quite a
quick<00:01:50.170> movement<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.040> should<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.990> you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
quick movement so we should get did you

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.920 
quick movement so we should get did you
fix<00:01:53.290> your<00:01:53.440> going<00:01:53.620> for<00:01:54.480> now<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.540> next<00:01:55.840> thing

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
fix your going for now the next thing

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.720 
fix your going for now the next thing
that<00:01:55.990> happens<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.650> return<00:01:57.040> to<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.520> third

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
that happens is we return to the third

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.270 
that happens is we return to the third
fret<00:01:58.030> at<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.080> same<00:01:59.290> note<00:01:59.470> again<00:01:59.740> but<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.070> not

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
fret at the same note again but it's not

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.980 
fret at the same note again but it's not
a<00:02:00.310> slide<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.850> time<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.360> can't<00:02:01.570> lift<00:02:01.780> your

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
a slide this time so you can't lift your

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.420 
a slide this time so you can't lift your
finger<00:02:02.290> you<00:02:02.530> don't<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:03.010> holding<00:02:03.220> it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
finger you don't have to be holding it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.490 
finger you don't have to be holding it
down<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.120> put<00:02:04.720> together<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.110> should<00:02:05.230> sound

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
down so put together it should sound

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
down so put together it should sound
like<00:02:05.560> this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.570 

cool<00:02:14.129> okay<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:14.580> that's<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.970> first<00:02:15.209> slide

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.670 

the<00:02:18.030> next<00:02:18.390> slide<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.900> exactly<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> same

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the next slide is exactly the same

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.590 
the next slide is exactly the same
technique<00:02:20.130> we're<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.210> use<00:02:21.330> two

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
technique we're going to use two

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.090 
technique we're going to use two
different<00:02:21.900> fingers<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.830> we're<00:02:22.980> using

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
different fingers because we're using

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.180 
different fingers because we're using
two<00:02:23.370> different<00:02:23.670> fruits<00:02:24.150> now<00:02:24.450> we're<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.890 

we've<00:02:29.190> got<00:02:29.400> our<00:02:29.580> index<00:02:29.940> finger<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> second

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we've got our index finger on the second

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
we've got our index finger on the second
fret<00:02:30.960> on<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.350> g<00:02:31.650> string<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.160> either<00:02:33.000> our

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
fret on the g string and either our

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.990 
fret on the g string and either our
third<00:02:33.600> finger<00:02:33.900> or<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.380> prefer<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:35.100> ring<00:02:35.310> finger

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.760 

prick<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> B<00:02:39.450> string<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.590> should<00:02:40.740> be

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
prick on the B string so we should be

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.710 
prick on the B string so we should be
getting<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.190> sound<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> same<00:02:42.390> thing

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
getting that sound and the same thing

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.560 
getting that sound and the same thing
sliding<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:43.290> two<00:02:43.560> frets<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.160> then<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:45.540> down

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
sliding up two frets and then back down

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.650 
sliding up two frets and then back down
again<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> slide<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:48.030> when<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.240> slide<00:02:48.510> up

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
again not a slide so when you slide up

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.200 
again not a slide so when you slide up
those<00:02:48.840> two<00:02:49.080> frets<00:02:49.550> your<00:02:50.550> index<00:02:50.880> fingers

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
those two frets your index fingers

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.670 
those two frets your index fingers
should<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.810> fourth<00:02:52.110> fret<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.620> g

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
should now be on the fourth fret on g

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.130 
should now be on the fourth fret on g
string<00:02:53.060> your<00:02:54.060> ring<00:02:54.270> finger<00:02:54.660> or<00:02:54.810> your<00:02:54.960> third

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
string your ring finger or your third

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.130 
string your ring finger or your third
finger<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.710> play<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:58.020> on

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
finger if you play like that will be on

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.370 
finger if you play like that will be on
the<00:02:58.290> fifth<00:02:58.560> fret<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.010> B<00:02:59.130> string<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
the fifth fret on B string and so the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.550 
the fifth fret on B string and so the
sound<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.710> slide<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.220> should<00:03:02.520> be<00:03:03.290> same<00:03:04.290> deal<00:03:04.530> as

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
sound of slide up should be same deal as

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
time when we come back down it's not a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.530 
time when we come back down it's not a
slide<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.760> just<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.270> into<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
slide so you just go back into that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:33.040 
slide so you just go back into that
position<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> first

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.190 

okay<00:03:33.590> say<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:35.000> then<00:03:35.210> second<00:03:35.630> slide<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:35.900> was

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
okay say and then second slide I was

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.560 
okay say and then second slide I was
using<00:03:36.410> my<00:03:36.680> ring<00:03:37.040> finger<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.880> can<00:03:38.030> also<00:03:38.240> do<00:03:38.510> it

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
using my ring finger you can also do it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:52.539 
using my ring finger you can also do it
with<00:03:38.600> your<00:03:38.720> middle<00:03:38.990> finger<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.830> do<00:03:39.950> that

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.199 

come<00:03:53.629> okay<00:03:54.659> after<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.440> slide<00:03:56.000> G<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.180> B

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
come okay after that slide G and the B

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.760 
come okay after that slide G and the B
string<00:03:58.430> play<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.909> G<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> B<00:04:00.480> strings<00:04:00.959> open

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:23.630 

so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.000 

and<00:04:24.640> all<00:04:24.790> that<00:04:24.940> happens<00:04:25.240> next<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:26.350> repeat<00:04:26.800> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
and all that happens next is a repeat of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.590 
and all that happens next is a repeat of
the<00:04:27.160> same<00:04:27.400> motion<00:04:27.850> but<00:04:30.090> we've<00:04:31.090> wait<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> little

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
the same motion but we've wait a little

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.590 
the same motion but we've wait a little
longer<00:04:31.720> at<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.170> top<00:04:32.380> here<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:34.060> when<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.420> come

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
longer at the top here and when we come

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.590 
longer at the top here and when we come
back<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.230> position<00:04:35.910> go<00:04:36.910> straight<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
back to that position go straight to the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:55.709 
back to that position go straight to the
open<00:04:37.870> position<00:04:37.900> straight<00:04:38.530> away

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.839 

so<00:04:56.439> that's<00:04:56.619> Tecton<00:04:57.159> to<00:04:57.339> the<00:04:57.429> end<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.699> what

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
so that's Tecton to the end of what

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.269 
so that's Tecton to the end of what
we've<00:04:57.999> just<00:04:58.029> played<00:04:58.499> so<00:04:59.499> put<00:04:59.709> all<00:04:59.830> together<00:04:59.949> it

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
we've just played so put all together it

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:22.039 
we've just played so put all together it
should<00:05:00.429> sound<00:05:00.639> like

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:22.049 

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:25.529 

okay<00:05:23.129> so<00:05:24.129> run<00:05:24.309> through<00:05:24.519> net<00:05:24.669> slowly<00:05:24.969> again<00:05:25.269> and

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
okay so run through net slowly again and

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.209 
okay so run through net slowly again and
do<00:05:25.719> the<00:05:25.839> slide<00:05:26.079> from<00:05:26.319> third<00:05:26.559> to<00:05:26.709> fifth<00:05:26.919> with

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
do the slide from third to fifth with

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.400 
do the slide from third to fifth with
our<00:05:27.369> index<00:05:27.610> finger

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.000 

we<00:05:30.860> do<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.190> slide<00:05:31.660> from<00:05:32.660> second<00:05:33.080> and<00:05:33.170> third<00:05:33.440> to

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
we do the slide from second and third to

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:44.320 
we do the slide from second and third to
fourth<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.430> fifth<00:05:42.640> should<00:05:43.640> note<00:05:43.850> that<00:05:43.880> when

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
fourth and fifth should note that when

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.090 
fourth and fifth should note that when
we're<00:05:44.480> playing<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:44.900> second<00:05:45.350> set<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.770> slides

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.470 

only<00:05:49.100> playing<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.490> G<00:05:49.700> and<00:05:49.940> B<00:05:50.060> strings<00:05:52.450> at<00:05:53.450> the

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
only playing the G and B strings at the

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.570 
only playing the G and B strings at the
same<00:05:53.720> time<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.440> even<00:05:55.070> when<00:05:55.160> you<00:05:55.250> get<00:05:55.370> to<00:05:55.490> the
