this smirk they gave them it's it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.260 
this smirk they gave them it's it's
perfect<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> character<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.759> Tony<00:01:29.939> Stark

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
perfect for the character of Tony Stark

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.640 
perfect for the character of Tony Stark
and<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.750> does<00:01:30.960> separate<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> from<00:01:31.470> all

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
Iron Man figures have had I think that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.590 
that I'm going to break it and of course
I<00:04:20.530> don't<00:04:21.010> want<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.400> break<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:21.910> here's<00:04:22.449> what

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
I don't want to break it so here's what

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.200 
I don't want to break it so here's what
the<00:04:22.660> battle<00:04:22.900> damage<00:04:23.139> piece<00:04:23.410> looks<00:04:23.800> like<00:04:24.210> maybe

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
the battle damage piece looks like maybe

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.510 
the battle damage piece looks like maybe
if<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.660> get<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.050> yours<00:04:26.830> pulls<00:04:27.130> off<00:04:27.310> better

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
if you get this yours pulls off better

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.390 
if you get this yours pulls off better
but<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.940> am<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.449> risking<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.979> thing<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.310> I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
but I am not risking it one thing that I

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700 
but I am not risking it one thing that I
could<00:04:30.610> get<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.940> work<00:04:31.090> though<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.599> you<00:04:32.590> could

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
could get to work though is you could

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.339 
could get to work though is you could
take<00:04:32.889> off<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.970> detachable<00:04:34.449> chest<00:04:34.840> plates<00:04:35.110> on

take off the detachable chest plates on
the<00:04:35.470> side<00:04:36.030> that's<00:04:37.030> pretty<00:04:37.300> cool<00:04:37.830> now<00:04:38.830> another

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
the side that's pretty cool now another

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.219 
the side that's pretty cool now another
neat<00:04:39.280> function<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.539> can<00:04:40.660> pull<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.930> figure

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
neat function is you can pull the figure

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.409 
neat function is you can pull the figure
up<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.440> little<00:04:41.590> bit<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.919> then<00:04:42.849> allows<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.300> to

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
up a little bit and then allows you to

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.260 
up a little bit and then allows you to
bend<00:04:43.750> him<00:04:43.930> at<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.199> waist<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.530> little<00:04:44.620> more<00:04:44.889> and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
bend him at the waist a little more and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.779 
bend him at the waist a little more and
that<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.740> really<00:04:47.740> cool<00:04:48.039> little<00:04:48.190> feature<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.610> I

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
that a really cool little feature that I

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.260 
that a really cool little feature that I
did<00:04:48.970> not<00:04:49.120> see<00:04:49.750> coming

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
did not see coming

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.640 
did not see coming
now<00:04:52.270> his<00:04:52.630> shoulder<00:04:52.990> pieces<00:04:53.820> pop<00:04:54.820> off<00:04:55.650> rather

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
now his shoulder pieces pop off rather

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.500 
now his shoulder pieces pop off rather
easily<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.250> might<00:04:57.520> add<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:59.500> can<00:04:59.530> attach

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
easily I might add and you can attach

of neutral non missile shoulder pieces

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.029 
of neutral non missile shoulder pieces
although<00:05:20.740> that's<00:05:21.099> not<00:05:21.280> nearly<00:05:21.580> as<00:05:21.729> exciting

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
although that's not nearly as exciting

as<00:06:32.010> well<00:06:32.040> I<00:06:32.490> thought<00:06:33.120> that<00:06:33.180> was<00:06:33.450> kind<00:06:33.630> of<00:06:33.720> cool

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
as well I thought that was kind of cool

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.680 
as well I thought that was kind of cool
how<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.550> shoulders<00:06:35.550> lift<00:06:35.910> up<00:06:36.060> and<00:06:36.240> down<00:06:36.300> and
