00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.370
 the leaf of the world 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.610
 and there is a house we are lost travelers 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.500
 we could spend here the night not 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.170
 I expected to find a meal and a wine 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 so good is a dream, not the house, not 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 there has been cheated on us by a raccoon what 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.150
 it seemed like a feast to us they were reality for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.150
 roll 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.230
 formerly people were very dumb 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.349
 they believed that the horns could cheat 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.360
 it's true it 's true they do test now 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.340
 they are not what they were but when a 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.769
 Raccoon is in danger spear 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.960
 some special brain waves the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.969
 the person who receives it has a mirage 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.969
 and behaves strangely 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 the scientists are experienced about 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.899
 that's not even a lumar leaf if you put it on 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 over the head throws waves 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 brain stops the please no no 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.830
 I can because it's meant for a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.900
 raccoon or something like that you should but 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.129
 We will try a dog look like the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.159
 Raccoons is not thrilled 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.530
 It only works if the animal and 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.539
 weak animals cheat to protect themselves 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.649
 but a happy dog â€‹â€‹does not have any 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.649
 need anyone 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.290
 what is always sad 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.159
 in the house next door we will never see 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.700
 to walk 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.640
 the day it 's very little food if you give it 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.509
 it can be eaten 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.509
 very much 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 i 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
 yes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.799
 and poor animal right 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:25.959
 of something I did not use shizuka but we can 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:28.860
 try it or it is not the house I say bad 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.860
 luck we have 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.379
 approaching him he did not see anyone and from 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.379
 look for her in care 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.750
 then also employee 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.130
 but what is this we have changed from 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.930
 body as it could have happened 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.680
 being nothing 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.680
 how 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.820
 this closes again 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.810
 of wonders and freedom 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.810
 hatred 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.810
 like he does not return the ball to us if not 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.680
 play with us what he says seriously is 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.850
 the ruffian does not remove all this 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.850
 can not see me 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.590
 you have made another career 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.700
 but it is very fast 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.150
 - to earn you I promise 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 plus 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.480
 I guess this is the way it has 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.150
 come to take revenge on me I've treated him very 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.710
 wrong and now what worries me in if I 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.710
 I'll stay like that for the rest of my life 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.070
 all things will be different 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.180
 Y 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.039
 now that he has had a good day 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.229
 how do you think he will react when he returns 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.229
 to normality we'll see 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.180
 look he is also confused 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.349

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.460

 where will he have gotten 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.229
 Y 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.750
