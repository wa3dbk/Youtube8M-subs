we have the hold vent right here there's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.720 
we have the hold vent right here there's
a<00:02:18.480> tiny<00:02:18.720> event<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.860> dropped<00:02:20.220> because

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
a tiny event that I just dropped because

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.930 
a tiny event that I just dropped because
I'm<00:02:21.030> stupid<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:22.620> little<00:02:22.950> tiny<00:02:23.099> hold<00:02:23.370> vent<00:02:23.610> you

have the hold vent attached to the brain
the<00:02:27.209> hold<00:02:27.450> event<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.810> called<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> bio<00:02:28.379> winder

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the hold event is called the bio winder

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.680 
the hold event is called the bio winder
by<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.129> way<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.459> part<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:30.150> always<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.420> fun

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
by the way this part that's always a fun

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.089 
by the way this part that's always a fun
fun<00:02:31.680> fact<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> nice<00:02:33.890> poseable<00:02:34.890> wire

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
fun fact so this is a nice poseable wire

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.000 
fun fact so this is a nice poseable wire
so<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.640> get<00:02:35.760> whatever<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.630> on

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
so you can get whatever you want to on

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.800 
so you can get whatever you want to on
that<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.880> get<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.920> tip<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.459> bio<00:02:42.120> visor<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
that you get a tip of the bio visor that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.080 
that you get a tip of the bio visor that
is<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> bendable<00:02:43.769> wire<00:02:43.799> too<00:02:44.280> because

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
is on a bendable wire too because

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.520 
is on a bendable wire too because
basically<00:02:45.330> what<00:02:45.660> happens<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
basically what happens is that this

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.440 
basically what happens is that this
piece<00:02:46.769> comes<00:02:47.099> off<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.910> piece<00:02:51.150> goes

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
piece comes off and then this piece goes

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.580 
piece comes off and then this piece goes
in<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.489> basically<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.690> when<00:02:55.410> he

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
in and basically it is for when he

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.740 
in and basically it is for when he
extends<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.579> insert<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> card<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
extends it insert the card and then it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.380 
extends it insert the card and then it
goes<00:02:58.099> kind<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> chameleon<00:02:59.730> or<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.090> toad

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
goes kind of like a chameleon or a toad

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
goes kind of like a chameleon or a toad
eating<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.959> fly<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.579> whole

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730

eating a fly so that was the whole
gimmick<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.470> that's<00:03:04.620> always<00:03:04.860> fun

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
gimmick on that so that's always fun

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.979 
gimmick on that so that's always fun
just<00:03:06.390> slide<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:06.840> piece<00:03:07.049> back<00:03:07.349> in<00:03:07.730> five

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
I saw no viable difference between the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.289 
I saw no viable difference between the
one<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> belt<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.970> only

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
one in the belt and this one the only

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.080 
one in the belt and this one the only
difference<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.780> could<00:03:33.959> spot<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.790> gold

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
difference I could spot is that the gold

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.030 
difference I could spot is that the gold
trim<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> card<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.500> one<00:03:37.709> while

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
trim of the card is on this one while

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.610 
trim of the card is on this one while
this<00:03:38.160> one<00:03:38.370> is<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.700> blue<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.540> don't<00:03:40.109> know<00:03:40.530> if

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
thought it was gonna be a one that was

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.819 
thought it was gonna be a one that was
broken<00:03:48.109> but<00:03:49.109> they<00:03:49.260> never<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:49.650> did<00:03:49.769> that

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
broken but they never really did that

with any of the other riders but I don't
really<00:03:53.700> know<00:03:53.910> why<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.420> included<00:03:54.859> but<00:03:55.859> it's

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340

have little holes in here and so
basically<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.970> take<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.239> wire<00:04:12.980> plug<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.130> into

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
basically you take the wire plug it into

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.629 
basically you take the wire plug it into
that<00:04:14.370> hand<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.510> now<00:04:15.630> he's<00:04:15.780> holding<00:04:16.139> the

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
that hand and so now he's holding the

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.750 
that hand and so now he's holding the
the<00:04:17.639> Bayeux<00:04:17.880> winder<00:04:18.500> like<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.250> i<00:04:20.609> guess

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
the Bayeux winder like that and i guess

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.260 
the Bayeux winder like that and i guess
you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.000> also<00:04:21.150> do<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.840> for<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:22.950> one

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
you can also do it for the for this one

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.219 
you can also do it for the for this one
even<00:04:24.270> though<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.479> doesn't<00:04:24.780> make<00:04:24.870> too<00:04:25.080> much

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
even though that doesn't make too much

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.270 
even though that doesn't make too much
sense<00:04:25.289> but<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.190> can<00:04:26.340> pretend

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
sense but you can pretend

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.540 
sense but you can pretend
so<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.060> got<00:04:28.240> two<00:04:28.510> hands<00:04:29.080> for<00:04:29.410> those<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.010> like

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
so you got two hands for those and like

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.280 
so you got two hands for those and like
I<00:04:30.580> said<00:04:30.700> just<00:04:31.000> various<00:04:31.300> other<00:04:31.510> holding<00:04:31.960> hands

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
I said just various other holding hands

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.620 
I said just various other holding hands
this<00:04:32.920> one<00:04:33.100> has<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> little<00:04:33.460> peg<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.090> for<00:04:34.540> if

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
this one has a little peg in it for if

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.960 
this one has a little peg in it for if
you're<00:04:34.750> holding<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.230> Bayeux<00:04:35.440> winder<00:04:36.010> without
