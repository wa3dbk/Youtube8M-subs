also use the new me white truffle hair

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.750 
also use the new me white truffle hair
mask<00:01:28.990> which<00:01:29.200> makes<00:01:29.500> my<00:01:29.680> hair<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.190> soft<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
mask which makes my hair so soft and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.580 
mask which makes my hair so soft and
shiny<00:01:30.820> as<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.330> could<00:01:31.510> see<00:01:31.540> right<00:01:31.690> here<00:01:32.110> but

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
shiny as you could see right here but

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.680 
shiny as you could see right here but
it's<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.890> little<00:01:33.160> too<00:01:33.340> silky<00:01:33.940> for<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.390> hold<00:01:34.540> a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
it's a little too silky for it to hold a

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.330 
it's a little too silky for it to hold a
curl<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:35.110> i'm<00:01:35.229> spraying<00:01:35.500> some<00:01:35.770> dry<00:01:35.950> shampoo

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
curl so i'm spraying some dry shampoo

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340 
curl so i'm spraying some dry shampoo
into<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:36.970> i<00:01:37.300> actually<00:01:37.479> do<00:01:37.900> this<00:01:38.020> every

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
into it and i actually do this every

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.290 
into it and i actually do this every
time<00:01:38.500> before<00:01:38.710> i<00:01:38.950> curl<00:01:39.220> my<00:01:39.250> hair<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:40.119> add

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
time before i curl my hair I don't add

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.749 
time before i curl my hair I don't add
any<00:01:40.540> hairspray<00:01:40.930> at<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.290> end<00:01:41.500> i<00:01:41.800> find<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.460> dry

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
any hairspray at the end i find that dry

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.490 
any hairspray at the end i find that dry
shampoo<00:01:43.119> really<00:01:43.420> helps<00:01:43.720> hold<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.080> curl<00:01:44.290> much

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
shampoo really helps hold the curl much

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.469 
shampoo really helps hold the curl much
longer<00:01:44.920> than<00:01:45.070> hairspray<00:01:45.460> does<00:01:45.670> now<00:01:46.180> i'm<00:01:46.330> going

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
longer than hairspray does now i'm going
