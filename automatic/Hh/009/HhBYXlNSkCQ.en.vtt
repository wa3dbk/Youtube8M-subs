00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.760

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.809

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.820
 Especially strongly spread about this 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.689

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.770
 so inside everything was beautiful 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.140
 such a light historical novel without 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.930
 any claims and even wanted 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.299

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 enjoyable and relaxing today 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 the task is to find 5 items from the book 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.020
 I decided not to read the framework of the marathon 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.140
 move away from the ticket office and select the abbey 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.270
