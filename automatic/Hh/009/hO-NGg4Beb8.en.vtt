00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.389
 June 14, 2014 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.480
 Parisians and Parisians welcome 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 launched this 11th edition has allowed our 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
 citizens to get to know the job better 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.090
 of military last years this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.460
 operation is a great success it's a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 good initiative and that's fine me 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 I find because it allows to be in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.939
 contact - a little bit with 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.050
 military and then they were asked 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.759
 a few questions then I believe that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 for children too that allows them to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.940
 discover trades 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.200
 the military make it so 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.090
 friendly to Parisians their 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.180
 know-how their know-how and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 thus testify to their commitment 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.289
 small vehicle protected armored vehicles 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 light vehicles high mobility tanks 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370
 leclerc and Caesar or rave and adults 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.219
 as the youngest ones frankly it's 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.820
 well present and that's enough 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.840
 impressive for some materials 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 a lot of new discoveries 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 technologies after pretty impressive 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.450
 how did they get a post made? 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.650
 move here in Paris from the taste of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.380
 fields-elysed so far in the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 little streets it was pretty funny to see 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 what they were able to do with 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.159
 the leclerc tank to pass to two 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.080
 centimeters of a car 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.180
 one afternoon our soldiers found in the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 look at their fellow citizens admiration 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170
 of their weapons and thereby strengthening the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 link army nation 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 i find that army link nation like 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 you say it is super important 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.970
 especially during the national holiday that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.170
 allows to gather other people 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 whether it is civilians 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240
 military people or people 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.829
 other backgrounds and especially with them 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.720
 the emission rp as we do this after 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.850
 noon which are completely apart from the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.189
 parade of July 14 allows to have a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.890
 situation close to people who 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.360
 are around the 15th arrondissement 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.810
 see you next year for the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.810
