about<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> take<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.550> try<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about as you take off I really try to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.959

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
breathe because I sometimes forget to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:01.010 
breathe because I sometimes forget to
breathe<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> gun<00:01:00.660> goes<00:01:00.870> off

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.689 
breathe and then I go the gun goes off
and<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.119 
and you
stand<00:01:03.629> over<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.929> water<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> don't<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:04.979> hear

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
stand over the water I don't really hear

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
stand over the water I don't really hear
much<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.780> try<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
much and see very little I just try to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
much and see very little I just try to
feel<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.740> same<00:01:08.040> emotions<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.790> I've<00:01:09.030> been

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
feel those same emotions that I've been

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.380 
feel those same emotions that I've been
doing<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.689> mind<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.740> run<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
doing my mind the run is actually the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.080 
doing my mind the run is actually the
most<00:01:12.570> important<00:01:13.020> part<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> jump<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.880> then

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
most important part of the jump and then

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.249 
most important part of the jump and then
you<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.299> can't<00:01:15.479> think<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.899> you<00:01:16.020> stepped

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you just can't think then you stepped

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
you just can't think then you stepped
away<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> four<00:01:17.399> it's<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.030> fast

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
away it's over in four it's very fast

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
away it's over in four it's very fast

lure<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> sense<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.679> speed<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
lure that sense of speed it's one of the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.340 
lure that sense of speed it's one of the
greatest<00:01:36.030> things<00:01:36.210> ever<00:01:36.330> feel<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.899> free<00:01:37.140> fall

greatest things ever feel that free fall
at<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.530> end<00:01:37.649> it's<00:01:37.770> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.190> little<00:01:38.250> reward

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
at the end it's kind of a little reward

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.570 
at the end it's kind of a little reward
first<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.229> got<00:01:40.409> strapped<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.039> belt<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
first I got strapped into a belt and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.700 
first I got strapped into a belt and
then<00:01:41.759> eventually<00:01:42.299> my<00:01:42.630> code<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.140> spot<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
then eventually my code to just spot and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.320 
then eventually my code to just spot and
then<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.069> just<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.369> by<00:01:44.670> myself<00:01:44.850> just

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
then I would just go by myself just

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.100 
then I would just go by myself just
blues<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.229> what's<00:01:46.440> going<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.840> try<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> not

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
blues with what's going on I try to not

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.050 
blues with what's going on I try to not
think<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.619> too<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:50.970> your

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
think about too much kind of take your

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.910 
think about too much kind of take your
brain<00:01:51.299> out<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> let<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.409> let<00:01:52.799> your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
brain out of it and let your let your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.529 
brain out of it and let your let your
body<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.429> work<00:01:53.459> it's<00:01:53.819> kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.209> years

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
body do the work it's kind of like years

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.270 
body do the work it's kind of like years
and<00:01:54.780> years<00:01:54.959> thousands<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> jumps<00:01:55.799> update<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and years thousands of jumps update and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.279 
and years thousands of jumps update and
every<00:01:56.670> year<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.060> add<00:01:57.209> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.750> foot<00:01:58.080> maybe

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
every year you add you know a foot maybe

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.790 
every year you add you know a foot maybe
a<00:01:58.440> few<00:01:58.649> inches

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.450 

it's<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.890> mental<00:02:05.160> rush<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:06.950> try<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.010> think<00:02:08.310> about

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's a mental rush I try to think about

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's a mental rush I try to think about
some<00:02:08.910> things<00:02:09.150> that<00:02:09.420> I've<00:02:09.630> picked<00:02:09.930> out<00:02:10.050> before

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
some things that I've picked out before

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.260 
some things that I've picked out before
the<00:02:10.530> race<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:10.950> focus<00:02:11.490> on<00:02:11.640> yeah<00:02:12.030> where<00:02:12.180> they

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the race to focus on yeah where they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.150 
the race to focus on yeah where they
have<00:02:12.390> time<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.720> stop<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.080> analyze<00:02:13.590> any

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
have time to stop and analyze any

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.770 
have time to stop and analyze any
individual<00:02:14.760> play<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.570> left

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
individual play if you do get left

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.110 
individual play if you do get left
behind<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.860> try<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.070> focus<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.610> surviving

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
behind I just try to focus on surviving

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.870 
behind I just try to focus on surviving
my<00:02:18.240> last<00:02:18.480> tumbling<00:02:18.930> pass<00:02:19.490> one<00:02:20.490> thing<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.760> me

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
my last tumbling pass one thing for me

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.640 
my last tumbling pass one thing for me
would<00:02:21.000> always<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.630> attack<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> wall<00:02:22.560> as

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
would always be to attack the wall as

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.820 
would always be to attack the wall as
much<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:23.010> possible<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:25.080> took<00:02:25.290> me<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> whole<00:02:25.590> year

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
much as possible it took me a whole year

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.520 
much as possible it took me a whole year
to<00:02:26.490> learn<00:02:26.670> my<00:02:26.850> release<00:02:27.150> move<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.140> probably

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to learn my release move it was probably

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.290 
to learn my release move it was probably
just<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> millions<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.610> millions<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.030> turns

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
just the millions and millions of turns

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.210 
just the millions and millions of turns
that<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.570> took<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.870> eventually<00:02:31.380> went<00:02:31.800> click

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
that I took that eventually went click

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.590 
that I took that eventually went click
the<00:02:32.460> end<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> race<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.060> always<00:02:33.240> very

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the end of the race is always very

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.970 
the end of the race is always very
painful<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.740> dig

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
painful but you just kind of have to dig

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.100 
painful but you just kind of have to dig
deep<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.370> push<00:02:35.760> through<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:36.300> nothing<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
deep and push through there nothing I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
deep and push through there nothing I
can't<00:02:37.410> believe<00:02:37.980> at<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> same<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.850> me

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
can't believe at the same time for me

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:57.340 
can't believe at the same time for me
it's<00:02:39.390> definitely<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.870> true

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.410
