around follow-through across your body a
little<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:15.870> than<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.290> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
little bit more than you would it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.330 
little bit more than you would it's
almost<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.370> windscreen<00:01:17.820> wiper<00:01:19.159> motion<00:01:20.159> as

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
almost like a windscreen wiper motion as

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.770 
almost like a windscreen wiper motion as
opposed<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> threw<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> you're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
opposed to more of a threw that you're

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
opposed to more of a threw that you're
you're<00:01:22.170> hit<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.620> driving<00:01:23.010> poor<00:01:23.370> hand<00:01:23.580> deep

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you're hit for a driving poor hand deep

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
you're hit for a driving poor hand deep
this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.050> hopefully<00:01:25.200> dipping

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this is going to be hopefully dipping

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670 
this is going to be hopefully dipping
down<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:26.940> of<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.120> rainbow<00:01:27.479> effect<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
down it's more of a rainbow effect and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
down it's more of a rainbow effect and
so<00:01:28.860> therefore<00:01:29.070> you've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.580> snap<00:01:29.880> over

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
so therefore you've got to snap over

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.399 
so therefore you've got to snap over
more<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> wrist<00:01:30.840> bit<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.320> more

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
more with the wrist bit a little more

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.640 
more with the wrist bit a little more
relaxed<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.610> under<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.940> ball<00:01:33.090> snap<00:01:33.870> over<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
relaxed get under the ball snap over and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.050 
relaxed get under the ball snap over and
let<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> spin<00:01:35.370> bring<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> down

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
let the spin bring it down

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
let the spin bring it down
don't<00:01:36.210> rely<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.479> gravity<00:01:36.780> okay<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
don't rely on gravity okay because this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.320 
don't rely on gravity okay because this
ball<00:01:37.950> needs<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.190> get<00:01:38.430> quickly<00:01:38.700> over<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> top

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
ball needs to get quickly over the top

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.210 
ball needs to get quickly over the top
of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.510> net<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:39.900> drop<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.620> before<00:01:40.979> he<00:01:41.070> goes

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
of the net and drop in before he goes
