How'd the early shift go?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.630
Terrible.

Why? What happened?

Well, Jackie took Brandon's shoes during nap time,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.000 position:73%
and he hid them somewhere and he can't remember

They were buried in the tub with the Legos.

What's with the color labels?

I was thinking, the kids have labels in all their clothing,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.380 position:81%

Yeah.
