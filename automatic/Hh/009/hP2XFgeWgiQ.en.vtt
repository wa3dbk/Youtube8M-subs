00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.879
 moin moin and welcome to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.300
 delete another sequence of taxi 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.120
 Today it's about the comparison of the apple 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.710
 care protection plan with the gravis 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.710
 Hardware protection and hardware protection 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 I have you already a short time ago 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.200
 the hardware protection and within the 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.810
 protection pro of gravis in detail 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.300
 presented to some of you that was 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.340
 too detailed I have the criticism 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.880
 accepted and will with this video 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.309
 make a short contribution to the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.200
 compare applecare protection plan 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.840
 with hardware protection and hardware 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.330
 protection of gravis let's start with the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.920
 applecare protection plan what is that 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.309
 is actually only one 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.309
 warranty extension with support at mc 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.650
 devices is a mac and so on 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.640
 the warranty extension at 36 months 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:10.640
 speaks three years including the phone 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.500
 support from apple on 0 866 45 45 1 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 the applecare protection plan includes 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.440
 also a service worldwide where here 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.960
 walk into any Apple store can order their 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880
 to deliver and repair defective devices 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.620
 allow 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 Of course there is the atp like 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.420
 to short the applecare protection plan 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.880
 also referred to as ios devices is there 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.880
 the warranty extension to only 24 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 Months including there by phone 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 and support and worldwide service there 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.260
 is there a special that is the ubs 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.690
 pick up service which apple quite 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.880
 occasionally offers that is but 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.970
 apparently negotiable thing goes 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.730
 but relatively quickly we come to the gravis 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.260
 Hardware protection is similar to the ap a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.800
 pure warranty extension with 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.510
 telephone support, however 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.030
 costs the support at there was anyway 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.750
 still applies here is a distinction 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.209
 between the max and ios devices 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.450
 the macs also the guarantee on 36 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.610
 months at aggressive it is on 24 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.069
 months and last but not least we would have 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.269
 the gravis hardware protection pro of these 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.489
 also includes the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.879
 warranty extension for macs 36+ 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.250
 months ios device on 24 months but 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.010
 now comes the big advantage to me 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.340
 personally it is the so-called 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.380
 Cascade damage with mc devices is with 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.290
 one yourself 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.650
 536 for macbooks eg and macbook pro and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.690
 macbook air is and so on 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.110
 that is, when you drop your device 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.060
 lets or else something happens to you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.940
 and that is relatively self-inflicted 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.700
 by clumsiness then you can 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.520
 for the self forest of 536 in the trap 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.210
 a total damage a new device 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.760
 to get 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.710
 it is similar to the ios devices 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.870
 example I had that in the last 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.010
 Video where the protection against 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.590
 addressed 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.810
 you are allowed your iphone fall twice 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.780
 leave and then gets twice 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.060
 new for the deductible of 49 euro 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 after the second time, though 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.740
 conclusion so that would be the hardware 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.600
 delete protection 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.480
 I hope with this short explanation 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.660
 you the explicit differences 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.340
 between applecare protection plan 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.709
 hardware protection and skin protection pro by 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.020
 to have brought gravis closer 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.120
 if you like this video better 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.269
 has as the last to the topic of hardware 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.130
 protection then thumbs up and 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.940
 of course, write your opinion in the 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.760
 Comments 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.200
 until then and until recently, keep on 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.200
 rocking new thing
