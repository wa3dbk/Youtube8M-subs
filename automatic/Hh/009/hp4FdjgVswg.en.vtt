00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
teleporter room and so the way these

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
teleporter room and so the way these
work<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.859> way<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> ruins<00:00:32.279> work<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.700> game

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
work the way the ruins work in this game

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.150 
work the way the ruins work in this game
is<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.260> draw<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> shape<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.040> on

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is that you you draw the shape out on

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.260 
is that you you draw the shape out on
the<00:00:35.250> ground<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:35.899> even<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> wall<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:39.120> draw

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the ground or even on a wall you draw

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
the ground or even on a wall you draw
the<00:00:39.329> shape<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:40.140> box<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the shape out with box and then you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.840 
the shape out with box and then you
activate<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.890> setting<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
activate it and so here I'm setting up a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
activate it and so here I'm setting up a
like<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.809> said<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.050> teleporter<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.710> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
like I said the teleporter so this is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.650 
like I said the teleporter so this is
the<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> teleporter<00:00:48.030> portion<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the this is the teleporter portion and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750 
the this is the teleporter portion and
then<00:00:49.440> after<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.100> finished<00:00:50.399> we'll<00:00:50.640> move

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
then after this is finished we'll move

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.650 
then after this is finished we'll move
on<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.660> Waypoint<00:00:52.620> portion<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.510> what

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
on to the Waypoint portion and so what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
on to the Waypoint portion and so what
I'm<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> set<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:57.350> what's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I'm going to do here is set the what's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
I'm going to do here is set the what's
it<00:00:58.440> called<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.920> key<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.449> have

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it called the key so you actually have

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160 
it called the key so you actually have
multiple<00:01:01.050> teleporters<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> server<00:01:03.110> how<00:01:04.110> do

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
multiple teleporters on a server how do

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.280 
multiple teleporters on a server how do
I<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.720> do<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:08.930> haven't<00:01:09.930> done

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

any other so I have one other two goes
to<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.040> mind<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.460> set<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:15.229> alright<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to a mind that I have set up alright so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.859 
to a mind that I have set up alright so
I<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> basic<00:01:17.490> layout<00:01:17.729> set<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.659> there's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I have the basic layout set so there's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.530 
I have the basic layout set so there's
the<00:01:19.049> key<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> dollar<00:01:21.180> symbol

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the key it's kind of the dollar symbol

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.499 
the key it's kind of the dollar symbol
so<00:01:21.869> we'll<00:01:22.020> activate<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.930> teleporter<00:01:24.930> accepted

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
so we'll activate it teleporter accepted

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
so we'll activate it teleporter accepted
such<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> destination<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.590> been<00:01:28.799> opened

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
such a destination has not been opened

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.030 
such a destination has not been opened
ok<00:01:29.430> cool<00:01:30.140> that's<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.259> telling<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
ok cool that's just telling me that the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240 
ok cool that's just telling me that the
other<00:01:32.070> side<00:01:32.640> hasn't<00:01:32.850> been<00:01:33.090> built<00:01:33.270> yet<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> I'd

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
other side hasn't been built yet so I'd

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
other side hasn't been built yet so I'd
it<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> yep<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:37.110> logs<00:01:37.350> into<00:01:37.619> planks<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.140> just

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it is a yep two logs into planks so just

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.109 
it is a yep two logs into planks so just
as<00:01:40.290> an<00:01:40.829> example<00:01:40.920> I'll<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.000> do

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
as an example I'll come over here and do

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.280 
as an example I'll come over here and do
the<00:01:42.240> other<00:01:42.420> side<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.750> I'll<00:01:45.960> draw<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the other side and so I'll draw the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.710 
the other side and so I'll draw the
shape<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.570> bit

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
shape for this one and it's a little bit

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.140 
shape for this one and it's a little bit
different<00:01:49.200> shape<00:01:51.079> just<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.060 

and<00:01:58.150> we'll<00:01:58.360> block<00:01:58.570> in<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.840> middle<00:02:01.890> buck<00:02:02.890> right

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
and we'll block in the middle buck right

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.770 
and we'll block in the middle buck right
there<00:02:03.100> block<00:02:03.490> right<00:02:03.700> there<00:02:03.760> right<00:02:04.330> there<00:02:04.510> all

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
there block right there right there all

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.770 
there block right there right there all
right<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:06.130> we<00:02:06.340> want<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.730> same<00:02:07.060> pattern

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
right and then we want the same pattern

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.140 
right and then we want the same pattern
so<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.730> like<00:02:09.730> that<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.630> like<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:12.850> if<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.000> did

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so a like that and like that so if I did

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.260 
so a like that and like that so if I did

opening<00:02:16.510> has<00:02:16.780> been<00:02:16.960> created<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> fabric

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
opening has been created in the fabric

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.850 
opening has been created in the fabric
of<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> ether<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.930> Waypoint<00:02:20.410> signature<00:02:20.800> is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
of the ether the Waypoint signature is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.950 
of the ether the Waypoint signature is
no<00:02:20.980> longer<00:02:21.220> needed<00:02:21.460> here<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.850> think<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.810> can

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
no longer needed here I think you can

no longer needed here I think you can
take<00:02:23.170> down<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.650> weight<00:02:23.860> point<00:02:24.100> once<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.490> have

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
take down the weight point once you have

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.540 
take down the weight point once you have
it<00:02:24.760> set<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:25.300> not<00:02:25.510> sure<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.800> let's<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.460> this
