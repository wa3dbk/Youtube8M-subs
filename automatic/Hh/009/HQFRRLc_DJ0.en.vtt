favorite is the arpeggio this purple one
right<00:00:49.220> here<00:00:49.610> so<00:00:50.089> we're<00:00:50.210> gonna<00:00:50.330> pull<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.659> one

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
right here so we're gonna pull that one

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.049 
right here so we're gonna pull that one
out<00:00:50.900> all<00:00:51.589> of<00:00:51.830> our<00:00:51.949> machines<00:00:52.100> have<00:00:52.519> internal

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
out all of our machines have internal

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.640 
out all of our machines have internal
thermostats<00:00:53.689> that<00:00:53.839> keep<00:00:54.080> the<00:00:54.199> temperature

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
thermostats that keep the temperature

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.729 
thermostats that keep the temperature
between<00:00:54.970> 186<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.119> 196<00:00:56.809> degrees<00:00:57.290> Fahrenheit

between 186 and 196 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.710 
between 186 and 196 degrees Fahrenheit
this<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.489> enough<00:00:58.729> heat<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.150> brew<00:00:59.330> our<00:00:59.479> coffee

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
this is enough heat to brew our coffee

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.359 
this is enough heat to brew our coffee
but<00:01:00.019> not<00:01:00.140> enough<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.439> burn<00:01:00.619> our<00:01:00.830> beans<00:01:01.040> and

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
but not enough to burn our beans and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.710 
but not enough to burn our beans and
give<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.580> that<00:01:01.699> acidic<00:01:02.119> taste<00:01:02.330> that<00:01:02.479> turns

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
give it that acidic taste that turns

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.869 
give it that acidic taste that turns
people<00:01:02.809> away<00:01:03.170> from<00:01:03.229> coffee<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:04.549> order<00:01:04.759> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
people away from coffee but in order to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.039 
people away from coffee but in order to
steam<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.239> milk<00:01:05.420> with<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.689> automatic

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
steam the milk with the automatic

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.390 
steam the milk with the automatic
frother<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:06.770> i<00:01:06.890> think<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.189> coolest

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
frother which i think is the coolest

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.249 
frother which i think is the coolest
function<00:01:07.909> of<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.090> whole<00:01:08.210> machine<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:08.780> need<00:01:09.170> to

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
function of the whole machine I need to

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.200 
function of the whole machine I need to
raise<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.650> temperature<00:01:10.009> up<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.220> 212<00:01:10.850> degrees

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
raise the temperature up to 212 degrees

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.120 
raise the temperature up to 212 degrees
so<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:11.810> do<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.140> simply<00:01:12.439> by<00:01:12.470> pressing<00:01:12.830> this

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
so I do that simply by pressing this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.160 
so I do that simply by pressing this
button<00:01:13.189> right<00:01:13.520> here<00:01:13.880> when<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.390> do<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:14.840> this

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
button right here when I do that this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.780 
button right here when I do that this
light<00:01:15.409> starts<00:01:15.710> flashing<00:01:15.799> it's<00:01:16.490> easy<00:01:16.640> to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
light starts flashing it's easy to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.149 
light starts flashing it's easy to
remember<00:01:17.450> when<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.409> blinking<00:01:18.890> it's

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
remember when it's blinking it's

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.859 
remember when it's blinking it's
thinking<00:01:19.640> when<00:01:19.939> it's<00:01:20.090> steady<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:20.630> ready

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
thinking when it's steady it's ready

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.050 
thinking when it's steady it's ready
when<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.620> press<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:21.920> button<00:01:22.159> it<00:01:22.610> turned<00:01:22.880> my

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
when I press that button it turned my

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.090 
when I press that button it turned my
pour<00:01:23.420> buttons<00:01:23.840> off<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:24.560> at<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:24.830> temperature

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
pour buttons off so at this temperature

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.800 
pour buttons off so at this temperature
the<00:01:25.310> machine<00:01:25.610> will<00:01:25.790> not<00:01:26.000> let<00:01:26.210> me<00:01:26.360> brew<00:01:26.540> coffee

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
the machine will not let me brew coffee

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.080 
the machine will not let me brew coffee
it's<00:01:27.140> too<00:01:27.320> hot<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.070> would<00:01:28.190> burn<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.580> beans<00:01:28.760> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
it's too hot it would burn the beans the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
it's too hot it would burn the beans the
machine<00:01:29.390> will<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.690> let<00:01:29.870> me<00:01:29.960> make<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> bad<00:01:30.350> cup

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
machine will not let me make a bad cup

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.649 
machine will not let me make a bad cup
of<00:01:30.710> coffee<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.580> takes<00:01:31.730> about<00:01:31.850> 20<00:01:32.180> seconds<00:01:32.479> for

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
of coffee it takes about 20 seconds for

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.480 
of coffee it takes about 20 seconds for
the<00:01:32.720> machine<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.050> heat<00:01:33.290> up<00:01:33.340> while<00:01:34.340> we're

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the machine to heat up while we're

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.469 
the machine to heat up while we're
waiting<00:01:34.729> for<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:35.030> I'm<00:01:35.120> going<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.270> talk<00:01:35.450> about

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
waiting for it I'm going to talk about

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.090 
waiting for it I'm going to talk about
the<00:01:35.720> automatic<00:01:36.050> frother<00:01:36.440> which<00:01:36.710> i<00:01:36.800> think<00:01:36.860> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the automatic frother which i think is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.980 
the automatic frother which i think is
the<00:01:37.220> coolest<00:01:37.340> function<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.510> gonna<00:01:38.659> do<00:01:38.840> is
