00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
with a helicopter here actually I worked

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.280 
with a helicopter here actually I worked
as<00:00:37.640> electrician<00:00:38.240> I<00:00:38.390> worked<00:00:38.570> as<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.780> grip<00:00:39.110> i

as electrician I worked as a grip i

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.070 
as electrician I worked as a grip i
worked<00:00:39.470> as<00:00:39.650> actually<00:00:40.130> a<00:00:40.190> DP<00:00:40.580> on<00:00:40.730> low-budget

shows<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:43.120> even<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.270> gaffer<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.840> i<00:00:46.330> think<00:00:47.330> this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
shows and even a gaffer and i think this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.360 
shows and even a gaffer and i think this
is<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.690> natural<00:00:50.200> step<00:00:51.200> for<00:00:51.230> me<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.040> go<00:00:52.190> into

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
is the natural step for me to go into

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.940 
is the natural step for me to go into
this<00:00:52.640> what's<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.720> name<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:53.900> this<00:00:54.080> helicopter

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
this what's the name of this helicopter

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.610 
this what's the name of this helicopter
I<00:00:55.310> say<00:00:55.550> hexacopter<00:00:56.080> basically<00:00:57.080> based<00:00:57.290> on<00:00:57.500> the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
I say hexacopter basically based on the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.250 
I say hexacopter basically based on the
number<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.280> blades<00:00:58.520> here<00:00:58.820> which<00:00:58.970> are<00:00:59.090> six<00:00:59.360> now

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
number of blades here which are six now

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.500 
number of blades here which are six now

well<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.710> just<00:01:21.800> noticed<00:01:22.460> two<00:01:22.670> weeks<00:01:22.880> ago<00:01:23.090> on

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
well I just noticed two weeks ago on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.990 
well I just noticed two weeks ago on
ABC's<00:01:23.960> premiere<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.160> river<00:01:25.810> they<00:01:26.810> had<00:01:27.500> was

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
ABC's premiere of the river they had was

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.910 
ABC's premiere of the river they had was
yeah<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.659> was<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> character<00:01:30.140> actually<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.830> was

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
yeah it was a character actually it was

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920 
yeah it was a character actually it was
a<00:01:31.010> character<00:01:31.250> in<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.580> movie<00:01:31.730> I<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.420> hope

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
a character in the movie I think I hope

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.380 
a character in the movie I think I hope
they<00:01:33.110> keep<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.470> in<00:01:33.650> but<00:01:34.430> uh<00:01:34.460> I'm<00:01:34.909> just<00:01:35.120> think<00:01:35.360> of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
they keep it in but uh I'm just think of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.060 
they keep it in but uh I'm just think of
the<00:01:35.480> second<00:01:35.810> episode<00:01:35.870> they<00:01:36.200> crashed<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.740> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the second episode they crashed it and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.970 
the second episode they crashed it and
they<00:01:37.400> also<00:01:37.550> killed<00:01:37.970> off<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.420> pilot<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.320> that

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
they also killed off the pilot so that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
they also killed off the pilot so that
wasn't<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.340> good<00:01:40.460> idea<00:01:41.050> yeah<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.350> matter<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.740> fact

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
wasn't a good idea yeah a matter of fact

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.170 
wasn't a good idea yeah a matter of fact
most<00:01:44.000> recently<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.840> another<00:01:46.180> multi-rotor

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
most recently to another multi-rotor

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.010 
most recently to another multi-rotor
helicopter<00:01:47.300> was<00:01:48.050> featured<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:50.510> guess

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
helicopter was featured in the I guess

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.070 
helicopter was featured in the I guess
another<00:01:51.350> ABC<00:01:51.620> showed<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:53.030> modern<00:01:53.420> family<00:01:53.900> and

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
another ABC showed the modern family and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.670 
another ABC showed the modern family and
so<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:56.450> think<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.049> is<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.440> be<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
so I I think this is going to be the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.550 
so I I think this is going to be the
year<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.450> multi<00:01:59.450> rotor<00:01:59.630> lilybell<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.260> think

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
year of the multi rotor lilybell I think

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.810 
year of the multi rotor lilybell I think
so<00:02:00.740> like<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.040> said<00:02:01.130> there's<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.400> lot<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.670> them

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
so like I said there's a lot of them

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.370 
so like I said there's a lot of them
coming<00:02:02.150> out<00:02:02.240> these<00:02:02.479> days<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.990> they're<00:02:03.350> very

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
coming out these days and they're very

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.219 
coming out these days and they're very
easy<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.190> fly<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.909> very<00:02:05.540> easy<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> learn<00:02:06.049> how

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
easy to fly and very easy to learn how

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.940 
easy to fly and very easy to learn how
to<00:02:06.350> fly<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.799> understand<00:02:07.250> them

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to fly I understand them

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
seems like a growing controversy now

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.120 
seems like a growing controversy now
that<00:03:12.630> there's<00:03:13.630> been<00:03:13.870> some<00:03:14.079> news<00:03:14.319> pieces<00:03:14.859> where

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
that there's been some news pieces where

that there's been some news pieces where
they're<00:03:15.280> telling<00:03:15.670> us<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.900> be

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
they're telling us that it's going to be

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.910 
they're telling us that it's going to be
three<00:03:17.410> years<00:03:17.889> before<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.579> FCC<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:20.530> actually

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
three years before the FCC will actually

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.770 
three years before the FCC will actually
come<00:03:21.130> out<00:03:21.280> with<00:03:21.459> some<00:03:21.639> guidelines<00:03:22.150> for<00:03:22.420> drones

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
come out with some guidelines for drones

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.680 
come out with some guidelines for drones
that<00:03:23.819> technically<00:03:24.819> we're<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.090> supposed<00:03:25.239> to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
that technically we're not supposed to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.550 
that technically we're not supposed to
fly<00:03:26.019> yeah<00:03:26.920> i<00:03:27.190> think<00:03:27.639> if<00:03:28.209> i<00:03:28.510> had<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.200> without<00:03:29.380> a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
fly yeah i think if i had it without a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.370 
fly yeah i think if i had it without a
camera<00:03:29.889> on<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.160> i<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.639> fly<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.819> anywhere

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
camera on it i can fly it anywhere

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.410 
camera on it i can fly it anywhere
especially<00:03:32.380> here<00:03:32.889> in<00:03:32.920> Los<00:03:33.160> Angeles<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:34.209> what<00:03:34.389> I

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
especially here in Los Angeles if what I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.059 
especially here in Los Angeles if what I
put<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> camera<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.139> it's<00:03:35.319> now<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> problem

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
put a camera on it it's now a problem

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.970 
put a camera on it it's now a problem
which<00:03:36.730> i<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.299> kind<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.169> reverse<00:03:38.650> to

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
which i think is a kind of reverse to

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.949 
which i think is a kind of reverse to
think<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.430> since<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.419> only<00:03:40.540> persons<00:03:40.900> that

in one place i have able to have a fixed
position<00:05:13.539> i<00:05:14.110> have<00:05:14.349> come<00:05:14.620> back<00:05:14.860> if<00:05:15.129> i<00:05:15.310> go<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.819> far

position i have come back if i go so far

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.430 
position i have come back if i go so far
out<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.270> i<00:05:16.419> can't<00:05:16.690> see<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.050> it's<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.259> little

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
out that i can't see it it's a little

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.719 
out that i can't see it it's a little
black<00:05:17.590> data<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.039> get<00:05:18.159> a<00:05:18.190> little<00:05:18.219> switch<00:05:18.580> it

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
black data it get a little switch it

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.040 
black data it get a little switch it
will<00:05:18.819> come<00:05:18.939> right<00:05:19.090> back<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.479> where<00:05:19.689> it<00:05:19.750> take

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
will come right back to where it take

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.709 
will come right back to where it take
off<00:05:20.229> original<00:05:20.770> takeoff<00:05:21.219> position<00:05:21.569> on<00:05:22.569> the

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
off original takeoff position on the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.629 
off original takeoff position on the
bottom<00:05:22.960> we<00:05:23.050> have<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.169> navigation<00:05:23.379> board<00:05:24.069> which

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
bottom we have a navigation board which

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.790 
bottom we have a navigation board which
also<00:05:24.879> has<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.180> compass<00:05:25.930> in<00:05:26.050> it<00:05:26.229> which<00:05:26.680> keeps<00:05:27.039> it

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
also has a compass in it which keeps it

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.309 
also has a compass in it which keeps it
smart<00:05:29.800> basically<00:05:30.310> now<00:05:30.819> it's<00:05:31.210> able<00:05:31.599> to<00:05:31.629> fly<00:05:31.990> and

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
smart basically now it's able to fly and

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:33.839 
smart basically now it's able to fly and
also<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.860> flight<00:05:33.099> control<00:05:33.490> which<00:05:33.639> also

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
also the flight control which also

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.670 
also the flight control which also
controls<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.629> camera<00:05:35.199> mount<00:05:36.569> now

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
controls the camera mount now

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.990 
controls the camera mount now
essentially<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.860> GPS<00:05:39.339> wouldn't<00:05:39.550> that<00:05:39.819> be<00:05:39.969> a

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
essentially the GPS wouldn't that be a

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.790 
essentially the GPS wouldn't that be a
pretty<00:05:40.270> good<00:05:40.479> safety<00:05:40.930> feature<00:05:41.169> in<00:05:41.469> that<00:05:41.650> if

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
pretty good safety feature in that if

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.010 
pretty good safety feature in that if
you<00:05:41.919> lose<00:05:42.159> control<00:05:42.509> very<00:05:43.509> good<00:05:43.719> safety

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
you lose control very good safety

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.709 
you lose control very good safety
feature<00:05:44.229> like<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:44.979> said<00:05:45.250> if<00:05:45.460> whatever<00:05:46.000> reason<00:05:46.539> I

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
feature like I said if whatever reason I

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.079 
feature like I said if whatever reason I
lose<00:05:46.960> orientation<00:05:47.529> if<00:05:48.219> the<00:05:48.490> battery<00:05:48.909> on<00:05:48.940> my

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
lose orientation if the battery on my

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.850 
lose orientation if the battery on my
radio<00:05:49.330> goes<00:05:49.539> dead<00:05:49.750> are<00:05:49.900> just<00:05:50.199> totally<00:05:50.500> lose<00:05:50.830> it

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
radio goes dead are just totally lose it

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.529 
radio goes dead are just totally lose it
all<00:05:51.190> together<00:05:51.370> it's<00:05:52.000> going<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.210> come<00:05:52.360> back

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
all together it's going to come back

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.779 
all together it's going to come back
home<00:05:52.779> no<00:05:52.960> matter<00:05:53.080> what<00:05:53.409> it's<00:05:54.129> smart<00:05:54.460> enough<00:05:54.699> to

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
home no matter what it's smart enough to

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.279 
home no matter what it's smart enough to
know<00:05:54.940> where<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.330> took<00:05:55.449> off<00:05:55.659> from<00:05:55.870> is<00:05:56.080> going<00:05:56.229> to

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
know where it took off from is going to

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.290 
know where it took off from is going to
come<00:05:56.409> right<00:05:56.620> back<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:57.009> their<00:05:57.219> and<00:05:57.460> hover<00:05:58.000> and

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
come right back to their and hover and

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.610 
come right back to their and hover and
land<00:05:58.659> itself<00:05:59.819> well<00:06:00.819> when<00:06:01.779> can<00:06:02.139> we<00:06:02.289> take<00:06:02.469> this

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
land itself well when can we take this

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:31.540 
land itself well when can we take this
baby<00:06:02.889> up

their fly I'm losing that lithium

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.689 
their fly I'm losing that lithium
battery<00:07:20.289> which<00:07:21.289> is<00:07:21.319> biodegradable<00:07:21.800> I<00:07:22.399> can

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:22.699 
battery which is biodegradable I can

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.309 
battery which is biodegradable I can
just<00:07:22.819> discharge<00:07:23.329> it<00:07:23.509> though<00:07:23.839> in<00:07:23.989> a<00:07:24.079> trash<00:07:24.289> can

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 
just discharge it though in a trash can

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.189 
just discharge it though in a trash can
and<00:07:24.709> will<00:07:24.829> not<00:07:24.979> pollute<00:07:25.599> anything<00:07:26.599> other

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
and will not pollute anything other

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.259 
and will not pollute anything other
better<00:07:27.349> as<00:07:27.499> well<00:07:27.709> so<00:07:28.279> this<00:07:28.550> is<00:07:28.729> somewhat<00:07:29.089> of<00:07:29.119> a

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:29.269 
better as well so this is somewhat of a

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:50.559 
better as well so this is somewhat of a
green<00:07:29.479> business

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:50.569
