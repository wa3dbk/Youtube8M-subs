00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
points of palm muting and I know some of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.830 
points of palm muting and I know some of
you<00:00:08.340> watching<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:09.000> went<00:00:09.179> wait<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> minute

you watching just went wait a minute
Paul<00:00:10.410> muting<00:00:11.059> there<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.330> finer<00:00:12.599> points<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
Paul muting there are finer points to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760 
Paul muting there are finer points to
palm<00:00:13.740> muting<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.900> you<00:00:15.900> know<00:00:15.990> while<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> one

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
palm muting and you know while it is one

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680 
palm muting and you know while it is one
of<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> most<00:00:17.070> basic<00:00:17.220> things<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.390> metal

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
of the most basic things in all of metal

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.950 
of the most basic things in all of metal
I<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.619> prepared<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.699> wager<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.810> at

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
I would be prepared to wager that at

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.750 
I would be prepared to wager that at
least<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.560> person<00:00:22.920> watching<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.250> video<00:00:23.519> has

least one person watching this video has
not<00:00:23.970> considered<00:00:24.660> some<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> things<00:00:25.439> I'm

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
not considered some of the things I'm

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.679 
not considered some of the things I'm
going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> present<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.449> let's<00:00:27.449> dive<00:00:27.660> right

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
going to present here let's dive right

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.349 
going to present here let's dive right
in<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.490> point<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> palm<00:00:30.060> muting

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
in now the first point to palm muting

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
in now the first point to palm muting
that<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:30.990> say<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.500> consider<00:00:31.769> is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
that I would say we have to consider is

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
that I would say we have to consider is
the<00:00:33.350> horizontal<00:00:34.350> aspect<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.430> where<00:00:35.760> are

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the horizontal aspect you know where are

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.310 
the horizontal aspect you know where are
we<00:00:36.899> placing<00:00:37.140> our<00:00:37.559> palm<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> bridge

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we placing our palm on the on the bridge

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.780 
we placing our palm on the on the bridge
because<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> makes<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> drastic<00:00:41.670> difference

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
because it makes a drastic difference

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.549 
because it makes a drastic difference
for<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:44.870> compared<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.050> all

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
for you down here compared to here all

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
for you down here compared to here all
the<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.860> here

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.930 

you<00:00:58.840> can<00:00:58.990> hear<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.230> gets<00:00:59.410> progressively<00:00:59.940> less

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
you can hear it gets progressively less

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.970 
you can hear it gets progressively less
Basie<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:02.260> can<00:01:02.410> actually<00:01:02.560> end<00:01:02.890> up

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
Basie and you can actually end up

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.160 
Basie and you can actually end up
bending<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.670> open<00:01:03.970> note<00:01:04.150> up<00:01:04.330> slightly<00:01:04.960> if

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
bending that open note up slightly if

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.390 
bending that open note up slightly if
you<00:01:05.290> get<00:01:05.410> a<00:01:05.440> little<00:01:05.620> too<00:01:05.860> high<00:01:06.040> up<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.370> your

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
you get a little too high up on your

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.780 
you get a little too high up on your
bridge<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.110> both<00:01:08.110> have<00:01:08.920> their<00:01:09.130> place<00:01:09.370> I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
bridge and both have their place I

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.090 
bridge and both have their place I
personally<00:01:10.570> tend<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.870> favor<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.500> bass<00:01:11.860> ear

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
personally tend to favor the bass ear

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.149 
personally tend to favor the bass ear
end<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.540> something<00:01:14.170> like

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.319 

I<00:01:17.359> love<00:01:18.359> that<00:01:19.249> sustained<00:01:20.249> chug<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.179> get

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
I love that sustained chug that we get

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.389 
I love that sustained chug that we get
out<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.749> but<00:01:22.289> some<00:01:22.499> people<00:01:22.829> would<00:01:23.039> instead

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
out of it but some people would instead

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.660 
out of it but some people would instead
play<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> more<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:27.979> that's<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.219> common<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
play it more like that's more common in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.279 
play it more like that's more common in
things<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:29.909> Ghent<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.780> another<00:01:30.959> thing<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
things like Ghent now another thing to

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.929 
things like Ghent now another thing to
consider<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> actual<00:01:32.340> angle<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.909> your

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
consider is the actual angle of your

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.690 
consider is the actual angle of your
pick<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.280> different<00:01:35.549> sound

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
pick you get a very different sound

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.370 
pick you get a very different sound
depending<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.599> you've<00:01:36.719> got<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.929> completely

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
depending on if you've got a completely

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.800 
depending on if you've got a completely
horizontal<00:01:38.039> like<00:01:38.219> this<00:01:40.490> or<00:01:41.810> somewhat

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
horizontal like this or somewhat

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
horizontal like this or somewhat
vertical

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.490 

and<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:54.960> would<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.230> point

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
and one other thing I would really point

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.680 
and one other thing I would really point
out<00:01:55.590> along<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> same<00:01:56.820> line<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.540> want

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
out along that same line you really want

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.540 
out along that same line you really want
to<00:01:57.780> pick<00:01:57.930> through<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.710> string<00:01:59.010> don't<00:01:59.370> just

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
to pick through the string don't just

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.120 
to pick through the string don't just
pick<00:01:59.700> it

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
pick it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.429 
pick it
really

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
really

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.200 
really
in<00:02:03.859> it<00:02:04.039> hard<00:02:04.340> go<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.909> way<00:02:04.939> through

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
in it hard go all the way through

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.809 
in it hard go all the way through
another<00:02:06.109> aspect<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.710> palm<00:02:06.859> muting<00:02:07.189> we<00:02:07.549> should

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
another aspect of palm muting we should

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.219 
another aspect of palm muting we should
really<00:02:07.969> think<00:02:08.060> about<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:08.869> difference

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
really think about is the difference

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.900 
really think about is the difference
between<00:02:09.289> down<00:02:09.800> picking<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.489> alternate

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
between down picking and alternate

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.660 
between down picking and alternate
picking<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.349> difference<00:02:12.769> you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
picking because that is a difference you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.309 
picking because that is a difference you
know<00:02:13.760> if<00:02:13.879> you're<00:02:13.970> chugging<00:02:14.180> something<00:02:15.170> like

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
know if you're chugging something like

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.970 
know if you're chugging something like
this<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:16.220> straight<00:02:16.549> open<00:02:17.180> chug

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.289 

that's<00:02:21.980> down<00:02:22.280> picked<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:22.849> if<00:02:22.940> we<00:02:23.120> were<00:02:23.239> to

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
that's down picked but if we were to

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.490 
that's down picked but if we were to
alternate<00:02:23.750> pick<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.140> would<00:02:24.230> sound<00:02:24.410> like

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
alternate pick it it would sound like

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:36.220 
alternate pick it it would sound like
this<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.660> reason<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.959> get<00:02:36.079> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this and the reason we get that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.229 
this and the reason we get that
difference<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.700> we're<00:02:37.849> alternate

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
difference is when we're alternate

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.759 
difference is when we're alternate
picking<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> up<00:02:38.959> pick<00:02:39.230> we're<00:02:39.410> hitting<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
picking on the up pick we're hitting the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.580 
picking on the up pick we're hitting the
higher<00:02:40.010> strings<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> power<00:02:40.910> cord<00:02:41.180> first

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
higher strings in the power cord first

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.539 
higher strings in the power cord first
which<00:02:42.590> does<00:02:42.860> create<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.220> different<00:02:43.459> sound

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
which does create a different sound

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.339 
which does create a different sound
however<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.060> less<00:02:44.299> noticeable<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:45.110> you're

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
however it's less noticeable if you're

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.300 
however it's less noticeable if you're
just<00:02:45.560> palm<00:02:46.459> muting<00:02:46.790> an<00:02:46.879> open<00:02:47.150> string

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.309 

so<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.360> really<00:02:54.660> depends<00:02:54.990> on<00:02:55.050> what<00:02:55.170> you're

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
so it really depends on what you're

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.620 
so it really depends on what you're
playing<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.830> well<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:57.150> right<00:02:57.330> that's<00:02:57.510> gonna
