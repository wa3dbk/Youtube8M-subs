the different games play this one is a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
the different games play this one is a
gravity<00:00:28.439> crush<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.859> go<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.010> hit<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> play

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
gravity crush so go and hit the play

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.769 
gravity crush so go and hit the play
button<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> corner<00:00:29.820> there<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
button in the corner there so this is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
button in the corner there so this is
all<00:00:30.990> tilt<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.590> using<00:00:31.710> six<00:00:32.099> axis<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.910> is

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
all tilt so it's using six axis this is

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
all tilt so it's using six axis this is
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.390> show<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:34.410> precise<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
going to really show you how precise the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.209 
going to really show you how precise the
device<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.390> again<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.870> tilt<00:00:37.219> back

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
device is so again if you tilt back

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.860 
device is so again if you tilt back
you'll<00:00:38.520> slow<00:00:38.790> down<00:00:38.969> till<00:00:39.300> forward<00:00:39.719> you'll

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
you'll slow down till forward you'll

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.290 
you'll slow down till forward you'll
speed<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.260> till<00:00:40.559> left<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> right<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.149> there

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
speed up till left and right so there

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.639 
speed up till left and right so there
you<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> want<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> pick<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> Stars<00:00:43.440> but

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you go you want to pick up the Stars but

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.500 
you go you want to pick up the Stars but

you go you go up a little bit now you're
trying<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.670> bottom<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.030> these

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
trying to get to the bottom of these

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
trying to get to the bottom of these
mines<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.719> pick<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> bomb<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> can

mines and pick up the bomb is you can
eat<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.640> it'll<00:00:50.760> explode<00:00:51.210> inside<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
eat it and it'll explode inside you and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810 
eat it and it'll explode inside you and
you<00:00:51.899> save<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> humans<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> don't

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you save the humans so there you don't

you save the humans so there you don't
now<00:00:54.059> let's<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> next<00:00:54.690> wave<00:00:54.989> every<00:00:55.680> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
now let's go to the next wave every one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.770 
now let's go to the next wave every one
of<00:00:55.860> these<00:00:55.980> levels<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.670> multiple<00:00:57.180> waves<00:00:57.420> 10

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
of these levels have multiple waves 10

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
of these levels have multiple waves 10
20<00:00:58.199> 30<00:00:58.410> level<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.070> waves<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.730> along<00:00:59.879> with

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
20 30 level I waves that go along with

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
20 30 level I waves that go along with
the<00:01:00.690> 30<00:01:00.899> plus<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:01.920> go

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the 30 plus all this go back go back go

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.179 
the 30 plus all this go back go back go
up<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
up go there you go all right so in it is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
up go there you go all right so in it is
very<00:01:05.430> precise<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.600> flying<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
very precise this is like flying with a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
very precise this is like flying with a
joystick<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.580> motion

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
joystick but it's actually your motion

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.429 
joystick but it's actually your motion
that's<00:01:09.150> controlling<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.840> we're<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> little

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that's controlling it we're a little

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
that's controlling it we're a little
forgiving<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> early<00:01:11.400> portions<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
forgiving in the early portions here you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.399 
forgiving in the early portions here you
see<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> finish<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
see you finish that one with two and a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
see you finish that one with two and a
half<00:01:13.560> seconds<00:01:14.010> left<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:15.299> again<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.630> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
half seconds left now again you're going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
half seconds left now again you're going
to<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:15.960> wave<00:01:16.320> after<00:01:16.530> wave<00:01:16.680> each<00:01:17.100> one's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to go through wave after wave each one's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.560 
to go through wave after wave each one's
going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:17.820> difficult<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> them

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to get more difficult some of them

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
going to get more difficult some of them
are<00:01:18.630> gonna<00:01:18.750> start<00:01:18.900> throwing<00:01:19.140> curveballs

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
are gonna start throwing curveballs

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
are gonna start throwing curveballs
ideas<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.250> starting<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> hang

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
ideas so you're starting to get a hang

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.969 
ideas so you're starting to get a hang
of<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.210> avoid<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.600> vortex<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> oh<00:01:22.409> god

gonna go ahead and get through this wave

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.340 
gonna go ahead and get through this wave
here<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.600> we'll<00:02:08.720> probably<00:02:08.990> go<00:02:09.200> ahead<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
on it and the deviance are going to come

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.000 
on it and the deviance are going to come
out<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.019> want<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> hit<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.440> deviance<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
out you want to hit the deviance in the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.979 
out you want to hit the deviance in the
face<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:29.060> they<00:02:29.209> come<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:29.510> facing<00:02:29.870> you

won't lose time later on they'll start

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.420 
won't lose time later on they'll start
dressing<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.380> like<00:02:39.470> deviants<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.190> become

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
dressing up like deviants and become

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.979 
dressing up like deviants and become
even<00:02:40.700> more<00:02:40.730> crazy<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.420> there<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.630> go<00:02:41.690> front

even more crazy so there you go front

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.699 
even more crazy so there you go front
touch<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:43.160> back<00:02:43.370> touch<00:02:43.810> well<00:02:44.810> done<00:02:45.019> what<00:02:45.560> this

can't see where you're touching you get

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.330 
can't see where you're touching you get
more<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.049> more<00:02:51.200> comfortable<00:02:51.530> where<00:02:52.040> things

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.710 
teach you those gameplay mechanics and i
will<00:03:00.950> start<00:03:01.220> speeding<00:03:01.519> up<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.299> time<00:03:02.690> is

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
will start speeding up now the time is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.110 
will start speeding up now the time is
good<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.680> bonus<00:03:04.010> time<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:04.340> good<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.640> cats<00:03:04.910> are

thousand three hundred points you're
currently<00:03:31.880> at<00:03:32.030> 1800<00:03:32.630> just<00:03:32.930> thought<00:03:33.049> I'd<00:03:33.170> point

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
currently at 1800 just thought I'd point

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.140 
currently at 1800 just thought I'd point
that<00:03:33.709> out<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.010> let's<00:03:34.160> say<00:03:34.250> no<00:03:34.670> pressure<00:03:34.940> no

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
that out you let's say no pressure no

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.190 
that out you let's say no pressure no
pressure

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
pressure

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.410 
pressure
there's<00:03:37.010> over<00:03:37.190> 30<00:03:37.489> different<00:03:37.670> levels<00:03:38.120> that

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
there's over 30 different levels that

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.280 
there's over 30 different levels that
are<00:03:38.480> going<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.750> each<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.170> different

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
are going to each have different

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.479 
are going to each have different
gameplay<00:03:39.770> mechanics<00:03:40.190> we're<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
gameplay mechanics we're going to

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.680 
gameplay mechanics we're going to
leverage<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.910> different<00:03:41.150> mechanics<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
leverage the different mechanics and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.170 
leverage the different mechanics and
build<00:03:41.930> up<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.860> like<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.610> may<00:03:43.760> see<00:03:43.819> this

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
build up so like you may see this

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.910 
build up so like you may see this
initially<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.930> then<00:03:44.959> later<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:45.319> it'll<00:03:45.709> have

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
initially and then later on it'll have

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.949 
initially and then later on it'll have
another<00:03:46.519> gameplay<00:03:46.730> mechanic<00:03:47.300> tossed<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.720> or

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
another gameplay mechanic tossed in or

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.530 
another gameplay mechanic tossed in or
gravity<00:03:48.800> rush<00:03:48.950> out<00:03:49.129> there<00:03:49.849> warning<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.330> don't

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
gravity rush out there warning you don't

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.990 
gravity rush out there warning you don't
start<00:03:51.080> stop<00:03:51.620> hitting<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.099> humans<00:03:52.550> you're

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
start stop hitting the humans you're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.420 
start stop hitting the humans you're
losing<00:03:53.450> time<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:57.910> know<00:03:59.620> time<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.650> good<00:04:01.069> they're

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
losing time I know time is good they're

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.949 
losing time I know time is good they're
telling<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.849> pick<00:04:02.030> up<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.269> time<00:04:02.450> in<00:04:02.720> the

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
telling you pick up the time in the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.630 
telling you pick up the time in the
lower<00:04:03.140> left-hand<00:04:03.470> corner<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:04.430> will<00:04:04.519> give

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
lower left-hand corner that will give

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.670 
lower left-hand corner that will give
you<00:04:04.730> 15<00:04:05.060> more<00:04:05.269> seconds<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:05.930> you're<00:04:06.170> running

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
you 15 more seconds so you're running

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.440 
you 15 more seconds so you're running
low<00:04:06.860> on<00:04:06.890> time<00:04:09.400> nicely<00:04:10.400> done<00:04:10.549> okay<00:04:11.000> he's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
low on time nicely done okay he's

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.610 
low on time nicely done okay he's
playing<00:04:11.690> along<00:04:11.930> i'm<00:04:12.080> sure<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.319> guys<00:04:12.380> are

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
playing along i'm sure you guys are

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.530 
playing along i'm sure you guys are
hearing<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.920> audio<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.250> there<00:04:13.580> as<00:04:13.730> it<00:04:14.360> gets

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
hearing the audio on there as it gets

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.840 
hearing the audio on there as it gets
more<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.810> more<00:04:14.900> pressure<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.590> there<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.609> go

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
more and more pressure and there you go

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.729 
more and more pressure and there you go
so<00:04:17.479> again<00:04:17.690> each<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.200> new<00:04:18.290> mechanics

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
so again each one of the new mechanics

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.009 
so again each one of the new mechanics
are<00:04:18.859> going<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.040> have<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.750> varying<00:04:20.750> level

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
are going to have a varying level

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.090 
are going to have a varying level
complexity<00:04:21.560> they'll<00:04:21.709> get<00:04:21.799> more<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.070> more

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
complexity they'll get more and more

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.830 
complexity they'll get more and more
challenging<00:04:22.550> as<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.760> go<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.479> may<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.660> a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
challenging as you go and you may see a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960 
challenging as you go and you may see a
revisit<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.590> exit<00:04:24.860> arrow<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.669> may<00:04:25.790> see<00:04:25.850> a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
revisit the exit arrow you may see a

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.790 
revisit the exit arrow you may see a
revisit<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.540> them<00:04:26.690> later<00:04:26.930> on<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> game<00:04:27.440> at

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
revisit to them later on in the game at

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.620 
revisit to them later on in the game at
a<00:04:27.830> higher<00:04:28.100> level<00:04:28.130> where<00:04:28.700> for<00:04:29.240> instance<00:04:29.270> we're

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
a higher level where for instance we're

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.790 
a higher level where for instance we're
going<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.810> go<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.169> whole<00:04:30.290> roll<00:04:30.500> control

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
going to go and do a whole roll control

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.490 
going to go and do a whole roll control
here<00:04:31.100> real<00:04:31.250> quick<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:31.970> last<00:04:32.150> one<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:33.320> then

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
here real quick so the last one and then

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.930 
here real quick so the last one and then
we<00:04:33.620> might<00:04:33.770> do<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.100> more<00:04:34.310> where<00:04:34.490> we<00:04:34.580> stand<00:04:34.820> up

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
we might do one more where we stand up

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.580 
we might do one more where we stand up
and<00:04:35.120> really<00:04:35.419> flail<00:04:35.660> around<00:04:35.810> whole<00:04:36.410> roll

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
and really flail around whole roll

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.310 
and really flail around whole roll
control<00:04:36.860> is<00:04:37.130> strictly<00:04:37.729> back<00:04:37.970> touch<00:04:38.240> with<00:04:39.139> one

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
control is strictly back touch with one

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.260 
control is strictly back touch with one
button<00:04:39.530> on<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.770> front<00:04:39.860> but<00:04:40.430> back<00:04:40.700> touch<00:04:40.970> and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
button on the front but back touch and

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.159 
button on the front but back touch and
what<00:04:41.479> you're<00:04:41.600> doing<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.900> terrain

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
what you're doing is terrain

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.300 
what you're doing is terrain
deformations<00:04:42.740> you're<00:04:42.919> going<00:04:43.039> to<00:04:43.100> push<00:04:43.280> a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
deformations you're going to push a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.980 
deformations you're going to push a
ridge<00:04:43.580> up<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.000> try<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.180> roll<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.630> deviant

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
ridge up and try and roll the deviant

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.110 
ridge up and try and roll the deviant
around<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:46.130> like<00:04:46.280> combining<00:04:46.669> marble

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
around so this is like combining marble

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.860 
around so this is like combining marble
madness<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.870> surfing<00:04:48.850> with<00:04:49.850> alien<00:04:50.479> robots

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
madness and surfing with alien robots

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.180 
madness and surfing with alien robots
chasing<00:04:51.289> after<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:51.770> you're<00:04:51.889> going<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.070> try

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
chasing after you so you're going to try

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.340 
chasing after you so you're going to try
and<00:04:52.220> get<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.639> vortex<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.960> go<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.169> press

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
and get to the vortex so go and press

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.590 
and get to the vortex so go and press
the<00:04:54.500> touch<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:54.950> back<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.550> see<00:04:56.090> how<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.360> can

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
the touch the back a see how you can

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.390 
the touch the back a see how you can
basically<00:04:56.840> roll<00:04:57.229> around<00:04:57.500> there<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.100> get<00:04:58.280> him

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
basically roll around there and get him

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.680 
basically roll around there and get him
going<00:04:58.580> in<00:04:58.729> front<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.180> look<00:04:59.450> for<00:04:59.630> the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
going in front of you and look for the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.320 
going in front of you and look for the
vortex<00:05:00.139> keys<00:05:01.010> or<00:05:01.280> good<00:05:01.520> stars<00:05:01.970> are<00:05:02.210> good

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
vortex keys or good stars are good

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.450 
vortex keys or good stars are good
and<00:05:04.840> again<00:05:05.080> initially<00:05:05.590> you'll<00:05:05.740> do<00:05:05.919> when<00:05:06.340> you

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
and again initially you'll do when you

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.100 
and again initially you'll do when you
pick<00:05:06.669> up<00:05:06.759> the<00:05:06.909> key<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.210> opens<00:05:07.479> up<00:05:07.569> the<00:05:07.689> vortex

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
pick up the key it opens up the vortex

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.379 
pick up the key it opens up the vortex
and<00:05:08.259> that's<00:05:08.439> how<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.650> get<00:05:08.919> out<00:05:09.069> so<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:10.090> you're

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
and that's how you get out so as you're

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.760 
and that's how you get out so as you're
playing<00:05:10.479> through<00:05:10.840> these<00:05:10.990> your<00:05:11.289> initial

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
playing through these your initial

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.809 
playing through these your initial
you'll<00:05:11.949> find<00:05:12.189> you're<00:05:12.340> doing<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> lot<00:05:12.759> of

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
you'll find you're doing a lot of

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.850 
you'll find you're doing a lot of
massive<00:05:13.270> adjustments<00:05:13.780> later<00:05:14.259> on<00:05:14.500> you'll<00:05:14.650> find

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
massive adjustments later on you'll find

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.990 
massive adjustments later on you'll find
out<00:05:14.949> wait<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.129> second<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.550> can<00:05:15.729> pretty<00:05:15.879> much

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
out wait a second I can pretty much

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.909 
out wait a second I can pretty much
guide<00:05:16.389> him<00:05:16.599> completely<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.740> by<00:05:17.860> getting

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
guide him completely just by getting

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.520 
guide him completely just by getting
behind<00:05:18.250> him<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.729> let<00:05:18.909> him<00:05:18.939> roll<00:05:19.479> Oh<00:05:19.780> robot<00:05:20.409> 8

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
behind him and let him roll Oh robot 8

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.080 
behind him and let him roll Oh robot 8
you<00:05:20.680> took<00:05:21.219> a<00:05:21.310> little<00:05:21.460> bit<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.669> health<00:05:21.879> damage

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
you took a little bit of health damage

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.270 
you took a little bit of health damage
there<00:05:22.509> and<00:05:22.719> made<00:05:23.469> that<00:05:23.680> level<00:05:23.949> now<00:05:24.099> if<00:05:24.159> you'll

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
there and made that level now if you'll

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.189 
there and made that level now if you'll
notice<00:05:24.400> your<00:05:24.580> health<00:05:24.759> didn't<00:05:25.030> return<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:26.020> as

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
notice your health didn't return so as

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.240 
notice your health didn't return so as
you're<00:05:26.409> playing<00:05:26.530> you're<00:05:26.830> going<00:05:26.949> to<00:05:27.009> steadily

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
you're playing you're going to steadily

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.559 
you're playing you're going to steadily
get<00:05:27.460> less<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.699> less<00:05:27.879> health<00:05:28.150> so<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.419> you

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
get less and less health so that you

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.730 
get less and less health so that you
will<00:05:28.659> find<00:05:28.900> pickups<00:05:29.319> that'll<00:05:29.560> make<00:05:29.620> you

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
will find pickups that'll make you

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.589 
will find pickups that'll make you
better<00:05:31.080> oh<00:05:32.490> yeah<00:05:33.490> here<00:05:33.729> we<00:05:33.879> go<00:05:33.909> back<00:05:34.240> after<00:05:34.419> him

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
better oh yeah here we go back after him

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.020 
better oh yeah here we go back after him
again<00:05:34.659> maybe<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.110> can<00:05:35.199> get<00:05:35.289> him<00:05:35.819> then<00:05:36.819> now

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
again maybe you can get him then now

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.129 
again maybe you can get him then now
there's<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.300> wall<00:05:37.419> so<00:05:37.569> you<00:05:37.629> got<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.840> go<00:05:37.930> all<00:05:38.110> the

there's a wall so you got to go all the

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.379 
there's a wall so you got to go all the
way<00:05:38.289> around<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:39.340> swing<00:05:39.639> around<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:40.030> edge<00:05:40.150> to

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
way around and swing around the edge to

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.279 
way around and swing around the edge to
the<00:05:40.479> far<00:05:40.629> right<00:05:40.900> oh<00:05:41.699> that<00:05:42.699> help<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:44.169> was

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
the far right oh that help you that was

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.969 
the far right oh that help you that was
worth<00:05:44.469> it<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:47.229> it's<00:05:47.860> getting<00:05:48.069> more<00:05:48.280> crowded

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
worth it and it's getting more crowded

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.040 
worth it and it's getting more crowded
hey<00:05:50.979> nicely<00:05:51.639> done<00:05:51.849> so<00:05:52.330> again<00:05:52.569> as<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.810> as

hey nicely done so again as you as
you're<00:05:53.199> playing<00:05:53.289> through<00:05:53.620> little<00:05:53.860> more<00:05:54.009> and

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
you're playing through little more and

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.439 
you're playing through little more and
more<00:05:54.219> complex<00:05:54.400> giving<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.000> different<00:05:55.300> robots

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
more complex giving a different robots

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.760 
more complex giving a different robots
of<00:05:55.750> your<00:05:55.870> having<00:05:56.110> to<00:05:56.169> fight<00:05:56.349> against<00:05:56.590> giving

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
of your having to fight against giving

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.459 
of your having to fight against giving
and<00:05:56.979> get<00:05:57.099> more<00:05:57.219> challenging<00:05:57.819> environments

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
and get more challenging environments

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.110 
and get more challenging environments
later<00:05:59.469> on<00:05:59.680> you<00:05:59.889> know<00:05:59.979> as<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.460> encounter<00:06:00.759> this

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
later on you know as you encounter this

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.670 
later on you know as you encounter this
level<00:06:01.449> later<00:06:01.900> in<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.139> game<00:06:02.289> it'll<00:06:02.529> be

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
level later in the game it'll be

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.869 
level later in the game it'll be
multiple<00:06:03.159> fingers<00:06:03.310> so<00:06:03.520> you<00:06:03.610> can<00:06:03.729> actually

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
multiple fingers so you can actually

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.119 
multiple fingers so you can actually
widen<00:06:04.449> up<00:06:04.509> on<00:06:04.629> a<00:06:04.719> ridge<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.229> push<00:06:05.650> multiple

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
widen up on a ridge and push multiple

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.189 
widen up on a ridge and push multiple
deviants<00:06:06.490> at<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.639> timer<00:06:06.849> at<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.360> back<00:06:07.689> tap<00:06:08.020> the

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
deviants at a timer at the back tap the

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.409 
deviants at a timer at the back tap the
back<00:06:08.319> touch<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.830> make<00:06:08.860> them<00:06:09.099> jump<00:06:09.370> so<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.120> know

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
back touch to make them jump so you know

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.909 
back touch to make them jump so you know
right<00:06:10.719> now<00:06:10.870> it's<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.169> very<00:06:11.349> simple<00:06:11.650> thing<00:06:11.710> this

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
right now it's a very simple thing this

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.140 
right now it's a very simple thing this
is<00:06:12.009> one<00:06:12.129> of<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.279> earliest<00:06:12.310> levels<00:06:12.969> in<00:06:13.060> the

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
is one of the earliest levels in the

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.580 
is one of the earliest levels in the
game<00:06:13.180> but<00:06:13.779> we're<00:06:13.840> going<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.020> continue<00:06:14.199> adding

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
game but we're going to continue adding

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.779 
game but we're going to continue adding
complexity<00:06:15.129> and<00:06:15.340> making<00:06:15.550> it<00:06:15.580> more

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
complexity and making it more

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.420 
complexity and making it more
challenging<00:06:16.289> but<00:06:17.289> I<00:06:17.319> think<00:06:17.560> once<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.099> get<00:06:18.279> out

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
challenging but I think once you get out

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.950 
challenging but I think once you get out
of<00:06:18.460> this<00:06:18.639> exit<00:06:19.060> here<00:06:19.330> we're<00:06:19.569> going<00:06:19.659> to<00:06:19.750> go

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
of this exit here we're going to go

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.420 
of this exit here we're going to go
ahead

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.700 

there<00:06:23.030> it<00:06:23.180> is<00:06:23.270> okay<00:06:23.720> all<00:06:24.080> right<00:06:24.200> guys<00:06:24.380> we<00:06:24.590> got

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
there it is okay all right guys we got

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.750 
there it is okay all right guys we got
one<00:06:24.740> last<00:06:25.010> game<00:06:25.160> we're<00:06:25.280> going<00:06:25.370> to<00:06:25.430> show<00:06:25.610> here

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
one last game we're going to show here

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.310 
one last game we're going to show here
which<00:06:25.880> is<00:06:26.000> bots<00:06:26.270> blast<00:06:26.660> this<00:06:26.930> is<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.110> little

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
which is bots blast this is a little

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.600 
which is bots blast this is a little
more<00:06:27.410> challenging<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:27.980> film<00:06:28.190> so<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.370> hope<00:06:28.460> you

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
more challenging the film so I hope you

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.770 
more challenging the film so I hope you
guys<00:06:28.700> don't<00:06:28.910> get<00:06:29.060> sick<00:06:29.270> back<00:06:29.450> at<00:06:29.600> home<00:06:29.750> but

trying to chase around and shoot the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.520 
trying to chase around and shoot the
robots<00:06:37.340> and<00:06:37.550> save<00:06:37.790> the<00:06:38.030> deviants<00:06:38.480> now<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.020> big

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
robots and save the deviants now the big

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.140 
robots and save the deviants now the big
challenge<00:06:39.920> is<00:06:40.070> Oh<00:06:40.250> yep<00:06:40.460> you<00:06:40.640> gotta<00:06:40.820> power<00:06:41.030> up

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
challenge is Oh yep you gotta power up

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.030 
challenge is Oh yep you gotta power up
there<00:06:41.450> so<00:06:41.600> we've<00:06:41.780> now<00:06:41.960> got<00:06:42.170> a<00:06:42.200> missile<00:06:42.560> so<00:06:42.950> if

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
there so we've now got a missile so if

there so we've now got a missile so if
you<00:06:43.160> see<00:06:43.430> one<00:06:43.700> and<00:06:43.820> you<00:06:43.910> get<00:06:44.030> a<00:06:44.060> lock<00:06:44.270> on<00:06:44.420> you

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
you see one and you get a lock on you

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.820 
you see one and you get a lock on you
can<00:06:44.720> actually<00:06:44.840> launch<00:06:45.110> a<00:06:45.200> missile<00:06:45.350> by<00:06:45.560> hitting

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
can actually launch a missile by hitting

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.020 
can actually launch a missile by hitting
the<00:06:45.920> button<00:06:46.220> in<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.430> lower<00:06:46.580> left<00:06:46.670> hand<00:06:46.910> corner

there you go it killed him too quickly
so<00:06:50.480> again<00:06:50.930> I<00:06:50.960> go<00:06:51.500> on<00:06:51.650> the<00:06:51.740> screen<00:06:51.950> go<00:06:52.100> and<00:06:52.250> wipe

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
so again I go on the screen go and wipe

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.160 
so again I go on the screen go and wipe
that<00:06:52.490> off<00:06:52.550> for<00:06:52.820> me<00:06:52.910> there<00:06:53.060> you<00:06:53.180> go<00:06:53.330> so<00:06:53.510> again<00:06:54.020> as

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
you're going on we're going to do front

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.010 
you're going on we're going to do front
touchback<00:06:56.120> touch<00:06:56.420> augmented<00:06:56.990> reality

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
touchback touch augmented reality

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.710 
touchback touch augmented reality
sixaxis<00:06:57.890> back<00:06:58.400> camera<00:06:58.910> they<00:06:59.330> were<00:06:59.480> just<00:06:59.540> going

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
sixaxis back camera they were just going

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.140 
sixaxis back camera they were just going
to<00:06:59.810> continue<00:06:59.930> adding<00:07:00.380> more<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:00.770> more

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
to continue adding more and more

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.220 
to continue adding more and more
components<00:07:02.150> into<00:07:02.330> the<00:07:02.360> levels<00:07:02.900> making<00:07:03.080> them

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
components into the levels making them

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.540 
components into the levels making them
more<00:07:03.380> and<00:07:03.470> more<00:07:03.590> challenging<00:07:03.980> that<00:07:04.310> one<00:07:04.460> with

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
more and more challenging that one with

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.860 
more and more challenging that one with
the<00:07:04.580> tentacles<00:07:04.820> he's<00:07:05.240> the<00:07:05.360> one<00:07:05.480> throwing<00:07:05.690> the

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
the tentacles he's the one throwing the

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.310 
the tentacles he's the one throwing the
goo<00:07:06.050> at<00:07:06.230> you<00:07:06.440> get<00:07:07.070> him<00:07:07.190> get<00:07:07.460> him<00:07:07.720> area<00:07:08.720> oh<00:07:08.930> wait

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
goo at you get him get him area oh wait

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.310 
goo at you get him get him area oh wait
Oh<00:07:09.560> can't<00:07:09.890> even<00:07:10.100> see<00:07:10.280> him<00:07:10.400> can't<00:07:10.670> even<00:07:10.880> see<00:07:11.000> him

Oh can't even see him can't even see him
so<00:07:12.320> again<00:07:12.560> BOTS<00:07:12.770> blast<00:07:13.070> is<00:07:13.280> an<00:07:13.370> augmented

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
so again BOTS blast is an augmented

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.040 
so again BOTS blast is an augmented
reality<00:07:14.180> game<00:07:14.300> and<00:07:14.420> its<00:07:14.540> really<00:07:14.630> showing<00:07:14.750> the

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
reality game and its really showing the

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.900 
reality game and its really showing the
true<00:07:15.170> promise<00:07:15.650> of<00:07:15.860> what's<00:07:16.400> possible<00:07:16.460> with
