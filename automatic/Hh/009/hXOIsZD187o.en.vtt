00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:10.710
 and then people took good so let's go 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 try here and past hbm level of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.210
 last time i stopped at the last wave 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.140
 I'm not the woman of configuration. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 on this basis that I'm afraid 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 basically it is 600 ac laren the walls 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 when the enemies have here and there 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.560
 This may give shit but let's see what 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560
 will, give 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.140
 maintaining its end 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 first let's go there my hope here 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.870
 no they would not enjoy it would be very good 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 if he told me there is not and the market 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.040
 I already know that the average 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.649
 So when you're making the base 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.289
 of you have to be very careful with the 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:30.509
 Colonel Claudio explained note if one more 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:32.490
 filler here for little competitive ets 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 very important I find it very difficult 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.289
 that you get past 3 but we'll see the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.450
 what are you going to give 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.989
 if you lose another now you still have 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.989
 hope 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.640
 I want to start at least cupid like 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.410
 was it not kulang is actually here 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.510
 It's one more body then if I had 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.720
 maybe put if iraq did it 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 outside and against attacking 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.819
 maybe it works or people it usually 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.819
 killed 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:46.269
 Good, I hope to end these screams before 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:48.810
 let the crowd get as far as this scene is 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.810
 of 3 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.810
 come on 4 depends on main actor who 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:07.440
 will fall into the same trap 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 simon all just was not very 7% holy 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.600
 It's not deadly to have everything would be much more 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.290
 easy 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.420
 I was also a child today but he did not 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.850
 I was in the dead and killed 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:30.000
 a psychologist in the goofy room there is 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:37.770
 This I did not take, nothing died, I died. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.480
 another is still unable to stay 5 was 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.480
 next such reason to avail
