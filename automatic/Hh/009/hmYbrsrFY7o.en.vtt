those little white spots on them and

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.060 
those little white spots on them and
it's<00:04:53.729> just<00:04:54.000> like<00:04:54.500> chances<00:04:55.500> are<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.680> fish

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
it's just like chances are that fish

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.110 
it's just like chances are that fish

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
you can get around that though I think

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.320 
you can get around that though I think
what<00:05:02.009> you<00:05:02.099> do<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.490> get<00:05:02.639> yourself<00:05:02.820> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
what you do is you get yourself a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.560 
what you do is you get yourself a
