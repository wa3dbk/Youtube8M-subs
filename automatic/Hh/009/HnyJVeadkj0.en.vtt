 If your elbow is sick and you visit a medical facility 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 In the hospital, a tennis elbow

 You can get a diagnosis of a face elbow. 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.150

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 Badminton players, and nowadays you're working on a computer pc 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:28.770
 So I also come to Penis Japan 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 A small partial rupture of the ligament surrounding the bone from the wrist to the elbow 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 Or inflammation. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.099
 Ah , this one shock has come so loud. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.619
 Shock 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:49.020
 We begin to show symptoms as we repeat slowly. 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:55.500
 When we look at our elbows, we have two rounded protrusions. 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:01.080
 If you look at this part of the yv , the two rounded protrusions of this wrist and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:05.429
 The muscles that move the fingers are connected and now the lease is connected 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.690
 The tennis elbow 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.690
 Oh, can I show you 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:23.070
 There are two protrusions on the second outside and a little inside, 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.990
 This site is the wrist and another that connects the muscle to move the fingers and the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.510
 Between these ligaments 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.810
 The penis elbow is an inflammatory urine of the ligament region . 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.630
 I can see that it causes 2 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.980
 The outer part of one side portion of the projected two private public in fact be the main cause 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.440
 I have a number. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:52.380
 Of course, the main symptom of the Tens Elbow is pain in the elbow area. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.560
 But the dampness is now an uncomfortable mania 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:01.080
 Slightly painful when pressed is almost an early symptom 2 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:07.140
 If you are getting worse and worse, you can drop a small object and drop it. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:12.810
 If you give it a little strength, it will cause a great deal of pain in your elbow. 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:17.690
 If this gets worse, in some cases, when you wash your hands in the morning, 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.690
 You can feel the pain of hope very much 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.440
 Especially in clinical practice, our housewives are the most painful women 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.870
 It is. 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:34.090
 The mothers often get a lot of pain when they twist their arms when they do laundry 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.180
 It is very difficult for those who work at housework because they are heavily lakes. 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.969
 Is one of 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:47.069
 The cause of the tennis elbow is because it is in use and, of course, 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:53.129
 It is correct to lift heavy objects or refrain from using them in the arms 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:59.040
 In the first inflammation of the initial stage of treatment, 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:05.219
 It is okay to reduce the amount of poultice in that case, 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:09.419
 If you have had more than one month or more, 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:15.389
 I'm giving you see hasyeoseo promotes circulation around this 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:21.090
 Once you do not use it, you can push it like a squad 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:25.490
 It will be very helpful if you fix it. 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:31.970
 As a medical treatment, 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:37.580
 The affected area in such large lesions that are not particularly important Gaga Acupuncture 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:41.449
 It's called a bee venom . 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:47.960
 You can have a bigger effect if you're examining a boner. 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:52.880
 If you do not normally have that elbow area in addition to this, 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.949
 Even if there is a problem with the upper muscles below, there is pain on the elbow side 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.430
 There is 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:04.099
 So direct inflammation on the elbow 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:09.590
 If you do not get any pain, 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:14.030
 Until the upper arms of the forearm muscles and shoulders are untied 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.210
 I need you to smooth the flow here, but the pen lo is almost neat 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.550
 I can see it being treated. 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:27.500
 The taste is easily damaged due to a ligament or muscle is extremely recurring once I do this, 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.060
 Once you have a problem , never use excessive force for at least several months. 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.520
 Please drink. 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:39.789
 And again, when you do exercises or lift heavy things that are not important 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.789
 Please do not forget to stretch it. 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.170
