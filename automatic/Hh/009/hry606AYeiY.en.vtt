00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.780

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.570
 for you 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.880
 this time we are going to make this water ice you 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.240
 story what eaten but super 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.340
 super nice and very very healthy and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.830
 only ingredients you need is 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.170
 water and fruit but I also know extra 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.660
 add ingredients such as grenadine 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.000
 and yes different types of fruit so yes 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.080
 if you let me know how to effect this water 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.080
 stay and watch twitter 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.650
 The first thing you need is one 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.629
 holder to make ice cream in the kia 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.610
 can be found there for 2 euros but on blocks 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.860
 casa and maybe even a man as 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.110
 sell similar holders 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.250
 am We need water what Bruijs 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.629
 does not matter 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 you actually have to floor it yourself 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.170
 tastiest 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.799
 additionally you still know families who are in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.799
 add juice 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.960
 we need fruit we use here 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.510
 strawberry grapes 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.650
 Persie kiwi and may even have a watermelon 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.300
 cut it up 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.300
 you prefer to use fresh fruit 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.910
 before we start where they we first 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.910
 our helmets 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.150
 start by washing and washing the fruit 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.810
 cut small pieces so that they are in the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.810
 fit the holder 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 you do grapes by the one that is really wrong 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.770
 super refreshing you can make one 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.770
 cut up watermelon 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.950
 put small pieces on the watermelon 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.489
 but you certainly do not have the peachez first 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.489
 to take out 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.590
 when it is all ready we can do the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.600
 hell it's ready mine mine 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.970
 come from super way and then 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 you start adding the pieces of fruit 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.270
 for example, you can order one type of fruit 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.470
 add holder 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.160
 but you can also do with different ones 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.160
 playing flavors 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.640
 in this I only put grapes in later 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640
 not yet feel special there 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.069
 then fill the containers that the trijntje with 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.930
 water I use water from this by the way 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.580
 the tap 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.680
 dude and the first lid on it and 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.569
 then put the earring stick I have 3 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 series you around that upstairs sink 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.900
 to do 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.480
 we still have that special one 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.550
 with only grapes 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.890
 here you add juice in the dinner 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.920
 pay attention to something that makes him call girl 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.920
 contains more sugar so I just asked 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.630
 water with a busy in the lisap 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.100
 the ratio is one in seven but me 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 actually always do it on sight 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.919
 and then see the freezer what time it is 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.919
 rest for a day 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.000
 you simply keep the holder warm 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.890
 water so you get the ash ' out of the holder 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.890
 can scroll like I do before 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:16.299
 as you can see the water is ice cream with 

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.189
 the grapes really well succeeded 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:20.879
 and that you can I promised from really whole 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.879
 tastes good 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:26.549
 I hope you enjoyed this, give it back 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:26.549
 bye
