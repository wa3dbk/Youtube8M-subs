00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.460 

so<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:27.320> backside<00:00:27.529> big<00:00:27.920> spin<00:00:28.269> is<00:00:29.269> a<00:00:29.480> 360<00:00:30.199> shuvit

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
do those things in order to do the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.930 
do those things in order to do the
backside<00:00:39.769> big<00:00:39.980> spin<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.220> think<00:00:40.519> that<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.730> just

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940

you<00:00:41.480> know<00:00:41.570> it's<00:00:41.720> one<00:00:41.930> motion<00:00:42.110> it's<00:00:42.949> a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
you know it's one motion it's a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.290 
you know it's one motion it's a
completely<00:00:43.400> different<00:00:43.579> motion<00:00:43.970> than<00:00:44.089> a<00:00:44.120> pop

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
completely different motion than a pop

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.680 
completely different motion than a pop
