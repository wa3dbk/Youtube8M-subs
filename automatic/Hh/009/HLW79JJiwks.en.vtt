probably<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.390> ever<00:01:51.630> designed<00:01:51.870> it's<00:01:52.260> all

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
probably was ever designed it's all

probably was ever designed it's all
disappearing<00:01:53.220> edges<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.600> later<00:01:54.810> when

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
disappearing edges a little later when

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.860 
disappearing edges a little later when
we<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.250> boat<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> water<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.480> it

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.810 
we have this boat on the water and it
turns<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.410> come<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.490> almost

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
turns to come at you it almost

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.000 
turns to come at you it almost
disappears<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.870> stealth<00:02:01.140> fighter<00:02:01.260> I'm

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
disappears like the stealth fighter I'm

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.920 
disappears like the stealth fighter I'm
sure<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.090> happened<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:04.490> was<00:02:05.490> some<00:02:05.930> that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
sure what happened here was some that

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.800 
sure what happened here was some that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
layout boat which is about this load of

layout boat which is about this load of
the<00:02:11.819> water<00:02:12.060> has<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> bigger<00:02:12.750> profile<00:02:13.379> almost

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the water has a bigger profile almost

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.970 
the water has a bigger profile almost
like<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> pumpkin<00:02:14.700> seed<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.739> he<00:02:16.739> had<00:02:16.860> his

decoys<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> bunch<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> birds<00:02:18.330> probably

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
decoys out and a bunch of birds probably

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.680 
decoys out and a bunch of birds probably
landed<00:02:19.170> down<00:02:19.379> beyond<00:02:19.860> them<00:02:20.099> out<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> gun

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
landed down beyond them out a gun

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.650 
landed down beyond them out a gun
and<00:02:22.380> he<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.280> waning<00:02:23.790> light<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.510> end

and he is the waning light and the end

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.120 
and he is the waning light and the end
of<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.840> day<00:02:24.990> was<00:02:25.200> approached<00:02:25.560> he<00:02:25.770> said<00:02:25.950> how

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
of the day was approached he said how

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.700 
of the day was approached he said how
can<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.550> at<00:02:26.640> those<00:02:26.790> birds<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:28.320> he<00:02:28.440> probably

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
can I get at those birds so he probably

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.790

was<00:02:40.320> first<00:02:41.040> came<00:02:41.250> about<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:42.600> engineering<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
was first came about the engineering and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.630 
was first came about the engineering and
the<00:02:44.250> thought<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.850> has<00:02:45.840> gone<00:02:46.080> into<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.710> it's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the thought that has gone into this it's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.060 
the thought that has gone into this it's
pretty<00:02:47.940> significant<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.470> boat<00:02:49.740> has<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
Merrimack River watershed this boat is

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.370 
Merrimack River watershed this boat is
really<00:02:56.160> found<00:02:56.730> no<00:02:57.240> other<00:02:57.450> place<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.170> this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
really found no other place in this
