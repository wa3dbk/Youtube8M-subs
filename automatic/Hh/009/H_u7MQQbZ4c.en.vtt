together<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.759> kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.090> becomes<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.659> little

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
together it kind of becomes a little

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
together it kind of becomes a little
thicker<00:01:43.200> than<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.649> started<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
thicker than we started with I like to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
thicker than we started with I like to
keep<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.720> starter<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.939> little<00:01:47.939> bit<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299

keep my starter a little bit on the
thick<00:01:48.540> side<00:01:48.860> rather<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.490> thin<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
thick side rather than a thin and it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
thick side rather than a thin and it
actually<00:01:51.930> becomes<00:01:52.460> if<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.180> my

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
actually becomes if you can see my

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.889 
actually becomes if you can see my
starter<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> almost<00:01:55.680> Dobby<00:01:56.689> if<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
starter is kind of almost Dobby if you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.859 
starter is kind of almost Dobby if you
can<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> camera<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.240> it's

hydration<00:02:20.300> which<00:02:20.780> actually<00:02:20.990> means<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:22.240> feeding

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
hydration which actually means a feeding

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.610 
hydration which actually means a feeding
starter<00:02:23.780> x<00:02:23.959> equal<00:02:24.440> amount<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.160> flour<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
water measuring it by weight rather than

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.620 
water measuring it by weight rather than
by<00:02:30.830> volume<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.420> forth<00:02:32.690> I'm<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.830> know

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
by volume and so forth I'm just you know

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.330 
by volume and so forth I'm just you know
trying<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.750> keep<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> consistency<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:37.040> like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
trying to keep the consistency I like

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.150 
trying to keep the consistency I like
and<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:37.940> working<00:02:38.450> well<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:38.989> me<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.470> I'm

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and it's working well for me so I'm

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.960 
and it's working well for me so I'm
gonna<00:02:40.400> feed<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.880> starter<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:42.459> my<00:02:43.459> next<00:02:43.820> video

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
gonna feed the starter and my next video

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.199 
gonna feed the starter and my next video
I<00:02:44.450> will<00:02:44.890> take<00:02:45.890> time<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.340> explain<00:02:46.700> what<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.090> do

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
I will take time to explain what to do

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.510 
I will take time to explain what to do
with<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.450> starter<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.310> unless<00:02:49.310> you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
with the starter because unless you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.020 
with the starter because unless you
baking<00:02:49.940> bread<00:02:50.270> every<00:02:50.720> day<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:52.400> probably<00:02:52.640> want

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
baking bread every day you probably want

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.340 
baking bread every day you probably want
to<00:02:53.150> store<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.570> starter<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.140> fridge

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
to store the starter in the fridge

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.550 
to store the starter in the fridge
refrigerator<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:56.720> going<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.140> explain<00:02:57.500> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
refrigerator so I'm going to explain to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.590 
refrigerator so I'm going to explain to
you<00:02:57.830> how<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.160> do<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.820> maybe<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.420> following

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
you how to do it and maybe the following

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.759 
you how to do it and maybe the following
video<00:03:00.010> where<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.100> will<00:03:01.280> make<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:02.560> loaf<00:03:03.560> of

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
video where you will make a loaf of

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.710 
video where you will make a loaf of
sourdough<00:03:04.070> bread<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.180> at<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:05.450> point

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
sourdough bread but at this point

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.050 
sourdough bread but at this point
actually<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:06.830> point<00:03:06.920> once<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.670> mixed

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
actually at this point once you mixed

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
actually at this point once you mixed
the<00:03:08.620> feed<00:03:09.620> fitted<00:03:10.299> with<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.780> know<00:03:11.900> with

the feed fitted with a you know with
whatever<00:03:12.260> flavor<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:12.830> like<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.570> safely

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
whatever flavor you like you can safely

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.520 
whatever flavor you like you can safely
put<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.470> starter<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.920> refrigerator<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.530> from

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
put the starter in refrigerator and from

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.560 
put the starter in refrigerator and from
now<00:03:18.680> if<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.010> keep<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.489> refrigerator<00:03:19.670> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
now if you keep it in refrigerator you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.610 
now if you keep it in refrigerator you
should<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.590> feeding<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.160> once<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:23.150> week<00:03:23.620> usually

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
should be feeding it once a week usually
