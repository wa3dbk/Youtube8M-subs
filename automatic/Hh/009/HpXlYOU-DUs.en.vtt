00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 well these are the written face 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.230
 I hope you are more point and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.819
 welcome to what is a game 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.040
 extremely fast there is no time nor 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.420
 for presentations please I'm with 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 I aninos that we are seeing now 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.530
 same on our screens 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.260
 good you are seeing a trend with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 street of 12 with the shotgun with a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 Good shotgun I do not know if it's good or bad 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.650
 I use it a lot of others is a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 colleague who collaborates with the channel and the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 truth is that I have games like this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.910
 in the channel that you are going to be able to see in nothing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.769
 like a love with the ap-9 double more 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 clear and very good the truth is that it is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.899
 One last and you also told me 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.290
 before in private that a little bit of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.040
 fifa 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.390
 but little if good goes up more bug than 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.210
 it's also from the channel is the other person 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.489
 that goes up most especially tips 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 last and chemicals so well I think 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.590
 that there are few people on youtube or so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.140
 famous that climb fit and I think that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 I like the fifa a lot, I get more expensive 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.289
 this kind of the truth is that is what 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.520
 I like it more, it's what he likes the most 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 Most people who played 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.540
 video games and things like that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.769
 and what people do not know is that if you 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.130
 you're listening a little bit wrong it's because 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.320
 you're under a mailbox and well it's my turn 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.450
 hear me from my house I'm here from 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 vacation on the beach and well it's my turn 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.520
 go from my house looking for wifi by the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 community and I had to go to the bar and then 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.640
 no but I have to go under a few 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.229
 mailboxes here hiding so you do not know 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.670
 note a lot the air and see if it pulls better 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.250
 wifi thing you're with a laptop 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.160
 under a mailbox 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.080
 but as you are seeing it, people do not 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.240
 is with a laptop under 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580
 fucking inclusions in the lumbar under his 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 everything very surreal and good house 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.750
 we are in demolition not because in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.180
 demolition your colleague and not in domain the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.979
 another game mode because good the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.250
 truth is that in demolition it gives a lot 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.740
 time to things that is the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 first bike and good gives you more time to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 try the second me the truth is that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.090
 I'm looking for the second but I have not yet 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.460
 I had the used hand because that's how I'm left 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.050
 many times close but never reaches 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.510
 get because I do not know it costs me a lot 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.150
 I always end up 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.310
 why two assassins like this always 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.390
 they end up tapping so how good I am 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.980
 trying and good this kid in the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.960
 channel we have mode type games with the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.040
 ap-9 double mouse and almost everything in 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.380
 demolition by the abras which is what 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.200
 he likes it more and like you're 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.270
 saying two earn us well then in 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 I actually created the channel in the beginning 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.130
 was going to be 10 in 10 people yes good 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.590
 but see you later 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.820
 but it 's friends were relaxing and at 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.950
 final there is a time I said a lot and I know 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.810
 I said to a colleague who also liked 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.280
 many video games so good bug 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.640
 which also channel if ye who pass by 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.150
 channel to see many duals so what 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.410
 more we like to do and well then to 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.210
 we finished and he and I bought a 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.040
 capturing stockings and good now let's 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.350
 buy the second one because we feel like it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.760
 enough already to have each one to our 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.470
 ball not having that was asking the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.010
 once in a while that has to go home 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.420
 the other is a pain in the ass so good and 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 from what I'm seeing in the game is 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.160
 as epic not in some moments there 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 with the screen in red with butt 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.209
 a specialist 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.549
 really not half fast and half 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.560
 pretty good because between minutitos not 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.209
 it's not bad I think if the truth is that 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.340
 it happened to me when I saw it I stayed 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.140
 flipping is a fad with the shotgun 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.090
 with the shotgun I value much more because 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.849
 they do not have distance and the truth is that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.709
 I do not know I do not know how to use the patient once 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.950
 in when the 99 is removed but times 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.480
 counted that is with just was clear 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.430
 if it's going to get a little bit far 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.500
 Well, if it's impossible, I will not 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.920
 I know how to use the complete ones as I said and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920
 good 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.880
 the game is ending and this is already 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.020
 he also tried the second one and as you will see 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.120
 the expression is different because 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.300
 seems to cut tried the second but 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.560
 nothing did not come out and well then that because nothing 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.090
 kids, I hope you liked a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.440
 I salute and until next time come 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.440
 see you later goodbye
