00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.450
 little tutorial how to hook up his 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.250

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
 these are the same branches so you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.869
 show the original hooks because 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.829
 that it must give that in the end so 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.100
 really will reduce that so basically 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.860
 you have a branch like that one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.370
 do it like this is the red and the white 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:54.289
 you remove the two you plug the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.289

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.989

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.490
 unplugged at the very beginning here you plug 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.750
 the red and you just plug in the white 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.200
