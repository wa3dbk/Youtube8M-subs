to get them shipped out here to
Australia<00:01:18.259> um<00:01:19.520> why<00:01:20.520> went<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.090> these<00:01:21.240> struts

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
Australia um why went for these struts

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
Australia um why went for these struts
is<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> look<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> side<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:26.299> these

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
is if you look on the side of them these

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
is if you look on the side of them these
particular<00:01:27.689> struts<00:01:28.259> came<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.540> 2<00:01:30.540> 1<00:01:31.009> mm

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
particular struts came with 2 1 mm

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.200 
particular struts came with 2 1 mm
Newton<00:01:33.079> force<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.500> each<00:01:35.100> strut<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.880> fully

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
Newton force in each strut they fully

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
Newton force in each strut they fully
gas<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> maximum<00:01:37.710> limit<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
gas to the maximum limit but what you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.190 
gas to the maximum limit but what you
can<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:42.920> putting<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.130> allen<00:01:44.430> key<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
can do is putting an allen key in this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.889 
can do is putting an allen key in this
this<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.560> hole<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.360> twist<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
this little hole here you can twist it

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.130 
this little hole here you can twist it
and<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.290> release<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.950> gas<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.960> could

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and just release the gas and you could

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.469 
and just release the gas and you could
get<00:01:52.290> someone<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> other<00:01:53.280> side<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.180> release

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
get someone on the other side to release

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.170 
get someone on the other side to release
the<00:01:54.659> gas<00:01:55.969> at<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> same<00:01:57.329> time<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.250> release

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the gas at the same time you can release

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260 
the gas at the same time you can release
a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.600> bit<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> gas<00:02:01.020> push<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:02.090> see<00:02:03.090> how

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
a little bit of gas push it down see how

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
a little bit of gas push it down see how
it<00:02:03.420> goes<00:02:03.630> release<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.710> gas<00:02:04.950> until<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it goes release a bit more gas until you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.450 
it goes release a bit more gas until you
get<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.710> adjusted<00:02:07.710> correctly

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
get it adjusted correctly

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.710 
get it adjusted correctly
the<00:02:10.030> way<00:02:10.830> I've<00:02:11.830> designed<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.060> geometry<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the way I've designed the geometry the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.360 
the way I've designed the geometry the
mechanism<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:20.350> easy<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.950> lift

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
mechanism is so that it's easy to lift

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.430 
mechanism is so that it's easy to lift
up<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.600> won't<00:02:22.840> blow<00:02:23.290> over<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.120> wind

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
up but it won't blow over in the wind

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.890 
up but it won't blow over in the wind
and<00:02:26.440> kids<00:02:27.250> can't<00:02:27.580> really<00:02:27.910> push<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> over<00:02:28.690> but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and kids can't really push it over but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.940 
and kids can't really push it over but
an<00:02:29.140> adult<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.730> come<00:02:33.940> down<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.540> side

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
