think<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.870> look<00:02:15.959> pretty<00:02:16.019> small<00:02:17.989> there's

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
think it would look pretty small there's

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.110 
think it would look pretty small there's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
green but it makes it really brighter in

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.510

alright<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.760> don't<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.209> go<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.540> tires

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
alright I don't really go with tires

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.210 
alright I don't really go with tires
like<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.230> they're<00:03:55.409> not<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> greatest<00:03:55.680> ties

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
like that they're not the greatest ties

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.039 
like that they're not the greatest ties
but<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.090> want<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> try<00:03:57.480> different<00:03:57.720> tires

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
but I just want to try different tires

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.349 
but I just want to try different tires
on<00:03:58.319> different<00:03:58.620> cars<00:03:58.829> because<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.579> tend<00:04:00.299> to

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
on different cars because I tend to

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.780 
on different cars because I tend to
overuse<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.900> tires<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.379> little<00:04:01.650> bit<00:04:01.829> but<00:04:02.639> there

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
overuse the tires a little bit but there

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.129 
overuse the tires a little bit but there
is<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.780> Ocelot<00:04:04.530> f6<00:04:05.099> 20<00:04:05.900> not<00:04:06.900> really<00:04:07.109> a

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
is that is the Ocelot f6 20 not really a

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.960 
is that is the Ocelot f6 20 not really a
lot<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.379> mild<00:04:07.560> Shana<00:04:07.829> went<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.099> spoilage<00:04:08.700> him

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
lot of mild Shana went a spoilage him

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.729 
lot of mild Shana went a spoilage him
can't<00:04:09.420> change<00:04:09.659> 20<00:04:10.019> exhausts<00:04:10.409> that<00:04:10.440> would<00:04:10.620> look

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
can't change 20 exhausts that would look

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.640 
can't change 20 exhausts that would look
even<00:04:10.829> better<00:04:10.980> on<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.430> car<00:04:11.989> from<00:04:12.989> bompa<00:04:13.470> but

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
even better on this car from bompa but

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.780 
even better on this car from bompa but
then<00:04:13.739> again<00:04:13.950> you've<00:04:14.099> got<00:04:14.129> that<00:04:14.220> big<00:04:14.489> grill

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
then again you've got that big grill

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
then again you've got that big grill
with<00:04:15.000> maybe<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.540> little<00:04:15.780> lip<00:04:15.959> with<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.620> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
with maybe a little lip with it on it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.479 
with maybe a little lip with it on it
it's<00:04:18.810> already<00:04:19.109> got<00:04:19.229> vented<00:04:19.590> hood<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.099> that's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it's already got vented hood so that's

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.860 
it's already got vented hood so that's
most<00:04:20.940> probably<00:04:21.180> why<00:04:21.269> they<00:04:21.419> didn't<00:04:21.599> add<00:04:21.720> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
most probably why they didn't add that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.589 
most probably why they didn't add that
in<00:04:22.049> but<00:04:22.229> spoiler<00:04:22.470> exhaust<00:04:23.099> and<00:04:23.430> rear<00:04:24.360> and

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
in but spoiler exhaust and rear and

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.170 
in but spoiler exhaust and rear and
front<00:04:24.660> bumpers<00:04:25.260> are<00:04:25.949> a<00:04:26.010> must<00:04:26.729> for<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:26.970> guy

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
front bumpers are a must for this guy

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.180 
front bumpers are a must for this guy
really<00:04:27.539> needed<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.970> there<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:31.190> get

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
really needed that but there is the get

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.610 
really needed that but there is the get
out<00:04:32.340> busy<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:32.940> see<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.240> colour<00:04:33.479> camera<00:04:34.440> zoom

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
out busy and see the colour camera zoom

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.760 
out busy and see the colour camera zoom
out

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.300 

there<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.730> Ocelot<00:04:43.210> f6<00:04:43.630> 20<00:04:44.110> he<00:04:45.070> went<00:04:45.220> into

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
there is the Ocelot f6 20 he went into

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.310 
there is the Ocelot f6 20 he went into
the<00:04:45.460> wall<00:04:45.640> then<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:46.090> started<00:04:46.750> doing<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.050> last

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
the wall then I started doing this last

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.890 
the wall then I started doing this last
episode<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.950> never<00:04:48.220> used<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.970> cinema<00:04:49.360> camera

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
episode I never used the cinema camera

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.440 
episode I never used the cinema camera
when<00:04:50.050> I'm<00:04:50.170> doing<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.670> fully<00:04:51.670> modded<00:04:52.060> which<00:04:52.240> I

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
when I'm doing a fully modded which I

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.680 
when I'm doing a fully modded which I
probably<00:04:52.930> should<00:04:53.380> because<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:54.940> get<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.510> know

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
probably should because you get you know

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.690 
probably should because you get you know
