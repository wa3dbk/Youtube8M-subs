much any coastline I like this location

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.340 
much any coastline I like this location
because<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.869> really<00:00:30.869> easy<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
because it's really easy to get to and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.200 
because it's really easy to get to and
second<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.800> easy<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> early

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
second of all it's easy to get to early

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
second of all it's easy to get to early
in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> game<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.670> just<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:39.000> down<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> hill

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in the game so just go down this hill

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.290 
in the game so just go down this hill
and<00:00:41.329> crash<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.600> far<00:00:42.960> into<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> water<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
and crash this far into the water and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
and crash this far into the water and
now<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> couple<00:00:45.719> tips<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.289> how<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> kill

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now I have a couple tips on how to kill

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
now I have a couple tips on how to kill
a<00:00:47.399> shark<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> people

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
a shark because I know a lot of people

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
a shark because I know a lot of people
find<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.520> quite<00:00:50.789> difficult

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
find this quite difficult

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.950 
find this quite difficult
the<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:52.739> method<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.520> call<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> Steve<00:00:54.510> Irwin

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the first method I call the Steve Irwin

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
the first method I call the Steve Irwin
it's<00:00:55.530> probably<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.160> basic<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.910> swim<00:00:57.210> up

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's probably the most basic you swim up

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's probably the most basic you swim up
to<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> shark<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.260> stab<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> shit<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.520> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to a shark and stab the shit out of it I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
to a shark and stab the shit out of it I
don't<00:01:00.539> recommend<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> effective

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
don't recommend this it is effective

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
don't recommend this it is effective
because<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:03.120> guaranteed<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> kill<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> if

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
because you're guaranteed to kill it if

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.700 
because you're guaranteed to kill it if
you<00:01:04.619> succeed<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.810> multiple<00:01:07.380> sharks

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you succeed but multiple sharks

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
you succeed but multiple sharks
attacking<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:08.640> does<00:01:08.850> happen<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
attacking you which does happen you can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
attacking you which does happen you can
find<00:01:11.040> yourself<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.700> bad<00:01:11.880> situation

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
find yourself in a really bad situation

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.620 
find yourself in a really bad situation
and<00:01:12.990> who<00:01:13.860> wants<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> die<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.240> much

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and who wants to die there are much

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
and who wants to die there are much
safer<00:01:15.960> methods<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> doing<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.939> notice

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
safer methods of doing this and notice

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.990 
safer methods of doing this and notice
how<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> body<00:01:18.930> sinks<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> bottom<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.340> try

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
how the body sinks to the bottom so try

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
how the body sinks to the bottom so try
not<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> do<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.540> deep<00:01:21.900> water<00:01:25.100> okay

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
not to do this in deep water okay

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.719 
not to do this in deep water okay
next<00:01:26.460> method<00:01:26.630> shooting<00:01:27.630> fish<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.259> barrel<00:01:28.729> if

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
next method shooting fish in a barrel if

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.550 
next method shooting fish in a barrel if
you've<00:01:29.939> ever<00:01:30.090> seen<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.560> Mythbusters

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you've ever seen that Mythbusters

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
you've ever seen that Mythbusters
episode<00:01:32.189> where<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.610> shoot<00:01:32.689> guns<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.990> water

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
episode where they shoot guns of water

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.100 
episode where they shoot guns of water
and<00:01:34.759> larger<00:01:35.759> caliber<00:01:36.180> weapons<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:36.780> do

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and larger caliber weapons actually do

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.819 
and larger caliber weapons actually do
worse<00:01:37.470> than<00:01:37.890> smaller<00:01:38.820> caliber<00:01:39.329> weapons<00:01:39.829> yeah

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
worse than smaller caliber weapons yeah

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
worse than smaller caliber weapons yeah
farcry<00:01:41.340> does<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.729> care<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.299> logic<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
farcry does not care about that logic so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
farcry does not care about that logic so
with<00:01:43.860> regular<00:01:44.070> guns<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.759> cannot<00:01:45.000> shoot<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
with regular guns you cannot shoot it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.399 
with regular guns you cannot shoot it
sharks<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.320> bigger<00:01:47.189> weapons<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
sharks but with bigger weapons like a

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.050 
sharks but with bigger weapons like a
full-size<00:01:49.409> machine<00:01:49.619> gun<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.610> apparently

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
full-size machine gun you can apparently

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.840 
full-size machine gun you can apparently
just<00:01:51.210> destroy<00:01:51.840> sharks<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.710> go<00:01:53.549> ahead<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
just destroy sharks so go ahead and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
just destroy sharks so go ahead and
hijack<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> boat<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hijack a boat and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.870

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
runa shark with the machine gun and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.160 
runa shark with the machine gun and
again<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.149> sink<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> bottom<00:02:00.689> as

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
again it will sink to the bottom as

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
again it will sink to the bottom as
always<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:02.369> ahead<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> skin<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
always go ahead and skin it and that's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.110 
always go ahead and skin it and that's
how<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.929> kill<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:05.069> a<00:02:05.100> boat<00:02:10.879> okay<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.060> for

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
how you kill it with a boat okay now for

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.750 
how you kill it with a boat okay now for
my<00:02:12.690> favorite<00:02:13.170> method<00:02:13.530> which<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.549> high<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
my favorite method which is the high and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210 
my favorite method which is the high and
dry<00:02:15.440> standing<00:02:16.440> from<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> coast<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.190> can
