00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
bringing it up slams you have two pair

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
bringing it up slams you have two pair
of<00:00:20.939> boots<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.830> blue<00:00:23.070> boots

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of boots like this these are blue boots

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
of boots like this these are blue boots
and<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> newer<00:00:25.920> pair<00:00:26.340> they

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and this is actually the newer pair they

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
and this is actually the newer pair they
actually<00:00:27.029> could<00:00:27.210> use<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> bit<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> shine<00:00:28.070> as

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
actually could use a bit of a shine as

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.630 
actually could use a bit of a shine as
you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.400> tell<00:00:29.580> from<00:00:29.730> looking<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:30.500> but<00:00:31.640> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you can tell from looking at but the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.040 
you can tell from looking at but the
older<00:00:32.969> parent<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> show<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
older parent going to show you in a

older parent going to show you in a
second<00:00:35.210> maybe<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.890> overuse<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.250> probably

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
second maybe from overuse but probably

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.119 
second maybe from overuse but probably
more<00:00:38.850> likely<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:40.350> taking<00:00:40.739> care<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> them

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
more likely just not taking care of them

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.510 
more likely just not taking care of them
property<00:00:41.670> specifically<00:00:42.450> conditioning<00:00:43.200> them

property specifically conditioning them

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
property specifically conditioning them
means<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.850> kind<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> wrecked<00:00:45.510> compared

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
means they are kind of wrecked compared

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.709 
means they are kind of wrecked compared
to<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.710> ones<00:00:47.180> well<00:00:48.180> these<00:00:48.329> ones<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.690> can

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to these ones well these ones you can

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
to these ones well these ones you can
tell<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.140> coming<00:00:49.410> apart<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> sole

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
tell they're coming apart of the sole

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.880

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
do it yourself and if you use

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.620 
do it yourself and if you use
conditioner<00:01:05.480> or<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.200> saddle<00:01:06.530> soul<00:01:06.860> or<00:01:07.190> what

okay<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.110> these<00:01:09.230> are<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.440> new<00:01:09.590> ones<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.780> these

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
okay so these are the new ones and these

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.570 
okay so these are the new ones and these
are<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.220> older<00:01:13.580> ones<00:01:13.960> like<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:14.990> said<00:01:15.580> they're

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
are the older ones like I said they're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.370 
are the older ones like I said they're
bleh<00:01:17.030> style<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:19.090> here<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.300> probably<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
bleh style and here is probably the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.580 
bleh style and here is probably the
worst<00:01:21.560> example<00:01:22.190> of<00:01:22.220> what<00:01:22.460> can<00:01:22.580> happen<00:01:23.410> just<00:01:24.410> a

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
worst example of what can happen just a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.090 
worst example of what can happen just a
big<00:01:24.830> care<00:01:25.130> probably<00:01:25.670> we're<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.740> smaller<00:01:27.740> toes

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
big care probably we're a smaller toes

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
tell places where letters got squished

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.809 
tell places where letters got squished
in<00:01:43.539> where<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:43.840> foot<00:01:44.109> hangs<00:01:44.350> over<00:01:44.829> these<00:01:45.549> ones

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
in where the foot hangs over these ones

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.279 
in where the foot hangs over these ones
that<00:01:45.969> was<00:01:46.060> kind<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.270> mucking<00:01:46.659> about<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.170> other

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
that was kind of mucking about the other

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.539 
that was kind of mucking about the other
day<00:01:47.409> that's<00:01:47.530> where<00:01:47.710> they're<00:01:47.829> kind<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.100> muddy

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
day that's where they're kind of muddy

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.330 
day that's where they're kind of muddy
usually<00:01:48.939> I<00:01:48.969> clean<00:01:49.299> em<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.600> but<00:01:50.590> uh<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.950> got<00:01:51.249> to

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
usually I clean em up but uh I got to

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.209 
usually I clean em up but uh I got to
admit<00:01:51.429> sometimes<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.600> leave<00:01:52.750> them<00:01:52.899> around

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
admit sometimes I leave them around

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.219 
admit sometimes I leave them around
sitting<00:01:54.219> for<00:01:54.640> quite<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:55.659> while

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
sitting for quite a while

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.770 
sitting for quite a while
dirty<00:01:57.130> or<00:01:57.340> muddy<00:01:57.579> which<00:01:58.179> is<00:01:58.299> not<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.509> good<00:01:58.719> thing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
dirty or muddy which is not a good thing

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.809 
dirty or muddy which is not a good thing
because<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.259> dries<00:01:59.530> opal<00:01:59.890> leather<00:02:00.039> that's

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
because that dries opal leather that's

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.279 
because that dries opal leather that's
maybe<00:02:01.060> another<00:02:01.270> reason<00:02:01.630> why<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:01.780> craft

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
maybe another reason why this craft

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.139 
maybe another reason why this craft
probably<00:02:02.829> need<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.219> them<00:02:03.369> have<00:02:04.000> them

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
probably need to get them have them

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.219 
probably need to get them have them
clean<00:02:04.539> right<00:02:04.869> afterwards

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
clean right afterwards

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.119 
clean right afterwards
these<00:02:08.229> ones<00:02:08.440> looks<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.739> haven't<00:02:08.979> been

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
these ones looks like I haven't been

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.360 
these ones looks like I haven't been
resold<00:02:09.579> I<00:02:09.879> guess<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.349> overuse<00:02:12.129> because

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
resold I guess there is overuse because
