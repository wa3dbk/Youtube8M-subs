00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.660
 good that you live 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.880
 for 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.180
 at least to see that I could 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.300
 achieve using actually move the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.820
 2009 thing that they thought could not be 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.290
 and right now to the computer outside 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.619
 until the cables outside was doing 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.619
 a bit of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.150
 test 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.570
 for whom 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.570
 Computer 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.310
 teach something here 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.160
 on the map that you have chosen 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 do not feel it will be the first reality 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.020
 that has a double map but at least 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.890
 I did something here so they could see and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.890
 prove it 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:10.040
 right now the car is working in 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.040
 your normal map the map that everything 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.820
 everyone has 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.460
 can see the revolutions are 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 Still can see the guayabal 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.000
 this map was changed with simply 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.560
 leave the cruise control button 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 held down 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.020
 I'm going to press the button that the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.020
 control the second 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.540
 and there change the map if you can observe 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.350
 where did tarmac 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.509
 setting the bulb is I'm 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.119
 indicating that he was already using the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.530
 second map and realize the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.710
 revolutions as they came down 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.940
 and the bus clock because I purposely 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.380
 back the time to be able to show that 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.380
 using the other map really 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 and let's say the revolutions now 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.229
 only the control button should 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.229
 tight and go back to your original map 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.989
 and he went back to his original map 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.079
 I go back and press the cross button 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.799
 control and there he changed to his second map 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:24.379
 alternative map you can use it to 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.780
 live without octane 116 octane like 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.450
 you want and only change the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.989
 map with the touch of a button we return to 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.989
 change it 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 and there is the summa for example 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.220
 okay
