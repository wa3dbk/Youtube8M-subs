and<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:17.490> difference<00:01:17.850> between<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and the difference between this and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560 
and the difference between this and
other<00:01:18.780> stylus<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:20.340> got<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.820> much

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
other stylus is is that it's got a much

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260 
other stylus is is that it's got a much
thinner<00:01:22.530> tip<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> around

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
thinner tip on it I think this is around

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
thinner tip on it I think this is around
about<00:01:24.420> 6<00:01:24.840> millimeters<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.619> opposed<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.070> 8

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
about 6 millimeters as opposed to 8

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.099
