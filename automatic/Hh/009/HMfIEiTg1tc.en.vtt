thing<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.549> reason<00:02:02.820> I've<00:02:02.939> heard<00:02:03.090> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
thing and the reason I've heard that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
thing and the reason I've heard that
they're<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.479> 100%<00:02:03.600> decided<00:02:04.530> they're

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
they're not 100% decided they're

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.119 
they're not 100% decided they're
supposed<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.600> three-quarter<00:02:06.600> scale

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
supposed to be three-quarter scale

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
supposed to be three-quarter scale
reason<00:02:08.129> whether<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.369> not<00:02:08.459> full<00:02:09.360> scale<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
reason whether or not full scale is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.770 
reason whether or not full scale is
because<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.250> would<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.879> license

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because then they would have to license

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.490 
because then they would have to license
them

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
them

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.430 
them
as<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:14.250> official<00:02:14.730> Star<00:02:15.300> Trek<00:02:15.540> collectible<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
as an official Star Trek collectible and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.930 
as an official Star Trek collectible and
the<00:02:16.710> price<00:02:16.950> would<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> extremely

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the price would have to be extremely

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940 
the price would have to be extremely
high<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:19.350> you've<00:02:19.530> seen<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.860> with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
high on those like you've seen it with

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.450 
high on those like you've seen it with
master<00:02:20.160> replicas<00:02:21.740> that's<00:02:22.740> why<00:02:22.980> they're<00:02:23.250> so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
master replicas that's why they're so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.050 
master replicas that's why they're so
expensive

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
expensive

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.080 
expensive
is<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.750> they're<00:02:25.020> true<00:02:25.410> scale<00:02:26.090> that's

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
is because they're true scale that's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.600 
is because they're true scale that's
what<00:02:27.270> I've<00:02:27.360> heard<00:02:27.390> at<00:02:27.750> least<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:29.520> know

what I've heard at least I don't know

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
what I've heard at least I don't know

right here batteries go into that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.290 
right here batteries go into that
compartment<00:02:51.270> these<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:52.020> pins<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:53.300> connect

compartment these two pins here connect
from<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.470> activate<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.070> thing<00:02:56.370> with

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
from here to activate this thing with

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.360 
from here to activate this thing with
these<00:02:56.640> two<00:02:56.850> prongs<00:02:57.150> there<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:59.220> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
these two prongs there and then this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.010 
these two prongs there and then this
little<00:02:59.700> hole<00:02:59.970> down<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:01.340> an<00:03:02.340> overload

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
little hole down here is an overload

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.460 
little hole down here is an overload
I'll<00:03:04.020> show<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.260> guys<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.650> later<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:07.320> on

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I'll show you guys that later so it's on

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.890 
I'll show you guys that later so it's on
setting<00:03:07.800> 1<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.220> that's<00:03:08.280> off<00:03:08.550> change<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.690> 1

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
setting 1 and that's off change it up 1

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:34.460 
setting 1 and that's off change it up 1
degree<00:03:19.970> there's<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.090> second<00:03:21.450> degree<00:03:28.459> lost<00:03:33.470> but

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
degree there's a second degree lost but

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.930 
degree there's a second degree lost but
I<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.620> seen<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.860> lot<00:03:34.920> of<00:03:35.070> people<00:03:35.250> doing<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
I have seen a lot of people doing is the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.320 
I have seen a lot of people doing is the
light<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.360> here<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.570> red

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.699 

I've<00:03:39.629> seen<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> lot<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.050> people<00:03:40.200> taking<00:03:40.530> these

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
I've seen a lot of people taking these

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.290 
I've seen a lot of people taking these
apart<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.160> putting<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.550> blue<00:03:41.730> ones<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.150> there

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
apart and putting the blue ones in there

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.699 
apart and putting the blue ones in there
because<00:03:42.450> that's<00:03:42.660> what<00:03:42.780> they<00:03:42.870> use<00:03:43.170> most<00:03:43.500> in

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
because that's what they use most in

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
because that's what they use most in
this<00:03:43.769> show<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.180> pretty<00:03:45.420> good

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
this show I think that's a pretty good

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.759 
this show I think that's a pretty good
idea<00:03:45.989> but<00:03:47.599> these<00:03:48.599> things<00:03:48.720> are<00:03:48.930> pretty<00:03:49.080> pretty

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
idea but these things are pretty pretty

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.470 
idea but these things are pretty pretty
small<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.220> pretty<00:03:50.459> fragile<00:03:50.700> I've<00:03:51.000> taken<00:03:51.239> one

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
small and pretty fragile I've taken one

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.630 
small and pretty fragile I've taken one
of<00:03:51.569> these<00:03:51.690> these<00:03:52.050> things<00:03:52.290> apart<00:03:52.620> that's<00:03:53.370> kind

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
of these these things apart that's kind

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.550 
of these these things apart that's kind
of<00:03:53.670> hard<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:53.910> do<00:03:54.060> do<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:55.200> own<00:03:55.349> risk

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
of hard to do do it with your own risk

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.589 
of hard to do do it with your own risk
you<00:03:55.739> could<00:03:55.890> find<00:03:56.160> videos<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.239> how<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.360> do<00:03:57.480> that

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
you could find videos on how to do that

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.790 
you could find videos on how to do that
on<00:03:57.780> YouTube<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.380> all<00:03:58.470> over<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.769> internet

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
on YouTube and all over the internet

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.520 
on YouTube and all over the internet
just<00:03:59.280> google<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.760> whatnot

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
just google it whatnot

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.990 
just google it whatnot
so<00:04:01.880> then<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.269> fits<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.900> here<00:04:04.730> like<00:04:05.730> that

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
so then this just fits in here like that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.080 
so then this just fits in here like that
and<00:04:06.349> you<00:04:07.349> have<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.650> pull<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.160> pin<00:04:08.489> out<00:04:08.519> to

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
and you have to pull this pin out to

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.319 
and you have to pull this pin out to
release<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:14.220> this<00:04:14.370> goes<00:04:14.580> in<00:04:14.730> here<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:17.329> this

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
release it so this goes in here and this

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.199 
release it so this goes in here and this
you<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.959> switch<00:04:19.229> once<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.850> keep<00:04:21.030> this

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
you just switch once and you keep this

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.480 
you just switch once and you keep this
on<00:04:21.450> your<00:04:21.540> settings<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.070> know<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.340> one

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
on your settings so you know this one

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.629 
on your settings so you know this one
whatever<00:04:23.669> setting<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.270> want

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
whatever setting you want

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:36.500 
whatever setting you want
shh-shh<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:27.139> then<00:04:28.139> twist<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.240> there's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
shh-shh and then twist this so there's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.890 
shh-shh and then twist this so there's
an<00:04:36.630> overload<00:04:37.080> for<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:38.270> here's<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.330> trigger

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
an overload for you here's the trigger

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.070 
an overload for you here's the trigger
for<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.760> switch<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.810> turn

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
for it and this is the switch to turn

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.180 
for it and this is the switch to turn
off<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.820> MIDI<00:04:45.180> right<00:04:45.450> here<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:49.190> this

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
off and on the MIDI right here and this

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.170 
off and on the MIDI right here and this
turns<00:04:50.970> my<00:04:51.479> surprise<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:53.370> actually<00:04:53.700> dims<00:04:54.030> the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
turns my surprise it actually dims the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:04.310 
turns my surprise it actually dims the
light<00:04:54.479> on<00:04:54.660> here

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.719 

that's<00:05:05.320> something<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.889> master

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
that's something that the master

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.280 
that's something that the master
replicas<00:05:07.150> phasers<00:05:07.690> apparently<00:05:08.139> had<00:05:08.260> a

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
replicas phasers apparently had a

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.810 
replicas phasers apparently had a
problem<00:05:08.650> with<00:05:08.949> as<00:05:09.130> these<00:05:09.340> things<00:05:09.580> would<00:05:09.729> be

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
problem with as these things would be

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.150 
problem with as these things would be
stuck<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:11.169> weren't<00:05:11.410> able<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.770> use<00:05:11.979> them

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
stuck and you weren't able to use them

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:23.629 
stuck and you weren't able to use them
and<00:05:12.430> they<00:05:12.550> had<00:05:12.699> to<00:05:12.729> recall<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.180> lot<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.570> them<00:05:14.400> I

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.950 

personally<00:05:24.639> think<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.970> would<00:05:25.180> buy<00:05:25.389> another<00:05:25.720> one

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
personally think I would buy another one

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.460 
personally think I would buy another one
of<00:05:26.080> these<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.610> refit<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.699> with<00:05:27.850> some<00:05:28.180> LEDs<00:05:29.139> to

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
of these and refit it with some LEDs to

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.200 
of these and refit it with some LEDs to
make<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.740> blue<00:05:29.979> maybe<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.790> looks<00:05:30.910> a<00:05:31.090> lot

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
make it blue maybe that looks a lot

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:39.360 
make it blue maybe that looks a lot
better<00:05:31.270> than<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.900> red<00:05:37.800> but<00:05:38.800> all<00:05:38.919> in<00:05:39.100> all<00:05:39.220> this

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
better than the red but all in all this

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.980 
better than the red but all in all this
is<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.580> really<00:05:39.850> really<00:05:39.970> good<00:05:40.210> product<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.870> have

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
is a really really good product to have

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.120 
is a really really good product to have
and<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:44.080> good<00:05:44.199> thing<00:05:44.380> about<00:05:44.470> this<00:05:44.740> is<00:05:44.949> the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
and the good thing about this is the

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.400 
and the good thing about this is the
phasers<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:46.120> phaser<00:05:46.510> one<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.169> only<00:05:47.289> thing

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
phasers the phaser one is the only thing

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.439 
phasers the phaser one is the only thing
that<00:05:47.560> breaks<00:05:47.830> on<00:05:48.070> them<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:48.880> I<00:05:48.910> do<00:05:49.060> have<00:05:49.240> my

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
that breaks on them so I do have my

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.860 
that breaks on them so I do have my
black<00:05:49.660> handle<00:05:50.110> phaser<00:05:50.350> but<00:05:51.280> I<00:05:51.370> can<00:05:51.610> easily<00:05:52.510> do

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
black handle phaser but I can easily do

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.020 
black handle phaser but I can easily do
is<00:05:53.139> just<00:05:53.610> swap<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.820> like<00:05:54.970> that<00:05:56.910> because<00:05:57.910> the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
is just swap it like that because the

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.629 
is just swap it like that because the
black<00:05:58.210> handle<00:05:58.660> is<00:05:58.900> a<00:05:59.020> lot<00:05:59.350> nicer<00:05:59.520> than<00:06:00.520> the

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
black handle is a lot nicer than the

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.570 
black handle is a lot nicer than the
bronze<00:06:00.820> handle<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.419> my<00:06:01.539> opinion<00:06:02.280> this<00:06:03.280> is<00:06:03.400> my

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
bronze handle in my opinion this is my

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.000 
bronze handle in my opinion this is my
review<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.410> showing<00:06:05.410> you<00:06:05.500> guys<00:06:05.620> how<00:06:05.680> these

review and showing you guys how these

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.529 
review and showing you guys how these
phasers<00:06:06.430> working<00:06:06.789> stuff<00:06:07.060> I<00:06:07.210> know<00:06:07.330> these<00:06:07.510> have

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
phasers working stuff I know these have

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.990 
phasers working stuff I know these have
been<00:06:07.840> hour<00:06:08.020> around<00:06:08.590> on<00:06:08.740> YouTube<00:06:09.099> I<00:06:09.370> thought

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
been hour around on YouTube I thought

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.640 
been hour around on YouTube I thought
I'd<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:10.389> thought<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.840> would<00:06:10.990> do<00:06:11.110> an<00:06:11.200> audio<00:06:11.349> one

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
I'd I thought I would do an audio one

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.719 
I'd I thought I would do an audio one

the<00:06:23.139> white<00:06:23.320> handle<00:06:23.620> phaser<00:06:23.889> and<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.310> bronze

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
the white handle phaser and the bronze

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.010 
the white handle phaser and the bronze
handle<00:06:24.940> phasers<00:06:25.240> are<00:06:25.300> probably<00:06:25.599> the<00:06:25.690> hardest

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
handle phasers are probably the hardest

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.520 
handle phasers are probably the hardest
wants<00:06:26.229> to<00:06:26.320> find<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:27.810> think<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:29.020> white<00:06:29.229> handle

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
wants to find I think the white handle

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.379 
wants to find I think the white handle
is<00:06:29.650> probably<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.430> most<00:06:30.639> rare<00:06:30.910> out<00:06:31.090> of<00:06:31.120> all<00:06:31.360> of

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
is probably the most rare out of all of

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.700 
is probably the most rare out of all of
three<00:06:33.510> since<00:06:34.510> this<00:06:34.780> bronze<00:06:35.050> handle<00:06:35.470> phaser

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
three since this bronze handle phaser

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.730 
three since this bronze handle phaser
came<00:06:36.070> out<00:06:36.220> they've<00:06:36.430> started<00:06:36.669> making<00:06:37.120> more

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
came out they've started making more

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.320 
came out they've started making more
different<00:06:38.740> variations<00:06:39.370> of<00:06:39.580> them<00:06:39.760> they've

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
different variations of them they've

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.240 
different variations of them they've
redone<00:06:40.780> the<00:06:40.960> white<00:06:41.139> handle<00:06:41.470> phaser<00:06:41.740> but<00:06:42.070> it's

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
redone the white handle phaser but it's

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.200 
redone the white handle phaser but it's
just<00:06:42.400> it's<00:06:42.760> just<00:06:43.000> this<00:06:43.180> painted<00:06:43.720> white<00:06:43.990> it's

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
just it's just this painted white it's

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.710 
just it's just this painted white it's
