00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.299 
how you can get all the colors that you
need<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.829> little<00:00:43.829> black<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
need we also have a little black and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.830 
need we also have a little black and
white<00:00:44.520> drawing<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> did<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
white drawing here that I did with the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
white drawing here that I did with the
prismacolor<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> permanent<00:00:47.550> marker<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
prismacolor it's a permanent marker so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.880 
prismacolor it's a permanent marker so
that<00:00:48.300> when<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> water<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
that when you put the water on it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.779 
that when you put the water on it
doesn't<00:00:50.520> run<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.930> gives<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> nice

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
doesn't run so it also gives a nice

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.150 
doesn't run so it also gives a nice
finished<00:00:53.789> look<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.329> picture<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:54.930> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
over it with this permanent marker you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
over it with this permanent marker you
can<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> sharpie<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.070> whatever<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.789> doesn't

can<00:02:09.509> add<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:10.170> bit<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.500> red<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.710> if<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
can add a little bit of red and if you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.250 
can add a little bit of red and if you
want<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> little<00:02:12.780> more<00:02:12.959> fall

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
want them to be a little more fall

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.690 
want them to be a little more fall
looking<00:02:13.620> or<00:02:13.740> whatever<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.340> add

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
looking or whatever you can just add

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.230 
looking or whatever you can just add
some<00:02:15.530> yellow<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.220> by<00:02:17.340> using<00:02:17.580> all<00:02:17.940> three

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
some yellow but by using all three

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.010 
some yellow but by using all three
colors<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.959> achieve<00:02:19.050> an<00:02:19.440> entire

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
colors you can achieve an entire

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.510 
colors you can achieve an entire
spectrum<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.320> color<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.920> good<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
spectrum of color and it's good it's a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.040 
spectrum of color and it's good it's a
good<00:02:23.640> practice<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.330> kids<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.810> learn

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
good practice for your kids to learn

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320 
good practice for your kids to learn
color<00:02:25.650> mixing<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.880> makes<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
color mixing and it just makes the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.270 
color mixing and it just makes the
nature<00:02:27.630> general<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.800> much<00:02:29.040> more

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
nature general that much more

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.660 
nature general that much more
interesting<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.970> fun<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> these<00:02:31.500> these<00:02:32.400> are

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
interesting and fun so these these are

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.550 
interesting and fun so these these are

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
color to their nature journal and if I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.010 
color to their nature journal and if I
were<00:02:37.140> actually<00:02:37.380> gonna<00:02:37.860> use<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.810> journal<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
were actually gonna use my journal I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.930 
were actually gonna use my journal I
would<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:40.890> while<00:02:41.220> it's<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.520> wet<00:02:41.760> I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
would not do this while it's all wet I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.729 
would not do this while it's all wet I
would<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.420> one<00:02:42.630> color<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.170> then<00:02:43.290> let<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.530> dry

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
would do one color and then let it dry

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.370 
would do one color and then let it dry
and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.820> add<00:02:45.060> more<00:02:45.330> color<00:02:45.630> on<00:02:45.870> top<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.260> it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then add more color on top of it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.490 
and then add more color on top of it
because<00:02:46.650> it'll<00:02:47.010> run<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.810> as<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.350> can

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
because it'll run like this as you can

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.350 
because it'll run like this as you can
see<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.770> get<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.160> bit<00:02:50.280> more<00:02:50.459> detail<00:02:50.880> if

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
see you get a little bit more detail if

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.580 
see you get a little bit more detail if
you<00:02:52.020> don't<00:02:52.520> do<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.550> while<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:53.940> still<00:02:54.030> wet<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you don't do it while it's still wet so

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.280 
you don't do it while it's still wet so
let<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> dry<00:02:55.890> between<00:02:56.040> colors<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.050> these<00:02:58.050> are

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
let it dry between colors but these are

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170 
let it dry between colors but these are
three<00:02:58.590> great<00:02:58.800> colors<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.430> start<00:02:59.820> with<00:03:00.000> your
