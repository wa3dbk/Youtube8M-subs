that's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:45.659> bold<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.350> me<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> say

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that's a very bold thing for me to say

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
that's a very bold thing for me to say
and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.399> agree<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.090> very<00:01:48.180> bold<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.750> say

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and I do agree it's very bold to say

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.560 
and I do agree it's very bold to say
it's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.350> crime<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.490> card<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.299> played

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's a crime for a card not to be played

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.649 
it's a crime for a card not to be played
in<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.990> certain<00:01:52.020> bills<00:01:52.549> but<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.880> feel<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
in a certain bills but I feel that this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
in a certain bills but I feel that this
car<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.680> hurt<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> matter<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.670> we

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
car can really hurt the matter if we

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.190 
car can really hurt the matter if we
look<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> decks<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.840> are<00:01:57.930> gonna<00:01:58.020> be

the graveyard the discard effects I mean

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.040 
the graveyard the discard effects I mean

now<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.840> might<00:02:24.020> be<00:02:24.170> thinking<00:02:24.530> well

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
now I know you might be thinking well

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.170 
now I know you might be thinking well
hold<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> second<00:02:25.459> if<00:02:25.580> call<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:25.970> gets

hold on a second if call for gets

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.630 
hold on a second if call for gets
special<00:02:26.360> summons<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.680> gets<00:02:27.860> negated<00:02:28.130> then

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
special summons and it gets negated then

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.820 
special summons and it gets negated then
attack<00:02:29.510> goes<00:02:29.720> up<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.140> pendulum<00:02:30.560> suddenly

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
attack goes up if you pendulum suddenly

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.050 
attack goes up if you pendulum suddenly
with<00:02:30.950> quill<00:02:31.220> fault<00:02:31.459> they're<00:02:31.610> gonna<00:02:31.700> have<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
with quill fault they're gonna have that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.880 
with quill fault they're gonna have that
full<00:02:32.209> attack<00:02:32.510> anyway<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.530> doesn't<00:02:33.560> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
full attack anyway so it doesn't really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.800 
full attack anyway so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.489> nevertheless<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.480> might<00:02:35.780> not

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
matter but nevertheless this might not

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.440 
matter but nevertheless this might not
be<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> good<00:02:36.319> card<00:02:36.560> against<00:02:37.250> call<00:02:37.489> force<00:02:37.760> anyway

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
be a good card against call force anyway

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.570 
be a good card against call force anyway
because<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:39.680> just<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.220> those<00:02:40.280> cars<00:02:40.519> that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
because it's just one of those cars that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.880 
because it's just one of those cars that
doesn't<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.180> stun<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:42.140> much<00:02:42.500> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
doesn't really stun them that much I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.309 
doesn't really stun them that much I
mean<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.670> can<00:02:43.849> stop<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.300> disk<00:02:44.569> which<00:02:45.170> would

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
mean you can stop the disk which would

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.500 
mean you can stop the disk which would
be<00:02:45.410> really<00:02:45.650> nice<00:02:45.799> but<00:02:46.519> that's<00:02:46.940> kind<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.360> about

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
be really nice but that's kind of about

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.809 
be really nice but that's kind of about
it<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.140> don't<00:02:48.350> get<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.590> Dante<00:02:49.069> boost<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.670> it

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
it you don't get that Dante boost and it

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.789 
it you don't get that Dante boost and it
stays<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.239> attack<00:02:50.600> mode<00:02:50.630> if<00:02:51.170> they<00:02:51.440> summon<00:02:51.739> it

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
stays in attack mode if they summon it

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.039 
stays in attack mode if they summon it
in<00:02:51.830> attack<00:02:51.950> mode<00:02:52.160> obviously<00:02:53.090> it's<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.269> cost<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
in attack mode obviously it's a cost to

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.080 
in attack mode obviously it's a cost to
mill<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.920> they<00:02:55.040> will<00:02:55.190> still<00:02:55.430> get<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.640> one<00:02:55.940> two

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
mill so they will still get that one two

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 
mill so they will still get that one two
three<00:02:56.299> mils<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> problem<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:58.010> it

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
three mils that's not a problem but it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.430 
three mils that's not a problem but it
does<00:02:58.700> mean<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.510> stuns<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.080> lot<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.349> these

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
does mean that it stuns a lot of these

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.559 
does mean that it stuns a lot of these
decks<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.190> feel<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.760> if<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.060> actually<00:03:02.269> do

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
decks and I feel that if you actually do

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.180 
decks and I feel that if you actually do
flip<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.959> against<00:03:03.349> them<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.739> don't

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
flip it against them and you don't

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
flip it against them and you don't
really<00:03:04.489> suffer<00:03:04.790> from<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.569> play<00:03:05.780> Hondas

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
really suffer from it you play Hondas

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.960 
really suffer from it you play Hondas
you<00:03:06.500> play<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.769> send<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.459> put<00:03:07.610> anything

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
you play you send you you put anything

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.520 
you play you send you you put anything
like<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:08.569> just<00:03:08.599> normal<00:03:09.110> someone<00:03:09.380> some

monarchs as well maybe this isn't such a
