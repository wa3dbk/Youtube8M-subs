opinion<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.820> continuing<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.289> good

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
opinion is continuing to do pretty good

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.700 
opinion is continuing to do pretty good
it's<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.610> great<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.750> almost<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's it's not great but that's almost a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's it's not great but that's almost a
good<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> be

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
good thing because you don't want to be

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
good thing because you don't want to be
be<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:58.070> too<00:00:59.070> far<00:00:59.100> ahead<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> itself<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> think

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
be too too far ahead of itself I think

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
be too too far ahead of itself I think
five<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.899> six<00:01:01.109> percent<00:01:01.260> appreciation<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.309> very

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
five to six percent appreciation is very

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.950 
five to six percent appreciation is very
healthy<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.390> about<00:01:03.660> where

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
healthy and I think that's about where

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
healthy and I think that's about where
we<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.619> low<00:01:05.369> inventories<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
we are right now low inventories is a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300 
we are right now low inventories is a
big<00:01:06.420> driver<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.049> support<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.770> prices<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
big driver of support for prices and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
big driver of support for prices and
appreciation<00:01:09.000> although<00:01:09.689> housing<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.170> not

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
appreciation although housing is not

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
appreciation although housing is not
really<00:01:10.560> contributing<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.130> GDP<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.970> growth

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
really contributing to GDP and growth

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270 
really contributing to GDP and growth
there's<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> big<00:01:13.560> difference<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:14.159> between

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there's a big difference there between

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
there's a big difference there between
housing<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.689> contributes<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> economy

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
trouble is it near death well it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.420 
trouble is it near death well it's
another<00:01:31.259> bubble<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> Federal

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
another bubble you know the Federal

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
another bubble you know the Federal

Reserve inflated the first housing

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
Reserve inflated the first housing
bubble<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> burst<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.060> had<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
bubble and when it burst and we had the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
bubble and when it burst and we had the
financial<00:01:36.600> crisis<00:01:37.290> their<00:01:37.470> solution<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
financial crisis their solution was to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.490 
financial crisis their solution was to
try<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> blow<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.390> again<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.290> there's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
try to blow it back up again but there's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
try to blow it back up again but there's
a<00:01:40.560> big<00:01:40.799> difference<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.759> bubble

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
a big difference between the bubble

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
a big difference between the bubble
they've<00:01:42.210> created<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.710> last

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
they've created this time and the last
