love<00:00:46.539> my<00:00:46.660> job<00:00:46.690> because<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:48.070> always<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.640> little

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
love my job because it's always a little

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.340 
love my job because it's always a little
bit<00:00:49.090> of<00:00:49.180> guesswork<00:00:49.480> it's<00:00:49.840> always<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.110> little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
bit of guesswork it's always a little

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.770 
bit of guesswork it's always a little
puzzle<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.920> figure<00:00:51.190> out<00:00:51.370> what<00:00:52.329> is<00:00:52.449> going<00:00:52.660> on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
puzzle to figure out what is going on

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.930 
puzzle to figure out what is going on
because<00:00:53.050> sometimes<00:00:54.010> they<00:00:54.309> don't<00:00:54.430> always<00:00:54.579> want

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
because sometimes they don't always want

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.369 
because sometimes they don't always want
to<00:00:54.969> tell<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.270> what's<00:00:55.420> going<00:00:55.629> on<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:55.899> they

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
to tell you what's going on and they

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.779 
to tell you what's going on and they
don't<00:00:56.559> always<00:00:56.800> want<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.070> tell<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.430> truth

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
don't always want to tell you the truth

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.979 
don't always want to tell you the truth
about<00:00:58.239> what<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.570> going<00:00:58.809> on<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:01.300> also

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
about what is going on so that and also

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.200 
about what is going on so that and also
another<00:01:02.680> reason<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.370> it's<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.879> lot<00:01:04.089> of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
another reason that it's a lot of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.870 
another reason that it's a lot of
guesswork<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.989> if<00:01:05.260> someone<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.400> new

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
guesswork is that if someone is new

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.480 
guesswork is that if someone is new
they've<00:01:07.720> never<00:01:07.990> they<00:01:08.560> don't<00:01:08.740> never<00:01:09.189> knew<00:01:09.369> they

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
they've never they don't never knew they

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.420 
they've never they don't never knew they
had<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.670> mental<00:01:09.970> disorder<00:01:10.180> before<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:12.340> be

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
had a mental disorder before it can be

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.590 
had a mental disorder before it can be
challenging<00:01:12.580> to<00:01:12.850> try<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.119> figure<00:01:13.299> out<00:01:13.390> which

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
challenging to try to figure out which

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.880 
challenging to try to figure out which
one<00:01:13.750> they<00:01:13.869> actually<00:01:14.170> have<00:01:14.350> because<00:01:14.650> some<00:01:14.799> of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
one they actually have because some of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.490 
one they actually have because some of
them<00:01:14.979> are<00:01:15.100> very<00:01:15.130> similar<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.470> depending<00:01:17.470> on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
them are very similar and depending on

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.539 
them are very similar and depending on
what<00:01:17.619> they<00:01:17.710> have<00:01:17.740> depends<00:01:18.189> on<00:01:18.250> what<00:01:18.369> kind<00:01:18.520> of

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
what they have depends on what kind of

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.800 
what they have depends on what kind of
medication<00:01:19.030> they<00:01:19.119> need<00:01:19.150> so<00:01:19.479> it's<00:01:19.600> always<00:01:19.720> a

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
medication they need so it's always a

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.179 
medication they need so it's always a
little<00:01:19.900> bit<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.200> guesswork<00:01:20.350> about<00:01:20.860> what

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
little bit of guesswork about what

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.830 
little bit of guesswork about what
medication<00:01:22.119> they<00:01:22.210> need<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.630> what

combination of medication they may need

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.190 
combination of medication they may need
