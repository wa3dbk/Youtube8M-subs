00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.400
 Well the truth is that yes he has had 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.710

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.210
 little the magic of the place with the food 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.260

 city many tourists also some 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.320
 tourists at the moment and I think that the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.820
 environment is provided by the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.010

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.140
 young people who are behind this offer 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.550
 that are young entrepreneurs who are 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.220
 at this moment fighting to become a 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.660
 gap in working life and with large 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.780
 cooking knowledge and lovers of 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.780
 kitchen 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.910
 Hello 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.690
 to see explain a little what is this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 showcooking concept good when 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.290
 we thought about giving this space a 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.300
 gastronomic offer we imagined that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.020
 the client did not have the pressure of a 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.460
 letter to the restaurant when using some 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 economic needs to be able 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.780
 allow ourselves to go out to dinner because we look for 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.850
 a group of entrepreneurs that are 16 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 entrepreneurs that offer a kind of 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.410
 different food and this allows us to 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 the client come one two three times or 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.700
 several times on the same day even to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.490
 eat al shaiunna for dinner and be able to choose 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.920
 what you want without having to give 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.600
 a rigid letter like I told you before 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.370
 with a budget to suit you 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.650
 one day you can eat an omelette 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.520
 potatoes and a coffee and a coke 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.310
 another that you can have a wine 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.260
 of the price that can be allowed with a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.100
 little sushi or with a entrecote 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.140
 great with a house steak 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.120
 palette another day can simply 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.120
 have breakfast with a bakery that we have 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.400
 terrific that is a couple that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 deals in the work of the bakery and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.200
 they eat a little cake a little while before 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.210
 with a coffee and they rest and then they leave 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 to the ride they had in the city 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.630
 and so on you can make a 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.120
 custom-made menu a menu tailored to your needs 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.110
 with different Italian options and two 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.110
 japanese chinese 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.159
 yes 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 and how is the operation here of what 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.630
 it 's a little bit that people 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.150
 go eating according to him fancying the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.800
 people arrive and go to each of the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.600
 spaces decides that he is going to take 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.750
 a wine and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.420
 some slates go to that place and the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.270
 wine what he pays he takes it to the table then he goes 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.730
 to the place of the food the cloth asks for 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.440
 pay and sit down and eat a 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.569
 determined because he thinks he wants 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.190
 so some calamari or an omelette and 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.650
 then go from themselves to the site 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.480
 corresponding again commissioned him 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.570
 asks and many times they take it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.100
 to the same place or if they do not wait 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.959
 and they take it and they eat it heron 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.690
 you can be sitting at a table and 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.480
 touring the different boxes to go 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.700
 varying of food or you can go setting 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.350
 you in the bar of each box to go 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.970
 moving that all over the place in the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.830
 local that is quite large we have a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.560
 distribution as you see here by 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.290
 example of tables with low stools there 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.299
 another area that there are tables with chairs all 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 the space is surrounded by bars with 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.900
 stools then the idea is to be 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.940
 a very dynamic thing I do not go 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.220
 eating of the desire and being able to go 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.000
 changing space within one's own 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.100
 market 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.530
 if you allow me, I will tell you that we should not 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.570
 confuse a fast food with our 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.850
 space here the food is made in the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.560
 moment that you ask for it showcooking from 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.790
 they really cook in front of you and what 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.620
 important is that getting it not 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.480
 cool your dishes you eat a first 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.950
 dish when the other ate quiet 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.140
 of this second pots and always keeps 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.670
 the exquisite of what has prepared a 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.330
 cook for you exclusively in that 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.430
 You are also eating at the moment 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.800
 if you do not have to think at first what 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.810
 that what you want to eat sometimes the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.090
 tendency to collect all put the 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.190
 table and there is no concept concept 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.100
 is that you choose idrogo more 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.560
 warm good guys, I wish you 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.669
 continue with this success or even more 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.669
 let's hope that more 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.050
 but not
