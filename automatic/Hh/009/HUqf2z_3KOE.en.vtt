00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
were to look at us on continental USA

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.010 
were to look at us on continental USA
you<00:01:57.549> would<00:01:57.820> see<00:01:58.000> us<00:01:58.120> going<00:01:58.299> from<00:01:58.510> east<00:01:58.780> coast

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
you would see us going from east coast

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.469 
you would see us going from east coast
to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.260> west<00:01:59.320> coast<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.850> was<00:02:01.030> trying

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
to the west coast and so it was trying

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.120 
to the west coast and so it was trying
to<00:02:01.659> bring<00:02:01.930> all<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.500> wealth<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:02.979> knowledge

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
to bring all that wealth of knowledge

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
to bring all that wealth of knowledge
together<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.360> it's<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.540> good<00:02:04.690> thing<00:02:04.810> we<00:02:04.960> did

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
together and it's a good thing we did

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.750 
together and it's a good thing we did
because<00:02:05.290> we<00:02:05.380> know<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.770> have<00:02:05.799> lost<00:02:06.159> some<00:02:06.640> of

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
because we know we have lost some of

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.759 
because we know we have lost some of
those<00:02:06.909> people<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.540> instance<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.259> you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
those people for instance and so you

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.380 
those people for instance and so you
know<00:02:08.799> this<00:02:09.039> was<00:02:09.250> an<00:02:09.399> opportunity<00:02:09.759> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
know this was an opportunity to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.800 
know this was an opportunity to
standardize<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.440> care<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:13.390> became

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
standardize that care and and it became

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.929 
standardize that care and and it became
a<00:02:14.409> wealth<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.040> knowledge<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.610> body<00:02:15.790> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.690 
you know just because it's summertime
doesn't<00:04:18.680> mean<00:04:18.830> they<00:04:18.950> don't<00:04:19.070> still<00:04:19.459> have<00:04:19.489> a

as opposed to winter time when they it's
easier<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.970> provide<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:27.169> you<00:04:27.530> know<00:04:27.680> that
