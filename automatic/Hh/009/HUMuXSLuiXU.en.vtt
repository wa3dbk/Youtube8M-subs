00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.029
 and the big question, of course, is why 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.650
 sees someone waving a knife 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.360
 singer johan linssen was with one 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.099
 camera crew also make recordings of clip 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.059
 and he knows more about it without it 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.119
 phone 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.279
 Mr. Lentils what happened yes we 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.359
 were indeed there from my new one 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.060
 gengo video clip recording and on 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.980
 at the end of almost the recordings it came 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.460
 way our past 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.290
 and that leads to a knife and thereby you 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.979
 free with us 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.510
 why yes there the question it already has 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:39.820
 several times there we also have suggests 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.290
 I still don't have it crazy 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.769
 I actually have a faint idea 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.519
 none of our team knows why me 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.350
 rule a very strange walk and none 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.580
 Hands has 100 companies with that knife 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.049
 and that was already a year mama put it on 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.670
 that moment 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.299
 yes we have it at some point 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.250
 because distance from london and 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.080
 we can stood there that way of the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.490
 Marie went and not that far from us 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.530
 from 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:12.750
 and who has to try and get with it 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.750
 pepper spray and unfortunately that did not work 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 few managed with the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.160
 sides of the car run 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.040
 and then i also see the tram 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.560
 a larger one has been brought to a halt 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.590
 huge scare natural for us 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.570
 it was very crazy at that moment for sure 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.700
 because you are there for the recordings 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.650
 from the video clip of cute product it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.810
 holiday feeling to nothing with about the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.680
 vacation go three you expect too 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.210
 not at all 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.650
 confirmed the prosecution 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.390
 by the way in story and what's up with that 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.190
 recording happens 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.860
 well they have none at the marie 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.170
 seized because they are running on time 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.159
 of us that certainly has 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.080
 played and I don't know at the moment 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.940
 whether you are on a longer tour train and me 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.500
 also expect that number of rooms feeling 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.500
 that it is only about the recordings of the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.970
 myself but I can tell he is there 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.390
 nothing at all and this stage left 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.440
 say 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.440
