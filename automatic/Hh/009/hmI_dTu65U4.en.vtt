 persistent and good if there was the contest 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.370
 or I did not feel like it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.530
 I entered the contest and I do not know what 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.840
 which is like for one because it was one thing 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.030
 very had one to have the cell phone in the

 hand at that time if you have not yet 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.380
 they called and did not answer they called three 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.750
 times and if one did not answer the call 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.140
 I lost the option 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.690
 and by a pure coincidence of things that 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 they pass at school at that time I 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.800

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.150
 to participate in the contest being 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.979
 one of the four happy winners by 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.660
 the channel were giving the propaganda of 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 they were doing the launching of 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.869
 a new post-soap speed soda 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.830
 then that the contest of 21 was opened 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.680
 September the methodology that one 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.450
 I picked up soda lids and inside 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.970
 the cover came a code that was a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.660
 mixture of was alphanumeric numbers and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.830
 letters then one would go in speed to 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.050
 www speed gaseosa dotcom and registered 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.420
 an account and began to introduce the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.920
 codes indicates the teacher who picked up 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.229
 the caps of the institution where 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.630
 work entering later a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.700
 average of 30 codes then I 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 I started at school like children 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.830
 they buy so much soda 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.390
 to pick up the covers there 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.160
 I found the bottles that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.899
 them as what for it was garbage 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 for me it was a great opportunity not 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.430
 that they leave lying around sometimes 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.020
 are lacquer in the same canecas then 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.970
 I found the covers and looked at the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.250
 code and bay and then did the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.570
