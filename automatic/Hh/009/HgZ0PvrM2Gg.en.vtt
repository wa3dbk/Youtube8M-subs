00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.520
 this is the aquarium that already has 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.959
 put enough water and I'm installing 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.910
 Now the inputs and outputs of water 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.480
 specifically I will try a system of 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.090
 flute 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.330
 and the pre filter 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.670
 what do you see here of three parts to try 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.270
 hold it with the suckers but I do not know 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.439
 held up well so I'm going to put 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.260
 way of securing a sponge 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.520
 pre filter that I had seen before for 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.710
 press and hold the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.900
 you take and it looks like it's pretty firm 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.450
 and pretty good 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 here you see the filter that has been 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.010
 circulating running in an aquarium of 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.310
 quarantine without fish 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:02.310
 he unplugged it then I close the taps 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.310
 and decoupled the intakes and outputs 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.580
 and I will take it to the aquarium of 150 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 liters 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.230
 As you can see, the water intake is classic 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.580
 in the form of a cane but we in the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.270
 aquarium of 150 we will use the intakes that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.270
 you just saw with a screw cap 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 above 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 to be able to see inside the furniture 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.530
 what 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.430
 which as you can see is quite spacious and not 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.890
 has no shelf or anything because I'm going to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 temporarily put a wall lamp 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.820
 be able to see what I do 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.130
 If you look at the tubes, I put some 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.130
 clamps 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.720
 of metal purchased at the hardware store are 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 a little dangerous to use because if you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.050
 you pass by tightening the clamp you can 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 split the plastic from the socket you have to 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.800
 always have a lot of pulse when squeezing and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.980
 to the minimum the minimum sensation that 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.980
 is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.000
 putting a little hard to squeeze not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.060
 leave it and that's enough 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.930
 sure there's nothing worse than one of these 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.220
 shots are accidentally released because 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.220
 the whole aquarium would be emptied 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.000
 Now let's put it all the best 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.000
 possible 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:50.410
 and we are going to close the shots 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.410
 of entry and exit uncovering 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 the screw caps and priming with water 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 this is the entrance 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.660
 and how the filter also came with 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.350
 Water 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.850
 because it would stay full of water and not 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.300
 there was nothing more to plug so that 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.300
 start working 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.200
 you just have to open the taps of the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.360
 filter plug 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.910
 and once I was primed with this 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.900
 system you do not have to do anything else there's 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.349
 what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.620
 do nothing siphon sides on one thing 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.620
 strange 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.200
 you see a spot down there 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.720
 and wood color that is of a moisture 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.690
 but it has nothing to do with any 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.810
 loss of electricity from the aquarium if 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.330
 you see is totally centered does not have 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.060
 connection with the boards and it will go 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.370
 reabsorbing little by little you see how 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 plugged in and now it's starting to work 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.910
 the filter 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.590
 and now we are going to place some tapas 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.590
 sliding and for that it is enough to use 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.120
 some lanes of aluminum has not been 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.950
 cut at one end a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.760
 I've done them a little bit so that 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.220
 do not trip 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 with the silicone band and they are supported 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.520
 in the ribs of the two sides 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.300
 and on the front rib of the aquarium 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.699
 the covers are crystals that have to 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.279
 have a dimension a little more 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.800
 small so they go baggy 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.379
 in my case they could have been a little 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.259
 tighter but the important thing is that 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.949
 they do not fall and run well so they 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.949
 I will leave like this 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.449
 I'm going to show you one of the extremes that 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.570
 the filing so they do not trip over this 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:06.810
 front silicone edge because this 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.930
 type of chapucillas must be done with 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.000
 quite frequently 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.000
 so everything fits perfectly 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.490
 and now let's put 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.900
 for as a support for the other two 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.760
 side covers that are triangular 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.610
 an aluminum profile in the shape of tea 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.819
 stuck with black silicone 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.969
 for aquariums this black silicone I have 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.889
 used quite little use it for 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.259
 to make me the quarantine aquarium 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.229
 it has not been too well 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:52.249
 we are going to be a little bit botched but 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.249
 at least it works 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.419
 here we put the other support for the 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:03.510
 another cover are two glass caps 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.520
 triangular 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.420
 that go on each of the two sides 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.420
 of the aquarium 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.520
 have to put some supports so that 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.389
 do not fall 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.389
 down 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.100
 after that 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.100
 you have to clean a little 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:44.259
 and we'll leave it waiting for 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.839
 to cure the silicone well and that 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.630
 stay solid before continuing 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:51.680
 doing 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.680
 and other things
