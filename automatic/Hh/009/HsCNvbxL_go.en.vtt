00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
that they will die and if they don't

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.029 
that they will die and if they don't
then<00:01:39.939> it's<00:01:40.090> probably<00:01:40.689> like<00:01:40.869> or<00:01:41.020> something<00:01:41.319> if

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
then it's probably like or something if

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.469 
then it's probably like or something if
you<00:01:42.159> choose<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.549> use<00:01:42.670> either<00:01:42.819> weapon<00:01:43.240> like

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
you choose to use either weapon like

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.600 
you choose to use either weapon like
this<00:01:43.600> then<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.380> would<00:01:44.530> go<00:01:44.679> for<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.950> red<00:01:45.069> dot<00:01:45.340> say

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
this then I would go for the red dot say

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.370 
this then I would go for the red dot say
or<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:45.880> reflex<00:01:46.270> say<00:01:46.509> or<00:01:46.689> maybe<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.990> ACOG

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
more versatility with the m16 due to the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.930 
more versatility with the m16 due to the
number<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.920> possible<00:02:15.310> attachments<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
but with these test results I'm guessing

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.250 
but with these test results I'm guessing
like<00:02:21.549> most<00:02:21.910> people<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.390> myself<00:02:22.599> we<00:02:23.019> choose

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
like most people like myself we choose

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.220 
like most people like myself we choose
to<00:02:23.500> open<00:02:24.040> either<00:02:24.190> rifle<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.780> again<00:02:26.019> you'll

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
to open either rifle but again you'll

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
to open either rifle but again you'll
notice<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.739> g11<00:02:26.950> seems<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.459> be<00:02:27.549> much

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
notice that the g11 seems to be much

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.340 
notice that the g11 seems to be much
more<00:02:27.760> accurate<00:02:28.090> due<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> lack<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:28.959> recoil

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
more accurate due to the lack of recoil

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.229 
more accurate due to the lack of recoil
okay<00:02:32.350> I'll<00:02:32.620> let<00:02:32.709> these<00:02:33.340> last<00:02:33.609> tests<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.209> a

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
okay I'll let these last tests with a

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.819 
okay I'll let these last tests with a
little<00:02:34.510> bit<00:02:34.630> pointless<00:02:34.930> chances<00:02:35.530> are<00:02:35.680> you're

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
little bit pointless chances are you're

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.800 
little bit pointless chances are you're
not<00:02:35.859> going<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.280> using<00:02:36.609> the<00:02:36.760> m16<00:02:37.389> or<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> g11

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
not going to be using the m16 or the g11

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.509 
not going to be using the m16 or the g11
that's<00:02:38.530> course<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.069> you're<00:02:39.220> very<00:02:39.370> good

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
that's course and you're very good

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.309 
that's course and you're very good
distance<00:02:39.819> away<00:02:39.940> anyway<00:02:40.389> so<00:02:40.540> let's<00:02:40.989> move<00:02:41.170> over

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
distance away anyway so let's move over

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.949 
distance away anyway so let's move over
back<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.590> little<00:02:41.859> shall<00:02:42.099> we<00:02:42.630> okay<00:02:43.630> well<00:02:43.780> not

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
back a little shall we okay well not

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.240 
back a little shall we okay well not
exactly<00:02:44.139> father<00:02:44.440> back<00:02:44.709> but<00:02:44.950> I'll<00:02:45.069> do<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.190> for

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
exactly father back but I'll do it for

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.610 
exactly father back but I'll do it for
the<00:02:45.370> sake<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.579> this<00:02:45.700> video<00:02:46.290> from<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:47.440> we

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the sake of this video from here we

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.809 
the sake of this video from here we
should<00:02:47.650> get<00:02:47.859> a<00:02:47.889> much<00:02:48.069> better<00:02:48.220> idea<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.730> the
