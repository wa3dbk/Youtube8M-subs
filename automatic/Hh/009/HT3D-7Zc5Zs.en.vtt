00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.080
 as I said in the previous block the state of mato grosso do sul has great 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.300
 potential for growth in the area of ​​planted forests and consequently 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.760
 can attract new businesses by generating many jobs 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.280
 this reality is already a fact in the city of three lagoons and begins to become 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.739
 reality rivers of the brown river 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.819
 attention to large business opportunities in the agriculture and 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:24.530
 Livestock 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.439
 is today in the state of mato grosso do sul 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.699
 the need for diversification of the country's energy matrix 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.830
 and the implantation of large companies of the sector in the state 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.450
 a great opportunity for producers who are interested in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.720
 diversify activities on their rural properties 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.110
 besides having the second largest cattle herd 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.710
 and the largest slaughterhouses in the country the cultivation of planted forests comes 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.450
 emerging as the most promising and most profitable way to unite livestock and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.360
 forestry in a single property 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 add value to the product harvested 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.200
 the wood 'in transforming it into consumption goods 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.190
 The rest of the team is easy to laugh. 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.160
 will provide according to the researchers 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.280
 another option for generating income for rural producers 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.330
 In addition to this economic issue, forestry consultants 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.719
 forest panel highlighted the soil suitability of south-mato-grossenses 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.670
 for the cultivation of several species from outside 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.420
 in the Midwest 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.189
 think about four million and 700 thousand hectares 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.480
 who can absolve the implementation of the activity 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.060
 the state of mato grosso sul has extraordinary conditions to establish 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.340
 a policy that involves family agriculture 'and there business in a 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.190
 dynamic process of socio-environmental sustainable partnerships 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 and economically viable mainly on the large field axis-three lagoons but 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 not having taken over the world is that a few years in the region of three ponds 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 but become a forestry pole and we did not have numerous other companies 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.630
 working in the forest chain is just a matter of time 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.160
 whole world this interlagos will not be different the demand will manage the whole 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.970
 state 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.870
 on a larger scale depending on the case we completed 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.550
 industries that already exists 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.750
 it is from those who have seen that we do not know how many times a derby with the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.939
 productivity of 5 5 cubic meters of kate the ordinance nº 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.110
 with the climate we have with the dreams that we have cheaper with 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.279
 financing we have I think what the best place in Brazil predicts 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:35.370
 this beginning of cultures and soft thick mato of the treasure we had there 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.429
 first 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.139
 the ox after the formation minhota now sugar cane 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.619
 undeniably the 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.179
 the most promising 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.179
 here we have in the state today is the forest 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.499
 - we had to count the countless 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.319
 contacts coming 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 is that the production secretariat has been receiving 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.529
 five interested people send dressing in this sector in the southern thicket 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:09.249
 we can is start preparing us because he will be 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.049
 she's the time of the sector time 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.559
 in this two of them of the project state the proposal of the professor bill 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:20.359
 the forest-based industry investor so today we know with 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.109
 For sure, for example, in our congressional public, a lot of people 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.709
 southern state with entrepreneurial sauces 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.279
 Another important point is the possibility of consorting the 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:35.299
 basically the silviculture 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.299
 large areas of degraded pasture 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.289
 state 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:45.979
 most of them running a serious risk of desertification if there is no 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.650
 an alternative of soil management 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.269
 and in the productive process 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.300
 which can lead to soil collapse 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.529
 the environment and hence as media 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.049
 agrosilvopastoral systems 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.479
 I represent a dead policeman 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.319
 murilo lution and technique of 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.069
 sustainability 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.479
 so desirable country 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.939
 cristina woman really for me for many 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.900
 works in the area does not exist this possibility mato grosso do sul 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.199
 has approximately 200 thousand hectares' planted 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.350
 with forests of eucalyptus and pine and can reach the tv of 500 thousand ah 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.270
 millions of hectares of planted forests generating countless jobs and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.789
 distributed throughout the production chain and mainly 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.729
 preserving the heritage of future generations 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.610
 what is a show 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.979
 some cattle ranchers 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.210
 are already walking in this direction we have a short-term 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.150
 Livestock 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.840
 and in the long run the eucalyptus motto 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.480
 because the big problem is or other expenses that you have from time to time 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.949
 that the eucalyptus will solve and with a detail you plant it has surpassed 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.080
 degraded 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.129
 and you will have a band of seven in seven years 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.240
 who solves a lot of giving to do 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.559
 would recommend 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.569
 I would recommend it to anyone. 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.300
 with any institutions such as sebrae 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.340
 the state's production secretariat and the South-Mato Grosso 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.270
 producers 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.569
 and consumers of planted forests reforest ms 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.999
 has actively participated in all activities aimed at singing the area 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.689
 planted with forests in the state and the prospects are very large easy 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.860
 culture with certainty 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.610
 is an activity here today has profitability what we need is 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.169
 we adapt to this activity in its circle in its most hectare 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.189
 as activity is highly profitable today inclusive and if you compare 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.050
 not wanting to compare with the other mothers 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.110
 today you are exceptionally profitable today, especially today with 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.830
 this lack of flag with the photo ap of the raw material that we are not 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.220
 meeting friends and Brazil so we understand that it is a sector that is 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.630
 in expansion we have large industries already installed and 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.479
 installing in the region 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.889
 and we realize that we have to organize this chain for the search 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.020
 bring the economic generation to both those who are directly investing 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.870
 which will also generate a multiplier effect for other companies that 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.110
 in the region to serve this sector that is expanding 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.219
 states if the southern thicket managed to increase its area 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.780
 planted with forests 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.449
 to one million hectares 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.569
 this total makes up less than 2 08 percent of the territory of the state 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.419
 and the consequences are extremely favorable 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.069
 see the numbers 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.589
 it will be possible to generate 300 to 400 thousand new jobs in all its 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:47.400
 productive chain 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.689
 generate in taxes the equivalent of twice 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.310
 the value of the state pib 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.180
 that is 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.500
 to 10 or up to 14 billion reais per year 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.399
 and most importantly 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:03.830
 recover degraded soil estimated at more than one million 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.690
 the show 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.850
 is the largest asset the state has
