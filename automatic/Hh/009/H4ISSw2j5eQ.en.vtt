have a very unique offset design with

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
have a very unique offset design with
either<00:01:38.939> single<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.570> dual<00:01:39.810> shafts<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.560> the

either single or dual shafts and the
idea<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.119> bring<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> gearbox

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
idea here is you can bring the gearbox

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.170 
idea here is you can bring the gearbox
much<00:01:43.320> closer<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> load<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.820> allow<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
much closer to the load but allow the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340 
much closer to the load but allow the
motor<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.810> offset<00:01:46.170> from<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.220> frame<00:01:48.350> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
motor to be offset from the frame this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
motor to be offset from the frame this
is<00:01:49.500> our<00:01:49.619> hires<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.159> larger<00:01:50.520> sized<00:01:50.790> helical

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
is our hires a larger sized helical

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.590 
is our hires a larger sized helical

see it's a more straightforward type of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.719 
see it's a more straightforward type of
