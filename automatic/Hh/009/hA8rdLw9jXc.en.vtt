00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 so rich that I ate I was super sleepy 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.540
 if they follow me in my networks 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.730
 social workers will realize that right now 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 I'm eating healthier I'm 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 doing a little exercise and then 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.939
 I want to resume this healthy diet 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 I have everything a little so that my 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 body is very healthy I want to teach them 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 how do you make this delicious salad with 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.719
 fruits that I tell you of so rich that I ate 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.460
 I fell asleep I do not know how many hours so 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.250
 If your plan is also to start eating 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.370
 thank you I've been testing it as 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 it took me about a week or so and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 I feel great the same way later 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.710
 you will see healthy recipes some not so 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 healthy others that the dessert is already 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 you know but anyway here we continue and if 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 you want to know how this salad is made 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.870
 with fruits do not stop watching the video 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.920
 Well, let's start with this salad 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.280
 the truth I do not know that the name has 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.400
 I do not know what they call him, let's put him 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.110
 salad with fruits I'm not the father and 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.509
 as a good salad should carry 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.810
 lettuce and even romaine lettuce either 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.450
 lettuce haysbert be it French lettuce 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.520
 or lettuce batavia or maybe a lettuce 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 red oak leaf 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.270
 all those I learned them nothing 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.369
 confinement is low I'm looking for it in 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.440
 wikipedia you know we put where we're going to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.500
 serve the salad we put a portion 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.750
 generous of lettuce of different types 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.670
 of which you like a nice bed 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.080
 of lettuce to later add the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.160
 fruits that are 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.380
 Strawberry mango and apple know I can 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.300
 give advice the fruits there are always 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.800
 to split them as differently 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.140
 either in the form of a triangle or 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.240
 square in strips as you like 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.910
 and that will make them that they please 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.980
 more those incredible colors that give us 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.380
 the fruits add a little in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.090
 little the amount that you like 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 If they do not like the strawberry they can 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.540
 change it or put more handle or put 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.100
 a little bit more of I do not know about apple and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.960
 remember what I say, you have to have 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.170
 always well washed our hands 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.570
 many have cooking and that's going to be 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.910
 the difference an error if I but that is 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.980
 can fix was itching the apple 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
 first before everything but so that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.959
 it becomes yellowish I give you a tip 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.700
 with the apple in water with a few drops 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.310
 of lemon and ready 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 we drain and add I do not know if to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.150
 you but they are already touching me 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 cannon after this step I like 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.680
 add sunflower seeds that give 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.469
 a special touch I swear is not 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.980
 nothing but if you know delicious with 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.980
 sunflower seeds 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 I also love adding blueberries 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.120
 Dry these sell them on the market will 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.550
 give that sweet touch to this salad 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.910
 which also gives a good flavor and does not 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.250
 you must stop adding are nuts I 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.840
 crush them a bit with my hands or what 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.510
 you can do with a knife with what 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.820
 you want and spread them all over you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.400
 sweet salad of dried cranberries 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.709
 the touch has been of the strawberry the softness 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.260
 of the mango the lettuce that gives it the flavor 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.600
 cool the apple that looked like the fresh 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.970
 cut the sunflower seeds give you 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.770
 a special touch to your salad you 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 you can remove you can add it 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.630
 that you want and now we continue with the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.150
 mustard dressing with honey to bathe and 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.489
 better to decorate this salad for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.090
 mustard and honey dressing we are going to 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.850
 need 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.070
 obviously mustard a spoonful too 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.950
 we will add a spoonful of honey 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.280
 bee and we stir a little bit add a 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.470
 small trickle of apple cider vinegar 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.780
 and we stir, I added a little 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.490
 pepper this is to taste if you want 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 put a no in fact if you want to leave 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.090
 the dressing like that is perfect but you 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.010
 I say I added some pepper 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.700
 I'm going to add some oregano 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.700
 ground 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.810
 and we have to get rid of this 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.629
 consistency I do not know but this dressing 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.090
 it was perfect with the fruit salad 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.509
 and now we have to enjoy our 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.509
 salad 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.489
 I hope they make you take a picture worth 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:58.039
 salad or the same at the time of the 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:59.809
 preparation will be great and tag in 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.369

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:03.169
 they leave them in an information box 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:05.089
