00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.200
 the other group completed ten years in Brazil with great competence 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.060
 presented to the main markets brands of products facing the canopy 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.659
 currently offering 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.059
 playing their role 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.409
 multibrands is making five brands here from brazil 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 five major appliance brands 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.400
 the best in the world here with Brazil one of these wonderful things 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.470
 of the delicate one that is the main world producer after France 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.520
 and team 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.520
 is the great generator of technology in the area after 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.530
 the other the great production that we are doing here in Brazil also 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.960
 are the least three mutias steam generators 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.830
 coolers debut from the libero 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.730
 of the German and Austrian bieber 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.500
 and is also the great generator of technology in the area of ​​refrigeration 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.859
 is the world's leading producer 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.409
 today in technological terms within the refrigeration segment 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.550
 so the built-in refrigerators there was a gap that in our market 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 Helped magic here in Brazil. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 which we hardly have and coolers 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.450
 available on the market 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.850
 for inlay 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.860
 if you will joint common refrigerator 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.690
 inlay it will not work properly it will not work 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.350
 burn one 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 with the price of other 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.310
 harmful consequences however the products that are made to embed 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.149
 they are already prepared to work in the closure of the flights was 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.620
 like this 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.250
 and therefore they have 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.659
 a technology 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.210
 all specific 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.780
 much more powerful than the refrigerator as 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 this is the second product besides érika and the leader 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 so we are also bringing the wonderful stoves of bertazonni vou 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 say they are the most you will see extras from the stoves if the stoves made 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.430
 there in modena region even so manufacturing years 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.140
 the world's top automobile brands 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.290
 Henrique 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.020
 bring spectacular technological content at the same time as 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.219
 shipley silva and we have to think 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.449
 they bring modern designs 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:16.469
 as well as of Chinese he criticized be it of more classic skirts 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.940
 here are going to be looks like our next had 111 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.639
 of the beginning of the kitchen 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.059
 Here in Brazil 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.189
 in parallel we are also bringing here 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.819
 already in 10 years we are celebrating 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.560
 this year ten years he violated a fraque in brazil that brought the whole 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.959
 coercion to which they will bring their furnaces to worship 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.379
 stoves I went steiner and stoves of embutir also here that Brazil lives 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.079
 we are currently 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.599
 creating another brand here in Brazil what the techno brand 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.929
 a brand that is a specific division of the madness of Brazil 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.099
 for products 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.120
 technically special products that have technical characteristics 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.179
 that would not fit 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.049
 on other brands 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.569
 is an oyster management wrong with this vexing technique that is division 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.349
 will say so 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.499
 darlan the fraque is another brand in the situation aggravates that way we are 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.189
 working and therefore the main ones he also think that one of the main 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.010
 world producers and offering this marvelous market that the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.369
 Brazilian 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.529
 that presented by novelties 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.039
 and each time he put the team of professionals from the areas that are here 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.749
 in this fair 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.749
 increasingly more specific products 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:39.119
 ab it each haul now recently the eric habitasa them 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.439
 comes to meet those types of kitchens that are integrated with fever or die 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.339
 with the living room 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:51.999
 of these kitchens the noise level is very important you can not 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.559
 for example 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.739
 sending you that you're watching a symphony you're listening to or 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.579
 simply the chat between friends that is taking place in the kitchen room 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.279
 It's not the kitchen room to greet friends. 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.279
 so she wanted the coi to be very powerful 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:17.539
 very silent and with these aesthetics that you are seeing here that 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.020
 the concept of being luminaires is also 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.530
 are 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.670
 very powerful very powerful hoods the capacity of a hood and can 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.849
 related intrinsically with its noise level 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.969
 the more potent a hood 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.090
 sooner as she has 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.449
 and the greater its development 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.960
 lower this noise level 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.699
 so when you see the world's leading producer of ethanol 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.410
 producing things with virtually debt to seven cubic meters 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.419
 outside 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.800
 né these quotas with the noise level day below 60 decibels you say 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 our tomorrow here is innovation 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.659
 here there is applied technology 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.639
 the theft of people who are users 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.460
 so there is left 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.780
 it's one of the things 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.809
 low noise level due to high capacities 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:12.979
 vehicle 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.669
 the aesthetic use 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.770
 integrated with this new trend, which are 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.059
 the integrated kitchens by action 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.219
 o wine conservation you have six variables that are considered 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.650
 main 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.620
 for example the radiation is ultraviolet 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.780
 the other violent spoiled wine is not enough for example 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.900
 the beer bottle the brown 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.069
 in your video she suffers the influence and vice degrades 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.080
 if it receives the ultraviolet ray and then 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.889
 the loads made by the leader who claims to be the best steaks in the world 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.550
 obviously they all have two glasses with ultraviolet protection 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.629
 See how our votes are 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.069
 the team also the ultraviolet protection 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.839
 this is the first situation the second situation a harley der for example 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.360
 developed 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.650
 one thing that is very damaging pros nearby vibration of refrigerated kv 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.080
 then developed compressors 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.319
 Do not you ever think about it here? 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.349
 for the UN because they do not boot it will not only slow down or 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:16.270
 accelerate 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.629
 the speed just to cause less vibration 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.699
 and where one would need very large compressors and split 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:24.360
 sar 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.880
 this large capacity of compression 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.650
 and 2 smaller compressors in such a way that both produce less vibration 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.620
 of what I am 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 despite his being reciprocal antibes never 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.969
 to stop voting in the 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.710
 so were our guys are also considered the best of the 

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:43.969
 world 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.569
 also imported they do not vibrate they do not transmit vibration to wine 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:52.680
 Another important factor is the precision of the controls 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.250
 when you have a little dog identified there for the 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.590
 example 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.590
 five of them presents temperature of 5 degrees 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.729
 can put a term broadly that will give 5 degrees is not 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.559
 an indication melo the pictorial mind is an indication to really is real 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:11.219
 of the temperature would be in the house 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:12.570
 so you present 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.080
 a temperature for example to drink a wine of 16 degrees in the red wine what 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.080
 it's vital 16 degrees when you take it from there and so on 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.189
 cars like tite will have chest 

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:26.060
 has three independent independent temperatures 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.860
 to the point you can disconnect a session from tomorrow the others continue 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.929
 it works said 'you do not have so many wines at that moment 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.999
 is that after another thing that greatly damages the wines 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.249
 having the quality of the air that stayed the day of the wines so a load sometimes 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:46.199
 can you go to the beach house that is closed 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.210
 and can add some good value was such a thing 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:52.809
 the charges of releasing them have 

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:55.020
 the purification of air through 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.410
 activated charcoal filter which resides in the household through which the 

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.379
 coal 

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:03.409
 prada just the carotid in the kitchen kutcher diary schiavo if I will not 

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:04.550
 I'll pass on wine 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.150
 and also if she has a garage or a beach house too 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.699
 that smell of the beach house garage 

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.639
 will not go to the end too 

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.300
 so you with the best cerol
