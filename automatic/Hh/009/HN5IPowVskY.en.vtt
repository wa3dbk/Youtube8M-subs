first<00:01:25.229> off<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> base<00:01:25.710> he<00:01:25.920> does<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
first off the base he does come with the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
first off the base he does come with the
base<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> hundred<00:01:27.840> percent<00:01:27.990> sure<00:01:28.320> what

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
base I'm not a hundred percent sure what

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
base I'm not a hundred percent sure what
the<00:01:28.829> space<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.700> mean<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.960> might<00:01:31.140> be

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the space is I mean I think it might be

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.899 
the space is I mean I think it might be
like<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> Hall<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> Oliver<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.729> like

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
like the Hall of Oliver is kind of like

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
like the Hall of Oliver is kind of like
a<00:01:32.939> area<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> armor<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
a area for the armor but I'm not sure it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210 
a area for the armor but I'm not sure it
could<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.299> wall<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> base<00:01:37.979> I'm

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
could just be a wall with a base I'm

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
could just be a wall with a base I'm
just<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.670> quite<00:01:39.180> sure<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.680 
see that thing and then you can lift it
up<00:04:59.450> so<00:05:00.350> there<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.190> mean<00:05:01.550> unless<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.270> really

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
up so there is I mean unless you really

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.870 
up so there is I mean unless you really
take<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:02.990> all<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.230> way<00:05:03.380> out<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:04.400> is<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.730> only

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
take it all the way out this is the only

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.340 
take it all the way out this is the only
way<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.360> can<00:05:05.510> have<00:05:05.720> his<00:05:05.960> leg<00:05:06.170> completely

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
way that you can have his leg completely

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.250 
way that you can have his leg completely
just<00:05:06.890> out<00:05:07.010> like<00:05:07.190> this<00:05:07.690> because<00:05:08.690> if<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:08.990> do

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
just out like this because if you do

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.110 
just out like this because if you do
face<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.620> this<00:05:09.740> way<00:05:09.920> then<00:05:10.190> he<00:05:10.370> can't<00:05:10.640> have<00:05:10.910> his

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
face it this way then he can't have his

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.240 
face it this way then he can't have his
leg<00:05:11.330> out<00:05:11.540> it's<00:05:12.440> kind<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.680> confusing<00:05:12.860> but

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
leg out it's kind of confusing but

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.980 
leg out it's kind of confusing but
there's<00:05:13.430> absolutely<00:05:13.940> no<00:05:14.090> way<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.840> actually

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
there's absolutely no way to actually

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.200 
there's absolutely no way to actually
just<00:05:15.470> get<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.830> these<00:05:16.130> legs<00:05:16.370> just<00:05:16.610> separated<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
just get the these legs just separated a

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.780 
just get the these legs just separated a
little<00:05:17.570> bit<00:05:17.690> without<00:05:18.250> having<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.370> all<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.700> way

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
little bit without having it all the way

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.600 
little bit without having it all the way
up<00:05:19.940> here<00:05:19.970> or<00:05:20.780> having<00:05:21.260> his<00:05:21.440> leg<00:05:21.650> up<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:22.070> bit<00:05:22.280> to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
up here or having his leg up a bit to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.380 
up here or having his leg up a bit to
take<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.210> out<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:24.080> yeah<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.790> fact<00:05:26.000> rods<00:05:26.210> are

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
take it out so yeah so the fact rods are

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.060 
take it out so yeah so the fact rods are
not<00:05:26.540> great<00:05:26.840> there's<00:05:27.410> definitely<00:05:27.860> room<00:05:27.920> for

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
not great there's definitely room for

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.310 
not great there's definitely room for
improving<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.120> still<00:05:29.450> works<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.020> still

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
improving but it still works and still

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.410 
improving but it still works and still
nice<00:05:30.530> would<00:05:31.250> have<00:05:31.340> been<00:05:31.460> easy<00:05:31.790> fix<00:05:32.150> just

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
nice would have been easy fix just

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.390 
nice would have been easy fix just
having<00:05:32.690> to<00:05:32.810> put<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> hinge<00:05:33.230> right<00:05:33.440> here<00:05:33.740> but<00:05:34.280> um

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
having to put a hinge right here but um

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.970 
having to put a hinge right here but um
but<00:05:34.610> they<00:05:34.760> didn't<00:05:35.000> do<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.560> just<00:05:36.560> because<00:05:36.950> I

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
but they didn't do it so just because I

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860 
but they didn't do it so just because I
think<00:05:37.250> just<00:05:37.670> everything<00:05:38.180> else<00:05:38.570> is<00:05:38.720> really

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
think just everything else is really

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.050 
think just everything else is really
good<00:05:39.110> with<00:05:39.260> him<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.620> I'm<00:05:40.100> not<00:05:40.160> too<00:05:40.610> bummed<00:05:40.880> out

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
good with him so I'm not too bummed out

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.030 
good with him so I'm not too bummed out
on<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.450> it's<00:05:41.900> not<00:05:42.140> great<00:05:42.410> but<00:05:42.440> I'm<00:05:42.740> not<00:05:42.770> too

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
on that it's not great but I'm not too

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.400 
on that it's not great but I'm not too
bummed<00:05:43.220> out<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:44.480> five<00:05:44.750> swivels<00:05:45.200> are

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
bummed out of it the five swivels are

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.230 
bummed out of it the five swivels are
very<00:05:45.800> loose<00:05:46.100> though<00:05:46.430> they're<00:05:46.670> not<00:05:46.790> totally

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
very loose though they're not totally

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.150 
very loose though they're not totally
loose<00:05:47.630> you<00:05:47.750> can<00:05:47.780> still<00:05:48.140> support<00:05:48.320> himself<00:05:48.680> it's

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
loose you can still support himself it's

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.550 
loose you can still support himself it's
just<00:05:49.340> they're<00:05:49.550> loose<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.270> in<00:05:50.690> really<00:05:51.320> wide

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
just they're loose so in really wide
