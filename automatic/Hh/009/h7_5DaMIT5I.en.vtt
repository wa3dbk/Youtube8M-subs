00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
set up all your traps one of

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.620 
set up all your traps one of
modifications<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:31.849> think<00:00:32.060> every<00:00:32.240> trap<00:00:32.450> should

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
modifications I think every trap should

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:43.000 
modifications I think every trap should
have<00:00:32.780> I'll<00:00:33.620> show<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:33.860> how<00:00:34.100> its<00:00:34.310> set<00:00:34.460> up<00:00:41.980> see<00:00:42.980> if

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
have I'll show you how its set up see if

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.140 
have I'll show you how its set up see if
we<00:00:43.130> didn't<00:00:43.340> have<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.580> now<00:00:43.700> we'd<00:00:43.910> have<00:00:44.030> to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
we didn't have that now we'd have to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.930 
we didn't have that now we'd have to
adjust<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.600> by<00:00:45.310> slowly<00:00:46.310> pulling<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.820> down

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
adjust that by slowly pulling it down

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.100 
adjust that by slowly pulling it down
until<00:00:47.150> we<00:00:47.270> got<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.540> where<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:47.690> thought<00:00:47.960> we

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
until we got it where we thought we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.530 
until we got it where we thought we
would<00:00:48.410> want<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.520> set<00:00:49.790> we<00:00:50.120> won't<00:00:50.270> know<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
would want it set we won't know the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.520 
would want it set we won't know the
exact<00:00:50.870> pan<00:00:51.520> wait<00:00:52.520> to<00:00:52.940> set<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:53.270> off<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.410> we

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
exact pan wait to set this off but we

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.600 
exact pan wait to set this off but we
would<00:00:54.650> probably<00:00:54.860> have<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.220> height<00:00:55.370> pretty

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
would probably have the height pretty

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.220 
would probably have the height pretty
good<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.270> can<00:00:56.420> see<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.660> heights<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.990> little

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
good you can see the heights a little

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.680 
good you can see the heights a little
high<00:00:57.430> when<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.520> pull<00:00:58.700> it<00:00:58.820> down<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.150> will<00:00:59.270> click
