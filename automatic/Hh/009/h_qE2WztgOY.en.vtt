00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
not a radical departure but no this is

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.400 
not a radical departure but no this is
new<00:05:20.490> stuff<00:05:20.790> up<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.270> think<00:05:21.960> it's<00:05:22.080> got<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.290> little

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
new stuff up I think it's got a little

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.800 
new stuff up I think it's got a little
subtle<00:05:22.830> bit<00:05:23.010> too<00:05:23.250> which<00:05:23.520> are<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.790> really<00:05:24.690> good

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
subtle bit too which are a really good

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.570 
subtle bit too which are a really good
touch<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.320> rapido<00:05:25.980> really<00:05:26.280> good<00:05:26.400> job<00:05:26.550> with

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
touch and rapido really good job with

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.570 
touch and rapido really good job with
that<00:05:26.730> so<00:05:27.120> I<00:05:27.510> think<00:05:28.050> they've<00:05:28.710> they've<00:05:28.980> held

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
that so I think they've they've held

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.210
