00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello today I'll teach you to make a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 delicious chocolate chocolates in 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.070
 heart shape arriving with truffles 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.200
 beaten for this we are going to use the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.600
 following ingredients for our 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.080
 truffle chocolates we will use 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.120
 better coverage in this case we have of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.700
 bitter chocolate and white chocolate 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.890
 for decorations we have our 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.470
 mold in this case in the form of hearts 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.309
 we are also going to use these sleeves 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.950
 disposable and we will also use 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.410
 our chocolate channel that I'm going to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 teach how to prepare it first thing 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 let's do is bring the fire here to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 bain marie what do you mean in a pot 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.089
 with hot water life the pot with water 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 the burner is off and we are going to 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.970
 let melt the dark chocolate 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.740
 like white chocolate 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.790
 then once you have this chocolate 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.580
 melted let's add it here in the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.670
 heart of hearts and we're going to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.740
 fill a layer roughly on the side 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.120
 we help each other with a spoon or a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 brush and after that we will take 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.140
 the refrigerator with about 10 minutes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.240
 approximately for later 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 place the part of the filling of the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.470
 truffles we are going to stretch like this from this 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.470
 way there is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.290
 stretch and then we will take to the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 refrigerator for our ganache let's go 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.840
 to use in this case half a liter of 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.950
 cream of milk and half kilo in this case 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.470
 of milk chocolate in a pot we're going 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.990
 to bring to the fire and let's leave 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.899
 heat up a few seconds before 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 that boil meanwhile in a saucepan 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.670
 we have chocolate coverage 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.680
 heading into small pieces so that a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.130
 Once we have the cream of milk 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.899
 hot pour it here and move and do 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 so our desire since we have the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 milk so hot the cream 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 milk before opening it, let's go 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.660
 to empty here where we have the coverage 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.420
 of chocolate split into small 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.570
 pieces and we will wait a few 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.810
 instants and we will then move 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.470
 constantly in this way so that it 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.080
 go melting the chocolate and so 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.740
 have our ganache pasta and then 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.520
 let's take the network 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.080
 Now for a day we are moving from this 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.330
 shape 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.590
 and you are going to see that little by little 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.500
 will go dissolving the chocolate once 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.320
 that we have it already well dissolved we are going to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.099
 take to the refrigerator one day to 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.379
 another olate 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.219
 our chocolates and so will you remember 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:07.280
 a lighter chocolate love 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.980
 beating to create a thick cream with 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 the one that we're going to fill in these delicious 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.209
 chocolates 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 then once you have set the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.500
 first layer of chocolate coverage 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.290
 we have here in a disposable sleeve 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.530
 we have introduced the ganache cream 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:34.019
 whipped and we're going to fill the chocolate there 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:37.019
 is and then we are going to cover the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.160
 surface again with chocolate to 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.260
 take again to the refrigerator then 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.930
 We are filling with this soft filling 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.480
 which is what is normally used to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.799
 the truffles only that in this case 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.660
 we have beaten the win we are going to fill 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.510
 everything to then apply the following 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.980
 chocolate layer then once that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.030
 we have filled all the hearts of 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.160
 chocolate with the desire to shake we are going to 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.459
 add the last cap that is going to be the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.340
 which will cover these hearts we 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.569
 to cover the two like this and we're going to take 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.780
 the refrigerator for later 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.660
 this unmold the then we put 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.370
 so remember that the chocolate is not 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 very hot should not be hot from 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.009
 be this way a little thick because if 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.250
 it was hot it would melt the desire 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:34.759
 that are so but so delicate then 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.729
 we're going to put it like that and we 're going with the 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.990
 once it is full to the refrigerator 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:43.130
 until it sets well to be able 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.900
 dismantle once we have already 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.729
 disassembled was already in the refrigerator 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.949
 preferably in the freezer for 10 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.560
 we'll put it in a manga 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.080
 we have made a chocolate hole 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.570
 this one at a temperature 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.220
 it is warm the little one remember that 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.639
 with the heat of the hand it is loosening 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.060
 and we are going to make you any design 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.820
 we can make bandages and that depends 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.070
 of the taste of each one 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.180
 let's wait, look, so it's something 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.900
 we can do some waves there towards a 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.689
 side or we can do it in small squares 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.169
 that depends on him 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.330
 and you look, you can go 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.969
 decorating we can put a dot to a 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.299
 side 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:34.029
 there it is and the way you want 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:36.090
 you can go decorating your 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.910
 chocolates 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.180
 there it is fine we can make hairlines 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.520
 also just like that 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:48.479
 indistinctly they can go as well as a 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.889
 kind of doodles there is then 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.020
 we are decorating all the 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.940
 little hearts and then we take the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.500
 refrigerator to show them how they look 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.330
 I finish as you see here we already have those 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.790
 delicious chocolates filled with 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.800
 Heart shaped chocolate filled 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.240
