going to be very cool so yeah for the
drift<00:01:04.739> build<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.250> basically<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.840> pretty

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
drift build this is basically all pretty

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.760 
drift build this is basically all pretty
standard<00:01:07.590> stuff<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.720> basically<00:01:10.590> all

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
standard stuff it's it's basically all

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
standard stuff it's it's basically all
the<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:11.010> stuff<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.640> only<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the same stuff the only thing with this

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.359 
the same stuff the only thing with this
car<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> heavy

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
car is it's kind of heavy

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
car is it's kind of heavy
3000<00:01:15.270> pounds<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.630> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> heavy<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
3000 pounds it's kind of heavy so I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060 
3000 pounds it's kind of heavy so I
tried<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> only<00:01:17.700> install<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> power<00:01:19.680> mods

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tried to only install the power mods

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
tried to only install the power mods
that<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:21.090> make<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.630> lighter

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that actually make this a little lighter

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
that actually make this a little lighter
so<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:23.009> makes<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.310> lighter<00:01:23.520> yeah

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so I think this makes this lighter yeah

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
so I think this makes this lighter yeah
this<00:01:24.119> makes<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.390> later<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> exhaust<00:01:25.200> makes

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this makes this later the exhaust makes

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
this makes this later the exhaust makes
this<00:01:25.619> lighter<00:01:26.090> basically<00:01:27.090> things<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this lighter basically things like that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.460 
this lighter basically things like that
because<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.020> were<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> 3,000<00:01:29.549> pounds<00:01:29.820> car

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
because we were at a 3,000 pounds car

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
because we were at a 3,000 pounds car
three<00:01:31.470> thousand<00:01:31.770> pound<00:01:31.920> car<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.640> kind<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
three thousand pound car it's kind of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
three thousand pound car it's kind of
heavy<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.430> much

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
heavy and we really don't need that much

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
heavy and we really don't need that much
power<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> only<00:01:37.439> thing

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
power like I think that's the only thing

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
power like I think that's the only thing
I<00:01:37.650> toss<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> twin<00:01:38.850> turbo<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.630> usually

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I toss on is the twin turbo I usually

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.639 
I toss on is the twin turbo I usually
sit<00:01:40.740> around<00:01:40.979> 700<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.060> horsepower<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.500> let's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
sit around 700 or so horsepower so let's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
sit around 700 or so horsepower so let's
just<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.720> then<00:01:45.720> we'll<00:01:45.840> go

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
just get up to there and then we'll go

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
just get up to there and then we'll go
do<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.320> drifting<00:01:46.530> no<00:01:47.280> don't<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.820> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
do some drifting no don't have that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.819 
do some drifting no don't have that

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.800 
back in this summer that's what I'm most
likely<00:05:09.470> gonna<00:05:09.590> have<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.830> big<00:05:09.979> meet<00:05:10.159> up<00:05:10.810> around

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
likely gonna have a big meet up around

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.320 
likely gonna have a big meet up around
Brands<00:05:12.110> Hatch<00:05:12.229> probably<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.849> mean<00:05:14.000> that'd

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
Brands Hatch probably that mean that'd

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.629 
Brands Hatch probably that mean that'd
be<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.659> best<00:05:15.050> idea<00:05:15.349> I<00:05:15.560> think<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:16.009> you<00:05:16.520> guys

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
be the best idea I think and you guys

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.790 
be the best idea I think and you guys
can<00:05:16.819> all<00:05:16.880> watch<00:05:17.060> me<00:05:17.270> drive<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.229> real<00:05:18.409> life<00:05:18.620> and

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
can all watch me drive in real life and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.070 
can all watch me drive in real life and
probably<00:05:19.000> hopefully<00:05:20.000> not<00:05:20.150> crash<00:05:20.389> a<00:05:20.419> real<00:05:20.659> m3

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
probably hopefully not crash a real m3

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.749 
probably hopefully not crash a real m3
that'd<00:05:21.289> be<00:05:21.380> bad<00:05:21.620> would<00:05:22.400> make<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.729> some

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
that'd be bad would make for some

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.790 
that'd be bad would make for some
amazing<00:05:23.419> video<00:05:23.630> footage<00:05:23.930> though<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:24.740> I

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
amazing video footage though so I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.550 
amazing video footage though so I
actually<00:05:25.039> crashed<00:05:25.430> them<00:05:25.639> three<00:05:26.409> that'd<00:05:27.409> be

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
actually crashed them three that'd be

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.779
