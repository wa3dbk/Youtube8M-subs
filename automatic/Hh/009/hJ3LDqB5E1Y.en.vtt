00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360 

I<00:00:00.210> think<00:00:00.630> brining<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.230> great<00:00:01.650> way<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.010> get

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I think brining is a great way to get

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.559 
I think brining is a great way to get
really<00:00:02.850> moist<00:00:03.240> tender<00:00:04.549> and<00:00:05.549> here's<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> do

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
really moist tender and here's how to do

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.890 
really moist tender and here's how to do
it<00:00:06.620> you<00:00:07.620> want<00:00:07.770> about<00:00:07.830> two<00:00:08.220> quarts<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.150> water

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
it you want about two quarts of water

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.440 
it you want about two quarts of water
and<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.700> use<00:00:11.730> kosher<00:00:12.210> salt

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and for this you have to use kosher salt

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.519 
and for this you have to use kosher salt
because<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.710> no<00:00:14.309> additives<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> need

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
because it has no additives so you need

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.150 
because it has no additives so you need
a<00:00:16.859> half<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> cup<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.150> kosher<00:00:18.420> salt<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:19.350> two

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
a half a cup of kosher salt in two

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.689 
a half a cup of kosher salt in two
quarts<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> water<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.400> want<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
quarts of water and to this you want to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.000 
quarts of water and to this you want to
add<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> quarter<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.600> cup<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.109> sugar

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
add a quarter of a cup of sugar

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910 
add a quarter of a cup of sugar
so<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> goes<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.720> now<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.019> brining<00:00:28.650> pork

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
so all that goes in now for brining pork

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
so all that goes in now for brining pork
chops<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> put<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.349> day

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
chops if you're going to put on the day

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
chops if you're going to put on the day
that<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> cook<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> pork<00:00:33.239> chops

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that you want to cook the pork chops

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.150 
that you want to cook the pork chops
you're<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.800> several

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
you're gonna have to do this several

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.459 
you're gonna have to do this several
hours<00:00:35.760> ahead<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.360> time<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> fine<00:00:37.440> line

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
hours ahead of time there's a fine line

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.000 
hours ahead of time there's a fine line
between<00:00:38.239> when<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> pork<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.899> over<00:00:40.379> brined<00:00:40.710> or

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
between when the pork is over brined or

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.700 
between when the pork is over brined or
under<00:00:41.610> brined<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> mix<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.530> all

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
under brined so you mix that all

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.490 
under brined so you mix that all
together<00:00:43.890> until<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.579> dissolves<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
together until it dissolves and that is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
together until it dissolves and that is
a<00:00:46.530> basic<00:00:47.070> brine<00:00:48.530> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> want<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> put<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
a basic brine if you want to put it in a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.000 
a basic brine if you want to put it in a
plastic<00:00:50.850> bag<00:00:51.410> because<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
plastic bag because now you have to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
plastic bag because now you have to
transfer<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> bag<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
transfer this into a bag and I think a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
transfer this into a bag and I think a
bag<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> easy<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.370> because

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
bag is the easy way to do this because

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.529 
bag is the easy way to do this because
then<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.510> back<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.160> shake<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> pork

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then you can go back and shake the pork

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
then you can go back and shake the pork
chops<00:01:00.840> from<00:01:01.109> time<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.559> time<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
chops from time to time so that it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.130 
chops from time to time so that it's
evenly<00:01:02.969> coated<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> add<00:01:06.869> those

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
evenly coated and then you add those

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
evenly coated and then you add those
pork<00:01:07.500> chops<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.760> mine<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:11.810> these

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pork chops so there are mine and these

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
pork chops so there are mine and these
are<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.500> thick<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.430> one<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
are really thick these are one and a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.560 
are really thick these are one and a
half<00:01:15.240> inch<00:01:15.680> thick<00:01:16.680> pork<00:01:17.040> chops<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.360> only

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
half inch thick pork chops so you only

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
half inch thick pork chops so you only
need<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> these<00:01:19.500> per<00:01:20.220> serving<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> could

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
need one of these per serving you could

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
need one of these per serving you could
probably<00:01:21.210> even<00:01:21.600> share<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.049> somebody<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
probably even share it with somebody so

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
probably even share it with somebody so
get<00:01:23.009> them<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> bag<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.500> then<00:01:28.500> close

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
get them all in the bag and then close

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.810 
get them all in the bag and then close
the<00:01:29.430> bag<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.990> seal<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.820> because

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the bag up really seal it well because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.100 
the bag up really seal it well because
now<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
now you have to put this in the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.160 
now you have to put this in the
refrigerator<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.390> then<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:37.650> take<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
refrigerator and then I take them and I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
refrigerator and then I take them and I
put<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.130> flat<00:01:41.549> dish<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:43.280> pyrex<00:01:44.280> dish<00:01:44.750> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
put them in a flat dish a pyrex dish you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.030 
put them in a flat dish a pyrex dish you
could<00:01:45.899> leave<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> bowl<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.770> but

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
could leave them in a bowl like this but

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.450 
could leave them in a bowl like this but
I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> much<00:01:47.729> better<00:01:49.280> lay<00:01:50.280> them

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I think this is much better lay them

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.880 
I think this is much better lay them
down<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.750> time<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.200> time<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.740> going

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
down and from time to time you're going

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.969 
down and from time to time you're going
to<00:01:52.979> shake<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:53.759> side<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.060> side<00:01:54.619> how<00:01:55.619> long

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to shake them from side to side how long

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.899 
to shake them from side to side how long
do<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> brine<00:01:56.880> pork<00:01:57.450> chops<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.909> from

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
do you brine pork chops like this from

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.840 
do you brine pork chops like this from
two<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.780> four<00:02:01.020> hours<00:02:01.530> let<00:02:02.369> me<00:02:02.430> tell<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.700> what

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
two to four hours let me tell you what

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
two to four hours let me tell you what
we're<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.780> once<00:02:04.469> they're

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
we're going to do with them once they're

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.150 
we're going to do with them once they're
bright<00:02:05.750> we're<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.229> cook<00:02:07.770> them<00:02:07.979> as

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
bright we're going to cook them as

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.669 
bright we're going to cook them as
breaded<00:02:09.119> pork<00:02:09.479> chops

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
breaded pork chops

really starts to spark right away then I

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.660 
really starts to spark right away then I
know<00:06:26.030> that<00:06:26.210> that<00:06:26.539> oil<00:06:26.780> you

know that that oil you
hot<00:06:27.970> enough<00:06:28.240> so<00:06:28.570> turn<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.410> or<00:06:29.560> turn<00:06:29.920> the<00:06:30.130> heat

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
hot enough so turn the or turn the heat

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
way up and we want to get a nice crust

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.640 
way up and we want to get a nice crust
on<00:06:34.540> these<00:06:35.550> and<00:06:36.550> we<00:06:36.640> take<00:06:36.910> our<00:06:37.090> chops<00:06:37.510> they<00:06:38.500> are

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
on these and we take our chops they are

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:48.120 
on these and we take our chops they are
gorgeous<00:06:39.810> and<00:06:41.430> put<00:06:42.430> them<00:06:42.580> in<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:42.760> pan

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:55.210 

huh<00:06:50.200> don't<00:06:51.200> crowd<00:06:51.830> them<00:06:53.560> if<00:06:54.560> you<00:06:54.710> can't<00:06:54.980> fit

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
huh don't crowd them if you can't fit

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.070 
huh don't crowd them if you can't fit
them<00:06:55.400> all<00:06:55.520> in<00:06:55.880> then<00:06:56.090> cook<00:06:56.330> a<00:06:56.450> couple<00:06:56.690> at<00:06:56.960> a<00:06:56.990> time

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
them all in then cook a couple at a time

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.540 
them all in then cook a couple at a time
but<00:06:57.710> I<00:06:57.890> think<00:06:58.190> these<00:06:58.280> are<00:06:58.460> going<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:58.640> fit<00:06:59.410> and

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
but I think these are going to fit and

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.520 
but I think these are going to fit and
they<00:07:01.550> do<00:07:02.770> so<00:07:03.770> we<00:07:03.860> want<00:07:04.070> to<00:07:04.130> let<00:07:04.250> those<00:07:04.490> cook

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
they do so we want to let those cook

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.660 
they do so we want to let those cook
until<00:07:06.530> their<00:07:06.710> custody<00:07:07.160> on<00:07:07.400> the<00:07:07.660> underside
