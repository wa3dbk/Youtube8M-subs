00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.560

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.240
 saying 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.380
 you believe that now because it comes out 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.170

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.320
 to stop playing in the old 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.340
 generation worth ps3 I mean in 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.020
 our case, I do not answer in my 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.720
 name and in the name of other youtuber 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.750
 that we will not stop uploading content 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.620
 of ps3 that now this week to see 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.290

00:00:52.330 --> 00:01:00.500
 see what I explain in us 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.040
 we thought that upload videos to see how 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.590
 I explain this because it is difficult to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.560
 reading I find it difficult to express what 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.310
 what I think you think 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.159
 we upload a video and that ale 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 It is uploaded to see who wants to not 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.509
 I care your opinion for that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.280
 I always say, leave me in the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.220

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.080
 and if you like to give him the ecta I always 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.399
 I always ask you if you do what 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.950
 what do you think what you think 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.759

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.280
 a delay give it to me but they explain why 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.250
 in the comment because you do not like the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.270
 video because it's my opinion is very 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.979
 important 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.069

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.110

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.409
 very important to me and I say it 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.569

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.880

 death with you in ps3 but in pc 4 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.600
 you also have to understand that 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.680
 in a while the ps3 then it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.210
 It will be obsolete and well, I do not want 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.070
 say that we will stop playing and 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.290
 means that I'm going to keep giving him 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.780
 cane but to the two platforms ps3 and pc 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.270

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.180
 that your opinion is very important and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.080
 if I upload 4 pc videos just for 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.580
 have visits because it does not motivate me 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.230
 It motivates me to tell me in the comments 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.450
 that I liked this video because of this 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.680
 I'm this hey, I'm so happy 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.980
 heap my eggs fall to the ground 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.090
 and that is that I feel happy as I 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.150
 I feel happy when there is some 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.920
 comment that people tell me 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.959
 I also put them just to put 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.930
 twitter the comments that come to me 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.220

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.260

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.409

 love uncle because I feel that what 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.519
 I'm doing is good for something and although 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.620
 It does not serve to earn what I want or 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.230
 does not serve to reach people who 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.829
 I want that subscriber to that guy to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.299
 that girl has got the video and I 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.299
 come to me you know what 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.710
 6 good that laugh with my video or that 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.700
 I had a good time and I enjoyed watching it 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.670
 I'm going to tell you one thing, one anecdote 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.960
 It's worth as many of you will know 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.530
 we were at an event at an event in 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.690
 elche and in that event I met a 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.060
 Subscriber is worth 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.389
 is the subscriber 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.560
 He was telling me that although he saw everything 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.900
 my video such 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.370
 also the strata what are missing and 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.770
 Of course there are many people who see our 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:42.530
 videos but of course then he approached his 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.930
 mother and approached to speak with me and I 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.080
 he said what 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.550
 that when his son told him to go to 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.760
 event 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.760
 her mother she told her from her mother take me out 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.210
 an outstanding in the next exam and 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.080
 I take you to see it and took it out 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.920
 according to outstanding and I get that 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.330
 why 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.560
 if you propose something, you get it 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.100
 it costs you what it costs but what 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.100
 get to the end 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.490
 and the comment I know your mother made me 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.009
 It took me a lot that you get good 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.900
 notes for want to go see us or that's it 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.680
 I'm happy and then I was also 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.229
 counting that your child is not or is not 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.060
 where a kid that has to be 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.460
 small and that is not being a 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.639
 big boy 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.979
 He told me how good his son was 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.800
 He threw threw himself after studying the 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.630
 couch to watch our videos and it was split 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.819
 he started laughing with our videos and 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.520
 what I want to say with this is that I 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.289
 Glad that makes me happy to know that makes me happy 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.979
 know that people and enjoy with my 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:01.550
 videos and good with those of my classmates 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.440
 because it's something that does not make us full 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.889
 that fills us with joy at least 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.509
 for me I know that yesterday I said on twitter that 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.509
 if it reached 75 thousand subscribers 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:19.130
 I would make some video or some video opening 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.200
 least if we get 35 thousand I'll do something 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.210
 special but what I wanted to tell you is this 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.130
 night is worth it because I'm watching this video 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.870
 doing at quarter to ten 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.660
 I'll go up now to the aunt I guess what 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.590
 I'll have climbed alone have the rooms here 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.590
 in Spain 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.370

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.830

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.990
