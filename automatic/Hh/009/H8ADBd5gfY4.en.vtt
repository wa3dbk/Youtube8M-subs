microphones<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.600> could<00:01:51.750> even<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.140> adapter

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
microphones we could even get an adapter

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
microphones we could even get an adapter
put<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> AC<00:01:54.060> adapter<00:01:54.420> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
put more in we have the AC adapter that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
put more in we have the AC adapter that
plugs<00:01:54.930> into<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> wall<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.890> never<00:01:56.100> run<00:01:56.340> out

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
plugs into the wall so we never run out

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.280 
plugs into the wall so we never run out
of<00:01:56.520> battery<00:01:56.909> power<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.990> use

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
of battery power for this and we use

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
of battery power for this and we use
this<00:01:58.530> thing<00:01:58.799> each<00:01:59.070> week<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> where<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this thing each week this is where the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.480 
this thing each week this is where the
levels<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> set<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> sits<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.369> on

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
levels are set and it sits over here on

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.560 
levels are set and it sits over here on
my<00:02:02.640> counter<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.020> happens<00:02:04.520> boom<00:02:05.570> we

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
my counter that's what happens boom we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.789 
my counter that's what happens boom we
might<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.780> well<00:02:06.810> move<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> Atomos

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
might as well move over to the Atomos

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.210 
might as well move over to the Atomos
Steven<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.209> we've<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.140> Atomos<00:02:10.649> ninja<00:02:11.039> 2

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
Steven so we've got the Atomos ninja 2

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.619 
Steven so we've got the Atomos ninja 2
which<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.700> we've<00:02:11.910> been<00:02:11.940> using<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:12.599> now

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
which is what we've been using right now

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.660 
which is what we've been using right now
we're<00:02:12.989> testing<00:02:13.379> out

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we're testing out

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.970 
we're testing out
this<00:02:14.670> allows<00:02:15.030> us<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.269> leave<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.750> d800<00:02:16.500> angle

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
this allows us to leave the d800 angle

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.550 
this allows us to leave the d800 angle
with<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> 14<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> 24<00:02:18.599> which<00:02:18.810> today<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.290> had<00:02:19.440> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
with a 14 to 24 which today we had it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.559 
with a 14 to 24 which today we had it
set<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.890> 20<00:02:20.190> millimeters<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.450> we're

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
set at 20 millimeters because we're

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.180 
set at 20 millimeters because we're
trying<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.080> things<00:02:22.260> better<00:02:22.530> we're<00:02:23.010> trying

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
trying to do things better we're trying

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.500 
trying to do things better we're trying
to<00:02:23.310> remember<00:02:23.489> where<00:02:23.670> everything's<00:02:24.090> set<00:02:24.480> up

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
to remember where everything's set up

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
to remember where everything's set up
Steven<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.989> should<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> shot<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.830> can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
Steven you should get a shot so we can

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.050 
Steven you should get a shot so we can
go<00:02:26.099> back<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.280> watch<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:26.940> where

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
go back and watch and see where

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.119 
go back and watch and see where
everything's<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:28.409> we<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> Atomos

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
everything's at so we have the Atomos

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.770 
everything's at so we have the Atomos
which<00:02:29.310> allows<00:02:29.549> us<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.849> record<00:02:30.120> right<00:02:30.510> off<00:02:30.750> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
which allows us to record right off of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.559 
which allows us to record right off of
the<00:02:31.079> sensor<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.010> we<00:02:32.159> can<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.060> reset

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
the sensor so we can not have to reset

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.479 
the sensor so we can not have to reset
this<00:02:33.810> camera<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.680> love<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.340> its

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
this camera we love it it's on its

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.410 
this camera we love it it's on its
Vanguard<00:02:35.879> tripod<00:02:36.709> d800<00:02:37.709> let's<00:02:38.310> take<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> step

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
Vanguard tripod d800 let's take a step

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.509 
Vanguard tripod d800 let's take a step
back<00:02:39.720> over<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.530> angle<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.010> this

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
back over here this is the angle so this

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.339 
back over here this is the angle so this
is<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> angle<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.180> records<00:02:45.599> me<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.959> have<00:02:46.170> my

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
is the angle that records me I have my

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.710 
is the angle that records me I have my
d4<00:02:46.799> on<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.430> every<00:02:47.879> week<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.510> for

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
d4 on here so every week this is on for

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780 
d4 on here so every week this is on for
almost<00:02:48.840> an<00:02:49.049> hour<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> half<00:02:49.709> recording<00:02:50.670> we

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
almost an hour and a half recording we

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.849 
almost an hour and a half recording we
get<00:02:50.940> 20<00:02:51.329> minutes<00:02:51.629> at<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.810> time<00:02:52.049> with<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
get 20 minutes at a time with this

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.099 
get 20 minutes at a time with this
camera<00:02:53.160> that's<00:02:53.549> why<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.329> up<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.660> reset<00:02:55.049> it

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
camera that's why we get up and reset it

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.500 
camera that's why we get up and reset it
until<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:55.799> decide<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.459> we're<00:02:56.609> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
until we decide if we're going to have a

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.569 
until we decide if we're going to have a
live<00:02:58.290> switch<00:02:58.680> or<00:02:58.859> capability<00:02:59.430> which

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
live switch or capability which

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.099 
live switch or capability which
hopefully<00:02:59.819> one<00:03:00.180> day<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.510> get<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.079> that

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
hopefully one day we get to but that

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.930 
hopefully one day we get to but that
means<00:03:01.200> bringing<00:03:01.590> more<00:03:01.829> people<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.549> that's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
means bringing more people in and that's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.729 
means bringing more people in and that's
okay<00:03:03.329> if<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:03.989> this<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.200> my<00:03:04.379> angle

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
okay if we do that but this is my angle

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.759 
okay if we do that but this is my angle

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
on my manfrotto tripod stephen can you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.530 
on my manfrotto tripod stephen can you
pan<00:03:14.159> up<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.459> there<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.819> see<00:03:15.000> what<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.299> did<00:03:15.450> with

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
pan up to there and see what we did with

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.140 
pan up to there and see what we did with
the<00:03:15.599> GoPro<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:17.190> recent<00:03:17.669> stephen<00:03:17.940> had<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the GoPro and recent stephen had the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.370 
the GoPro and recent stephen had the
idea<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.510> we<00:03:18.690> show<00:03:18.900> something<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.349> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
idea that we show something like a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.039 
idea that we show something like a
security<00:03:19.799> camera<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.819> we<00:03:20.940> put<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.239> GoPro<00:03:21.780> up

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
security camera and we put the GoPro up

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.509 
security camera and we put the GoPro up
there<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.530> give<00:03:22.650> us<00:03:22.739> an<00:03:22.859> ultra<00:03:23.310> wide-angle

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
there to give us an ultra wide-angle

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.379 
there to give us an ultra wide-angle
look<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.299> an<00:03:24.780> overview<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.769> that's<00:03:26.160> um<00:03:26.489> the

Stevens<00:03:37.139> angle<00:03:37.560> goes<00:03:37.709> whether<00:03:38.040> right<00:03:38.370> now

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
Stevens angle goes whether right now

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.309 
Stevens angle goes whether right now
we've<00:03:38.730> been<00:03:38.849> using<00:03:39.000> his<00:03:39.269> camera<00:03:39.750> we've<00:03:40.200> been

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
over here are so much better we've got a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.190 
over here are so much better we've got a
four<00:04:44.350> banger<00:04:44.620> over<00:04:45.070> there<00:04:45.250> that's<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.640> that's

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
four banger over there that's a that's

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.890 
four banger over there that's a that's
44<00:04:47.200> footlights<00:04:47.770> we've<00:04:48.340> got<00:04:48.550> four<00:04:48.970> more<00:04:49.510> four

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
44 footlights we've got four more four

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.870 
44 footlights we've got four more four
footlights<00:04:50.350> letting<00:04:50.710> us<00:04:50.800> up<00:04:50.950> right<00:04:51.010> here<00:04:51.460> and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
footlights letting us up right here and

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.880 
footlights letting us up right here and
then<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.120> just<00:04:52.150> put<00:04:52.480> on<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.720> background<00:04:52.990> which

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
then we just put on the background which

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.010 
then we just put on the background which
made<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> huge<00:04:54.670> difference<00:04:54.910> in<00:04:55.210> separation<00:04:55.750> the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
made a huge difference in separation the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.330 
made a huge difference in separation the
contrast<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.710> two<00:04:57.580> by<00:04:57.820> two<00:04:58.570> by<00:04:59.080> two<00:04:59.380> there's<00:05:00.250> two

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
contrast a two by two by two there's two

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.980 
contrast a two by two by two there's two
and<00:05:00.669> we<00:05:00.730> are<00:05:00.850> using<00:05:01.000> all<00:05:01.180> day<00:05:01.390> light<00:05:01.600> bulbs

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
and we are using all day light bulbs

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.390 
and we are using all day light bulbs
they're<00:05:02.169> all<00:05:02.320> daylight<00:05:02.650> balanced<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:03.370> that

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
they're all daylight balanced so that

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.670 
they're all daylight balanced so that
focuses<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.240> on<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.450> background<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.169> allows

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
focuses in on the background and allows

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.310 
focuses in on the background and allows
us<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:06.190> separate<00:05:07.150> me<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.630> contrast<00:05:08.110> look

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
us to separate me and the contrast look

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.700 
us to separate me and the contrast look
so<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:10.120> much<00:05:10.330> better<00:05:10.570> Kino<00:05:11.169> flows<00:05:11.410> or<00:05:11.590> what

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
so so so much better Kino flows or what

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.770 
so so so much better Kino flows or what
many<00:05:12.040> studios<00:05:12.430> use<00:05:12.820> when<00:05:13.300> they're<00:05:13.419> shooting

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780
