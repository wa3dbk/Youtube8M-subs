00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
all right now we're getting to

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.189 
all right now we're getting to
little<00:00:17.769> bit<00:00:17.890> more<00:00:18.240> complex<00:00:19.240> type<00:00:19.689> of<00:00:19.900> soul

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
little bit more complex type of soul

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.189 
little bit more complex type of soul
making<00:00:20.710> we<00:00:21.609> have<00:00:21.669> one<00:00:21.880> like<00:00:22.090> like<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:23.019> one<00:00:23.169> I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
making we have one like like this one I

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.490 
making we have one like like this one I
really<00:00:23.289> like<00:00:23.590> this<00:00:23.859> one<00:00:24.039> a<00:00:24.099> lot<00:00:24.279> actually<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
really like this one a lot actually it

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.509 
really like this one a lot actually it
is<00:00:26.680> also<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:28.090> two<00:00:29.009> different<00:00:30.009> types<00:00:30.220> of

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
is also just two different types of

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.299 
is also just two different types of
fabric<00:00:31.090> glued<00:00:31.570> together<00:00:31.779> first<00:00:32.320> like<00:00:32.920> this

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
fabric glued together first like this

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.840 
fabric glued together first like this
I<00:00:33.930> used<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:35.110> denim<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:35.739> this<00:00:35.980> filter<00:00:36.339> rule<00:00:36.699> that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
I used a denim and this filter rule that

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.630 
I used a denim and this filter rule that
I<00:00:36.909> had<00:00:37.180> it's<00:00:37.780> glued<00:00:38.140> together<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:39.430> time

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
I had it's glued together and this time

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.899 
I had it's glued together and this time
I<00:00:39.670> stitched<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.540> by<00:00:40.809> Machine<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.629> just

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
I stitched it by Machine and then I just

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.609 
I stitched it by Machine and then I just
done<00:00:45.909> it<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.150> strips<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:48.780> tried<00:00:49.780> out<00:00:49.809> first<00:00:50.320> what

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
done it in strips I tried out first what

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.679 
done it in strips I tried out first what
widths<00:00:51.900> would<00:00:52.900> would<00:00:53.470> end<00:00:53.680> up<00:00:53.799> being<00:00:54.189> what<00:00:55.000> you

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:55.689 
widths would would end up being what you

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.740 
widths would would end up being what you
know<00:00:55.780> how<00:00:56.110> wide<00:00:56.379> a<00:00:56.879> braid<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.119> this<00:00:58.510> just

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
know how wide a braid is this just

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.439 
know how wide a braid is this just
braided<00:00:59.140> with<00:00:59.290> three<00:01:00.839> strips<00:01:02.939> so<00:01:03.939> I<00:01:03.970> made<00:01:04.239> a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
braided with three strips so I made a

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.940 
braided with three strips so I made a
really<00:01:04.629> long<00:01:04.869> braid<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.840> then<00:01:08.710> I

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
really long braid like that and then I

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.190 
really long braid like that and then I
sewed<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.450> onto<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.430> sole<00:01:12.790> as<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:14.020> can

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
sewed it right onto this sole as you can

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.749 
sewed it right onto this sole as you can
see<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.830> started<00:01:15.759> here<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:17.829> went<00:01:18.040> around

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
see I started here and I went around

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:26.450 
see I started here and I went around
like<00:01:19.720> this<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:23.820> used<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:25.030> sturdy<00:01:25.720> thread

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
like this I used a very sturdy thread

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.700 
like this I used a very sturdy thread
which<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.640> important<00:01:28.360> obviously<00:01:28.780> making

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
which is important obviously making

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.850 
which is important obviously making
shoes<00:01:30.060> anything<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.900> would<00:01:32.230> say<00:01:32.470> is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
shoes anything that I would say is

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.800 
shoes anything that I would say is
strong<00:01:33.190> enough<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:33.820> really<00:01:34.180> can't<00:01:34.420> rip<00:01:34.659> it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
strong enough so you really can't rip it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.800 
strong enough so you really can't rip it
apart<00:01:34.930> with<00:01:35.740> your<00:01:35.800> hands<00:01:36.280> should<00:01:37.240> work<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
apart with your hands should work in the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.300 
apart with your hands should work in the
very<00:01:40.990> end<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.229> also<00:01:41.409> use<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.800> blanket<00:01:42.190> stitch

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
very end I also use the blanket stitch

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.380 
very end I also use the blanket stitch
to<00:01:42.700> stitch<00:01:42.760> it<00:01:43.090> down<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.700> every<00:01:46.180> single

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
to stitch it down but it is every single

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.850 
to stitch it down but it is every single
braid<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.620> stitched<00:01:48.040> down<00:01:48.479> onto<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.710> this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
braid is stitched down onto this so this

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.740 
braid is stitched down onto this so this
is<00:01:51.010> going<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.220> be<00:01:51.340> what<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.610> walk<00:01:51.820> on<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.360> this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
is going to be what you walk on and this

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.180 
is going to be what you walk on and this
is<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.200> be<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.320> inside<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> your<00:01:53.950> shoe

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
is going to be the inside of your shoe

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.190 
is going to be the inside of your shoe
and<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.770> also<00:01:57.100> padded<00:01:57.700> very<00:01:57.880> nicely<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.540> think

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and it's also padded very nicely I think

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.580 
and it's also padded very nicely I think
I'm<00:01:59.320> going<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.530> like<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.860> one<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.369> then<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
I'm going to like this one and then we

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.530 
I'm going to like this one and then we
have<00:02:05.680> something<00:02:06.040> very<00:02:06.070> similar<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.330> you're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
have something very similar but you're

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.499 
have something very similar but you're
not<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.990> be<00:02:08.080> braiding<00:02:08.590> anything<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
not going to be braiding anything it is

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.619 
not going to be braiding anything it is
again<00:02:10.840> two<00:02:11.530> layers<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.010> fabric<00:02:12.610> together<00:02:13.180> this

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
again two layers of fabric together this

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.720 
again two layers of fabric together this
time<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.170> used<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.890> bias<00:02:15.250> tape<00:02:16.980> around<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.250> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
time I used a bias tape around it so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.330 
time I used a bias tape around it so
that<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.599> get<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> nicer<00:02:20.230> edge<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:21.099> know<00:02:21.220> if

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
that you get a nicer edge you know if

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490 
that you get a nicer edge you know if
you<00:02:21.430> saw<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:21.939> this<00:02:22.299> one<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.840> edge<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.230> not

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
you saw it in this one the edge is not

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.270 
you saw it in this one the edge is not
that<00:02:23.799> great<00:02:24.180> also<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:26.260> one<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:27.130> know<00:02:27.220> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that great also on this one you know you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.589 
that great also on this one you know you
might<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:28.090> might<00:02:28.120> see<00:02:28.630> that

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
might you might see that

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.330 
might you might see that
that<00:02:29.989> edge<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.530> end<00:02:30.680> product<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.159> not

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that edge in the end product and not

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.399 
that edge in the end product and not
like<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.629> is<00:02:32.689> going<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.079> make<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.319> a

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
like it so this is going to make it a

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.250 
like it so this is going to make it a
little<00:02:33.590> smoother<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:36.019> then<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:37.099> used<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
little smoother and then I used this

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.059 
little smoother and then I used this
rope<00:02:39.560> which<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:39.980> actually<00:02:40.430> meant<00:02:40.670> for<00:02:42.069> hanging

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
rope which is actually meant for hanging

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.069 
rope which is actually meant for hanging
laundry<00:02:43.249> and<00:02:45.879> without<00:02:46.879> braiding<00:02:47.359> it<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.780> just

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
laundry and without braiding it you just

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.289 
laundry and without braiding it you just
as<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:50.030> stitch<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.340> onto<00:02:52.340> your<00:02:52.489> shoe<00:02:52.790> like

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
as you see stitch it onto your shoe like

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.659 
as you see stitch it onto your shoe like
this<00:02:53.329> onto<00:02:53.959> your<00:02:53.989> soul<00:02:56.919> I'd<00:02:57.919> say<00:02:58.129> it<00:02:58.250> takes<00:02:58.400> all

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
this onto your soul I'd say it takes all

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.309 
this onto your soul I'd say it takes all
of<00:02:58.819> it<00:02:58.939> everything<00:02:59.540> takes<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.139> same

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
of it everything takes that the same

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.330 
of it everything takes that the same
amount<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.680> time<00:03:00.919> it's<00:03:01.689> I<00:03:02.769> don't<00:03:03.769> know<00:03:03.829> one<00:03:04.129> two

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
amount of time it's I don't know one two

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.349 
amount of time it's I don't know one two
hours<00:03:04.790> depending<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.719> how<00:03:05.930> quick<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.409> are

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
hours depending on how quick you are

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.270 
hours depending on how quick you are
obviously<00:03:08.359> it's<00:03:08.510> all<00:03:08.659> hand<00:03:08.959> sewn<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.980> yeah

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
obviously it's all hand sewn so yeah

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.750 
obviously it's all hand sewn so yeah
it's<00:03:10.879> not<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.480> fastest<00:03:11.900> thing<00:03:12.109> ever

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
it's not the fastest thing ever

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.280 
it's not the fastest thing ever
but<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.269> also<00:03:14.389> neat<00:03:14.719> and<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.079> think

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
but this one is also neat and I think

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.399 
but this one is also neat and I think
it's<00:03:15.409> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.680> very<00:03:15.829> durable<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:18.109> you

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
it's going to be very durable this you

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.059 
it's going to be very durable this you
know<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.829> could<00:03:18.980> even<00:03:19.099> go<00:03:19.310> out<00:03:19.459> in<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.669> garden

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
know you could even go out in the garden

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.299 
know you could even go out in the garden
bring<00:03:22.069> out<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.310> garbage<00:03:22.790> or<00:03:22.909> something
