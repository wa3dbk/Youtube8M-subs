00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 such and we return live 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.990
 until Argés where Juli is ready 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.929
 to fish with a very modality 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.300
 particular the car fishing that juli 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.840
 It requires very 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.790
 particular 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.020
 I was trying to castrate that yes but 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.020
 I see that I can fish from here 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:33.720
 to signal the post and for you 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.720
 that with this they can know the depth 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.989
 and notice why we are going to mount the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.460
 camping or camping device that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.830
 it is impressive what is mounted here 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.860
 With the karting I ask you still present 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.840
 to our good friend richard besides if 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.980
 they want to hear of course I 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.230
 I want only to stop me here that to me 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.579
 I really like the bat and neo and check and 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.620
 observe everything you have here in this 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.210
 way we save the elements 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 of our modality which are the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 rooms more features yes yes yes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.299
 we have passed an individual that is what 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.909
 what will he do to us and if the action of the 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.220
 light to indicate is doing because 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 it is prohibited then one hour before 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.140
 of the sunrise and the rest of the equipment 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.610
 being all the small items 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.280
 to do our assembly of our 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.520
 bass and hooks you have to have a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 car 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.869
 apart also yes yes of course 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.270
 because this is more thread and style with 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.270
 Lead weapon to stay 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.020
 so that our under us does not 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.760
 eliminate with which also viable 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 It is also viable and for example 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 we will be with a point like this is the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.070
 fundamental tool of the case and without 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.300
 because it 's to transport for 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.230
 pass the bait and connect the hacker to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.630
 our viewers that sure what 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.880
 know is the fishing modality without 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 death comes from england was born in the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.380
 year one thousand 178 and see if it has evolved 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.210
 pull things that are prepared more 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.310
 little things here is the food of those 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.600
 fish that do not die gentlemen simply 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.220
 they prove that we have to eat this 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.720
 small these are pressed flours and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.490
 boiled with more water to last 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.530
 many hours our bait was immersed in 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.580
 the water is called bowling because it comes 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.580
 from the verb boil 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.880
 We have different colors and flavors 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.620
 well as depending on the composition of 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.180
 the flours are salty they are sweet 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.299
 they can be mixed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.489
 This is a bait in square shape 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.650
 change the format the presentation that 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.780
 is a produces is based on flour 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.370
 chufa maize flour fish meal 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.840
 in this case all sweet 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.340
 once we have prepared the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.260
 food we would have to ride those 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.939
 reeds that will be watching you and that 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.980
 our friend oscar is riding them 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.719
 I'm going to approach Oscar 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.519
 I want to ask another partner jose 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.780
 bring us the umbrella we have the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.469
 prepared desire 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.150
 and we have to with the 360 with I had no challenge 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.299
 provocative for having given to start 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.030
 to fish place ladies and gentlemen give me 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.439
 a bait that I'm going to eat I 'm going 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.870
 to eat me Canarian companies 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:29.069
 they also open the umbrella that you do not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.069
 You want me to be almost six gentlemen 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.150
 good for you I do not know if they will have 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.150
 left in the next live 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.530
 then you tell us to see how you are doing 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.840
 juli hill here from advertising we have 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.239
 left juli ready to fish with 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.370
 that new modality that is karting 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.280
 so let's go back to the swamp of 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.400
 Argés where Juli and I see you there in full 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.560
 work in full slaughter and tampa in which 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.540
 we just fish we do not know what it is and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.519
 This really has no trap or cardboard 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.640
 the friend heart is going to start rolling 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.790
 the reel of the cane that does not get wet 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:17.190
 first stop of a tent to be a 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.709
 tent in the tests but I want to put 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.720
 to the reel continue that we are in 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.760
 an average fishing season but there 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 to say that you never know this about the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.050
 fishing in the end is a miracle the fish 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.790
 they have heard the call of wide gesture 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.530
 already the spot has come to say hello 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.700
 it has been poured and I put myself in the middle 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.400
 you have to get very in the middle of this 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.680
 fishing we are live or this is 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.969
 is the direct directísimo while 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.300
 is coming look 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.289
 and there we have what it is 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.560
 is a folder in this reservoir true of 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.620
 argés is enough because if 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.470
 inhabits a large population inhabits a 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.800
 large population of tents tents 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.379
 Size from 2 kilos to 8 10 12 14 kilos 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.419
 but the most normal thing is the tents in the 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.400
 carpfishing name medicine 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.620
 casba and death there we have as well 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.539
 prepared that network is how is prepared to 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.030
 the fishermen these fishermen 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:16.289
 also very loving of nature that 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.900
 what they always want to contribute to 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.580
 phishing is the word that is said 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.300
 we have our letter caught and now 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.000
 what we are going to do 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.319
 see how they take care here 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.100
 the animals how the 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.200
 nature and now they will call 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.910
 when it comes to calling justice we are going to 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.920
 take a pool now this is 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.210
 incredible how they ride it and how good 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.490
 that these fishermen behave with 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 nature meanwhile richard is 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.400
 pouring water into the natural pool that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.800
 we have prepared to protect 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.180
 our tent so the mucus that 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.560
 having the fish that this what they do 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.150
 is to avoid infections then 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.620
 we always hydrate now in summer that 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.720
 affect the tent is perfect of the 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.220
 line of 7 accounts if we make one 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.660
 small incision of the hook but let's go 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.330
 to beat the partner without any kind of 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.490
 Soil injury even after we can 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.500
 find a small if an antiseptic 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.180
 so that it helps to close the wound and 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.770
 that is not surgery the motto of the casting is 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.120
 total respect for nature in 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.360
 concerts we hope the catches of that 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.360
 way 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.469
 while we remove that hook and 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.869
 Meanwhile, look at yourself while 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.909
 We are trying to remove our 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:26.580
 carp our just the hook 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.379
 I want you to see some images that 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.159
 is going to stand up my friend diego ponte 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:36.360
 standing up because for this 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.339
 let's see these images that are 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.309
 watching you where we see your trophies

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:47.279
 this sport and good the truth that you 

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:48.869
 we are many hours I do many 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.579
 hours here in our seas and deserves the 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:52.409
 worth it and it's worth it we have almost 

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:54.329
 prepared in our letter notice 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.279

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.449
 before I wanted to show you this too 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.529
 it has altered a bit the order of what 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.029
 that I wanted to tell you because we have 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.219

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:04.199
 my hand is a cobra and you know why 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.269
 serves as they serve to prime too 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.399
 this swamp in which we are going to 

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:10.589
 do our fishing you have to take the 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.929
 charges in this sense and place it as 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:16.019
 If it were 12 o'clock, it's already two o'clock 

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.700
 I launch I call I am today regular value no 

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.470

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.540
 let's do while I 'm the 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.830
 they prepare 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.360
 or I'll try it again and sensus 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.100
 you are placed as you can the 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.110

 Tent please to take my picture 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.950
 complete to catch I can think of the 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.080
 hands to the camera even if we come to 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.990
 see catch it we're going to stay with the 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.650
 cat image and if you can not catch it 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:53.050
 it scares me there that in this chamber the 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.730
 sample is the image us image 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.220
 fixes them and us the movement 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.450
 we have managed to fish justi and now 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.770
 we return to the water 

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.599
 and to the water 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:09.270
 and now we will return we will see later 

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:09.270
 how our justice and water returns 

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.879
 well it would be fine juli is the first 

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.110
 day of karts and without that modality that is 

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.110
 Respectful with nature
