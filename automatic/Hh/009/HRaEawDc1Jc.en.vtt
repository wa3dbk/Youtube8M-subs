00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
barley cooks so this is a pearl barley

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.900 
barley cooks so this is a pearl barley
you<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.470> pearl<00:02:24.709> barley<00:02:24.920> because<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.370> takes<00:02:25.550> a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
lot less time to cook if you get regular

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.560 
lot less time to cook if you get regular
part<00:02:30.769> pot<00:02:31.190> barley<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.850> works<00:02:32.030> too<00:02:32.269> but<00:02:32.299> it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
part pot barley that works too but it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.250 
part pot barley that works too but it
just<00:02:32.690> takes<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.959> bit<00:02:32.989> longer<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.540> our<00:02:38.870> barley

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
just takes a bit longer so our barley

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.900 
just takes a bit longer so our barley
