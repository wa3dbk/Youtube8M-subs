00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
driver driver game as well which looks

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.000 
driver driver game as well which looks
pretty<00:04:51.790> cool<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.410> obviously<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.590> game<00:04:53.800> that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
pretty cool and obviously the game that

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.950 
pretty cool and obviously the game that
I'm<00:04:54.130> most<00:04:54.280> looking<00:04:54.460> forward<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.300> going<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.340 
be there which is mass effect 3 so
that's<00:04:58.240> basically<00:04:58.389> reason<00:04:58.900> why<00:04:58.990> I'm<00:04:59.110> going

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
that's basically reason why I'm going

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.900 
that's basically reason why I'm going
from<00:04:59.560> ice<00:04:59.680> factory<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.460> saints<00:05:00.760> row<00:05:00.880> the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
from ice factory and saints row the

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.750 
from ice factory and saints row the
third<00:05:01.030> third<00:05:01.810> but<00:05:02.710> yeah<00:05:02.889> there's<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.550> lot<00:05:03.700> of

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
third third but yeah there's a lot of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600

the<00:05:04.300> games<00:05:04.450> as<00:05:04.690> well<00:05:04.840> but<00:05:05.080> they're<00:05:05.740> like<00:05:06.070> what

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
the games as well but they're like what

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.580

I think the main games that are going to

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.250 
I think the main games that are going to
be<00:05:08.710> there<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.690> this<00:05:10.690> quite<00:05:10.900> there's<00:05:11.110> quite<00:05:11.230> a
