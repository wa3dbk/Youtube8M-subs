00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.900
 I do think that the parts of the body most often forgotten happens that 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.710
 we have some problem we realize that besides supporting our weight 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.910
 the feet are also indispensable to carry out our activities 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 Augustine Arias 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.269
 science and technology increasingly have more demanding applications and 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.710
 complex in our common life 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.849
 the pronghorn 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.160
 we have joined the development of biomedical research scope 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.220
 anthropometric tools to achieve the best material design solutions and 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.219
 control systems 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 the technology research center of soft 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.850
 we have set ourselves an especially complex goal 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.180
 develop the best safety shoes on the market 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.350
 in our adequate state of protection requires primarily 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 protect the foot against work risks 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.110
 also provides comfort and hygiene for a day of constant movement 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.610
 and durability against wear by extreme agents such as chemicals 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.420
 river ter I am tired of more advanced and innovative protection 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.220
 with the technology and new generation materials 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.300
 to meet protection needs 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.990
 but the most important thing is that the user 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.259
 fruit of the work done by the feet 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.259
 what favors better performance 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.010
 the elements of the neighboring nation of the developing woman the stamping of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.870
 security are the following 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.860
 reports developed under anthropometric and biomechanical studies 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.280
 The iger sole is comfortable and resistant to abrasion due to the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 combination of high performance materials and its double density is 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 excellent to cushion the impact that the step against the ground at the same time offers 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.290
 high wear resistance 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 not be in contact with the oils and satisfactorily comply with 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.290
 the tests and entity apac 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.080
 the radial design takes into account both the flexion of the foot and the best way 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 of expelling water from the sole 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.399
 the insoles are antibacterial and thermal like all the 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.529
 internal materials of footwear 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.279
 excellent for absorbing impacts and distributing plantar pressures 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.799
 also has the active system by means of independent templates 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.799
 the adjustment of the cancer can be customized 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.049
 the festive anatomical protection helmet recognizes the shape of the foot 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.189
 allowing natural movement while offering total protection 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.189
 against impacts and compression 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.789
 the chassis has the purpose of offering a better support the weight of the body 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.839
 about footwear its design and materials that dictate the cooking 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:04.459
 Strobel construction unlike traditional systems offers greater 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 lightness and flexibility 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.939
 the cut that also has the specifications for a footwear 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.869
 protection that attached to the sole by an automated injection system 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:23.609
 direct, which results in virtually one-piece shoes 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.319
 Our products have been satisfactorily evaluated the laboratories of 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.439
 physical and chemical biomechanical tests of the closure 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:52.039
 the technological innovation of the biotec line mr 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.209
 mumuni at the forefront of protective footwear 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.749
 but beyond 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.439
 takes it to pocero 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.439
 the technology that tomorrow will be indispensable 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.029
 now 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 each 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.099
