so we want to look for is we want to
look<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> tool<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> give<00:01:22.259> us

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
look for a tool that's going to give us

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.600 
look for a tool that's going to give us
a<00:01:22.530> proper<00:01:22.770> amount<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> leverage<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.520> our

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
a proper amount of leverage we want our

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420 
a proper amount of leverage we want our
leverage<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.420> 50/50<00:01:25.340> okay<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
leverage point to be about 50/50 okay so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
leverage point to be about 50/50 okay so
we<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.790> 50%<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> tool<00:01:27.630> underneath

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
we have about 50% of the tool underneath

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.660 
we have about 50% of the tool underneath
the<00:01:28.229> panel<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.799> 50%<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> tool

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the panel and about 50% of the tool

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.060 
the panel and about 50% of the tool
sticking<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.329> from<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> pen<00:01:30.689> okay<00:01:30.990> okay<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sticking out from the pen okay okay so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
sticking out from the pen okay okay so
if<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> tool<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.700> long<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
if the tool is too long it's going to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.179 
if the tool is too long it's going to
give<00:01:33.990> us<00:01:34.079> too<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.320> leverage<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.979> slip

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
give us too much leverage we can slip

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
give us too much leverage we can slip
crack<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> paint<00:01:35.939> make<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> real<00:01:36.479> sharp<00:01:36.720> high

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
crack the paint make a real sharp high

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
crack the paint make a real sharp high
point<00:01:37.170> produce<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.579> some<00:01:38.729> other<00:01:38.850> damage

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
point produce you do some other damage

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
point produce you do some other damage
okay<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> tools<00:01:40.140> too<00:01:40.290> short<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:40.619> gonna<00:01:40.740> be

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
okay the tools too short you're gonna be

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.929 
okay the tools too short you're gonna be
pushing<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.220> hard<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> again<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> can

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
pushing really hard and again you can

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.420 
pushing really hard and again you can
slip<00:01:42.180> caused<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.750> damage<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.259> tool<00:01:44.250> like

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
slip caused some damage so tool like

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.010 
slip caused some damage so tool like
this<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.079> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.500> setup<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.829> okay

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
this here this is a good setup here okay

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
this here this is a good setup here okay
it's<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.200> too<00:01:49.409> short<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.070> long<00:01:50.220> it's

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's not too short it's not so long it's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's not too short it's not so long it's
it's<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.820> pretty<00:01:51.000> much<00:01:51.180> about<00:01:51.420> even<00:01:51.780> now

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that's going to be the exact same length

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
that's going to be the exact same length
that<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> need<00:01:55.310> okay<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.460> situation<00:01:56.969> I'd

see<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.120> moving<00:03:09.210> from<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.570> top<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.080> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
see I'm moving from the top down to the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.190 
see I'm moving from the top down to the
bottom<00:03:10.320> yeah<00:03:10.860> okay<00:03:11.750> now<00:03:12.750> I'm<00:03:12.810> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.990> drag

from the top to the bottom and go back
up<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.320> top<00:03:16.470> again<00:03:16.680> no<00:03:16.800> one<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.010> that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
up to the top again no one do that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.500 
up to the top again no one do that
several<00:03:17.489> times<00:03:17.550> from<00:03:18.000> ice<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.330> get<00:03:18.420> adjusted

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
several times from ice you get adjusted

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.449 
several times from ice you get adjusted
to<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.080> once<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.739> movement<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.340> I'm

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
to it once I see the movement and I'm

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.150 
to it once I see the movement and I'm
pretty<00:03:20.730> sure<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.060> I'm<00:03:21.300> in<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> circle<00:03:22.160> push

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
pretty sure that I'm in the circle push

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.580 
pretty sure that I'm in the circle push
up<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.760> bit<00:03:23.900> now<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.140> see<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.290> soft

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
up just a bit now do you see the soft

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.750 
up just a bit now do you see the soft
eye<00:03:25.739> point<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.130> created<00:03:26.400> right<00:03:26.610> there

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
eye point that I created right there

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.300 
eye point that I created right there
here<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.120> mark<00:03:27.660> angle<00:03:28.020> yep<00:03:28.380> now<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:28.950> gives<00:03:29.130> me

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
here so mark angle yep now that gives me

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.740 
here so mark angle yep now that gives me
physical<00:03:29.700> confirmation<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.450> tip<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.690> the

physical confirmation of the tip of the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.010 
physical confirmation of the tip of the
tool<00:03:30.930> okay<00:03:31.440> okay<00:03:31.890> release<00:03:32.820> my<00:03:32.970> pressure<00:03:33.209> I'm
