00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.959
 so far, samsung is using its 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
 smartphones especially on plastic as 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.760
 Material with the A-series changes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.980
 group this strategy the galaxy a3 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 and the a5 are out with a uni body 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.219
 equipped with aluminum 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.900
 This looks fancy out there 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.789
 stability and feels good though 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 what about the internal values? 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.609
 we have the metal galaxy s on heart 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.210
 and kidney tested and with each other 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210
 compared 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.980
 except for the size of the same 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.640
 Both smartphones like an egg 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.129
 other 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.649
 only the rounded edges fall 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.300
 at the a3 a bit wider than at the 85 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.730
 the processing is both 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 devices at a very high level back 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.629
 and frames consist of one piece 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.399
 Metal hardware buttons, card slots 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.210
 and the front fit seamlessly into it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 housing 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 Both smartphones do not even measure 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.129
 seven millimeters in thickness and are 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 with 110 or 123 grams pleasantly easy like that 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.479
 is the larger galaxy a5 still 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.860
 good in the hand 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.689
 but samsung not only saves weight 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.369
 and housing also measured in terms of technology 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 Unfortunately, you are a bit frugal 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.610
 that starts with the displays the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 45 inch display of the a3 going on with 540 x 960 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 pixeln and the 5 inch display of the a5 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.369
 comes with 720 x 1280 pixels that he 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.659
 changed densities of 244 and 294 ppi 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.110
 modern upper class appliances bring it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.579
 already at values ​​above 400 p 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 so it is not surprising that at exactly 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.540
 look at both displays single 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 to recognize pixels are really 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.930
 it is noticeable that not small 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.810
 However, writing can do something 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.759
 The color representation is restless 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.439
 as usual from amoled displays vigorously 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.439
 The same applies to contrasts 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.100
 even with the processor waived say 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.260
 even on superlative 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 In both models it comes with 1 2 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.120
 gigahertz leisurely working quad 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.470
 to use this masters however 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.570
 navigate through menus and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.250
 submenus without delay and comes 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.250
 even with elaborate play to right 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 The internal memory is 16 gigabytes 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.870
 sufficiently large and can if necessary order 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.870
 up to 64gb 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.680
 the two galaxy models come along 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.900
 Android 4.4 point 4 and the Samsung 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.490
 user interface touchwiz this 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.709
 now has the possibility 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.540
 different teams choose the ones 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.540
 optically adapt surface 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 in addition, the news headline 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.230
 briefing preinstalled 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.579
 one of the few differences of the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.129
 The camera is there for both smartphones 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.129
 at the a3 it will solve with a maximum of 8 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.909
 megapixel on the camera of the ab 53 10 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.370
 megapixel 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.420
 both cameras like of good light and 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.420
 free useful results 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.859
 however, they work with the a5 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.819
 made pictures a bit pale 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.469
 for that she delivers the better ones 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.500
 indoor results with little 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.500
 light 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.160
 Samsung offers with its two galaxy 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.380
 Models of smartphones with the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.340
 done processed with partial housings 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.349
 are equipped 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.570
 the prices are around 300 euros for 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.639
 the a3 and just under 400 euros for the a5 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.810
 something elevated in trade are likely 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.580
 but also falling fast 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.410
 In total, this will deliver 100 euros 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.419
 cheaper a 3 the better price 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.240
 performance ratio , however, if you want to 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.009
 4.5 inches or 52 variants 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.759
 should depend on the personal greetings 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.759
 preference from
