hi everybody it's me again um I was able

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.730 
hi everybody it's me again um I was able
to<00:00:05.520> take<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.660> pattern<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.470> I've<00:00:07.589> been

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
to take the pattern that I've been

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.060 
to take the pattern that I've been
making<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.840> take<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.960> off<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> dress<00:00:10.740> form

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
making and take it off of the dress form

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.900 
making and take it off of the dress form
of<00:00:11.190> God<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:12.900> was<00:00:13.380> able<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.740> I've<00:00:14.700> actually

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
of God and I was able to I've actually

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.320 
of God and I was able to I've actually
started<00:00:15.500> marking<00:00:16.500> out<00:00:16.679> the<00:00:16.710> lines<00:00:17.330> definitely

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
started marking out the lines definitely

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.179 
started marking out the lines definitely
definitively<00:00:19.169> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.710> that's<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> word

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
definitively I think that's the word

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.810 
definitively I think that's the word
making<00:00:21.179> them<00:00:21.449> darker<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.259> kind<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> smoothing

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
making them darker and kind of smoothing

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.239 
making them darker and kind of smoothing
them<00:00:23.999> out<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:25.529> using<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.919> smooth

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
them out and what I'm using to smooth

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.810 
them out and what I'm using to smooth
out<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> lines<00:00:26.759> are<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.929> right<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
out the lines are these right here I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.110 
out the lines are these right here I
don't<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:29.909> if<00:00:30.060> any<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.140> who<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:32.120> let's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
don't know if any of you who are let's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000 
don't know if any of you who are let's
see<00:00:33.380> beginners<00:00:34.380> don't<00:00:34.650> know<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.830> these<00:00:34.950> are

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
see beginners don't know what these are

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.210 
see beginners don't know what these are
but<00:00:35.190> these<00:00:35.580> are<00:00:35.820> French<00:00:36.750> curves<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.500> I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
but these are French curves and I

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.060 
but these are French curves and I
actually<00:00:38.430> bought<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> set<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.330> them<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> see

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
actually bought a set of them and see

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.230 
actually bought a set of them and see
this<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:43.170> work<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.950> sewing<00:00:44.550> stuff<00:00:45.000> and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
this to work with my sewing stuff and

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540 
this to work with my sewing stuff and
you<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:45.780> need<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.380> well<00:00:47.220> you<00:00:47.370> don't

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you actually need these well you don't

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.470 
you actually need these well you don't
really<00:00:47.580> need<00:00:47.880> them<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.620> i've<00:00:49.620> used

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
really need them because i've used

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
really need them because i've used
plates<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.380> anything<00:00:53.220> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.490> think<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
plates and and anything you can think of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.150 
plates and and anything you can think of
to<00:00:54.630> make<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:54.990> curve<00:00:55.260> straight<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.950> lot

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to make my curve straight but it's a lot

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
to make my curve straight but it's a lot
easier<00:00:56.220> to<00:00:56.790> use<00:00:56.970> them<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> I've<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:57.900> been

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
easier to use them and I've just been

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.350 
easier to use them and I've just been
finding<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> curve<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.640> matches<00:01:00.330> my

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
finding the curve that matches my

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.330 
finding the curve that matches my
pattern<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> best<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.650> using<00:01:02.130> that<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
pattern the best and using that to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.999 
pattern the best and using that to
smooth<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.790> out<00:01:03.060> I<00:01:04.049> wanted<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> show<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.739> I'm

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
smooth it out I wanted to show you I'm

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.020 
smooth it out I wanted to show you I'm
still<00:01:05.280> working<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.969> fleet<00:01:06.859> but<00:01:07.999> here<00:01:08.999> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
still working on the fleet but here is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
still working on the fleet but here is
the<00:01:09.210> top<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.079> dress<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the top of the dress you can see that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
the top of the dress you can see that
very<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:14.549> top<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.969> dress<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.560> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
very well the top of the dress and I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
very well the top of the dress and I
have<00:01:16.859> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.280> extra<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.999> on<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
have a little bit extra over on this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.919 
have a little bit extra over on this
side<00:01:18.439> for<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.969> well<00:01:20.969> it's<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.569> really<00:01:21.719> for

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
side for the well it's not really for

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.550 
side for the well it's not really for
the<00:01:21.990> seam<00:01:22.319> so<00:01:22.590> much<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.090> um<00:01:24.560> because

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the seam so much but it's um because

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
the seam so much but it's um because
I'll<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.399> say<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.850> used<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.509> smaller

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'll see how to say I used a smaller

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
I'll see how to say I used a smaller
piece<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.319> I<00:01:28.380> had<00:01:28.499> practiced<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.100> earlier

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
piece that I had practiced on earlier

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
piece that I had practiced on earlier
and<00:01:29.819> so<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.240> how<00:01:30.389> I<00:01:30.479> got<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> extra<00:01:31.259> piece

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and so that's how I got this extra piece

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
and so that's how I got this extra piece
um<00:01:32.539> here<00:01:33.539> right<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.319> is<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.639> dart<00:01:35.639> and<00:01:35.939> I'm

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
um here right here is the dart and I'm

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
um here right here is the dart and I'm
still<00:01:36.479> working<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:36.990> making<00:01:37.139> that<00:01:37.350> darker<00:01:37.859> but

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
still working on making that darker but

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.379 
still working on making that darker but
you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.249> see<00:01:38.429> on<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:38.789> side<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> I've

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:39.389 
you can see on one side that I've

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.069 
you can see on one side that I've
already<00:01:39.569> started<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.319> it<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:41.509> I<00:01:42.509> wanted<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
already started on it and I wanted to

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
already started on it and I wanted to
tell<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.249> you're<00:01:44.399> making<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.819> dart

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
tell you that when you're making a dart

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.660 
tell you that when you're making a dart
like<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.569> um<00:01:46.109> I<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.859> know<00:01:47.039> I'm<00:01:47.429> sure

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
like this um I don't know I'm sure

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
like this um I don't know I'm sure
there's<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:48.179> some<00:01:48.539> type<00:01:48.719> of<00:01:48.749> video<00:01:49.200> on

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
there's probably some type of video on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
there's probably some type of video on
this<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:50.009> you're<00:01:50.130> making<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.520> dart<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.909> this

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this when you're making a dart like this

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.919 
this when you're making a dart like this
and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.569> put<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.069> your<00:01:53.069> your<00:01:53.939> dress<00:01:54.420> form

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
and you put it on your your dress form

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.919 
and you put it on your your dress form
and<00:01:55.289> then<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.709> pull<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> dart<00:01:56.729> together<00:01:57.149> that

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
and then you pull the dart together that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.620 
and then you pull the dart together that
you<00:01:58.170> take<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> needles<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.969> make<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you take the needles and you make it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.599 
you take the needles and you make it
tight<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.529> take<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> needles<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
tight so you take the needles and you

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.289 
tight so you take the needles and you
turn<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:02.969> sideways<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:05.039> pin<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.999> here

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
turn them sideways and you pin from here

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.869 
turn them sideways and you pin from here
to<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.340> then<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.519> mark<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
to here and then then you mark that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.639 
to here and then then you mark that
before<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.599> take<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> needles<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.409> because

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
before you take the needles out because

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.630 
before you take the needles out because
if<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:10.830> don't<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.159> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.489> big

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
if you don't you're going to be in big

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
if you don't you're going to be in big
trouble<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
trouble and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.720 
trouble and
that's<00:02:13.770> probably<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.130> stupid<00:02:14.310> thing<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> say

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that's probably a stupid thing to say

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's probably a stupid thing to say
because<00:02:15.770> everybody<00:02:16.770> knew<00:02:16.920> would<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.250> would

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
because everybody knew would think would

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.630 
because everybody knew would think would
get<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:17.910> anyways<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.890> did<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.340> calm

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
get that but anyways so I did the calm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.780 
get that but anyways so I did the calm
down<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.069> see<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> very

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
down here and you can see it very

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.479 
down here and you can see it very
carefully<00:02:24.650> us<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.470> i<00:02:28.560> did<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.890> curve<00:02:29.220> down

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
carefully us it is i did this curve down

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.259 
carefully us it is i did this curve down
here<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.090> where<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
here and right about here is where the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.870 
here and right about here is where the
hip<00:02:33.480> starts<00:02:33.750> coming<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.410> now<00:02:35.040> i'm<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.790> be

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
hip starts coming in now i'm going to be

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.839 
hip starts coming in now i'm going to be
doing<00:02:36.060> most<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:37.019> this<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.430> i<00:02:38.580> said<00:02:38.760> before

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
doing most of this like i said before

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.229 
doing most of this like i said before
straight<00:02:39.569> but<00:02:40.530> i<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> small<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.940> very

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
straight but i have a small a very

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.960 
straight but i have a small a very
slight<00:02:43.050> curve<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.310> reason<00:02:44.640> i<00:02:44.700> want<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
slight curve and the reason i want the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.180 
slight curve and the reason i want the
slight<00:02:45.239> curve<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.870> because<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.709> if<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
slight curve is because if you if you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.030 
slight curve is because if you if you
take<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.700> out<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> pull<00:02:49.830> out<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
take it out like this and you pull out a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.910 
take it out like this and you pull out a
wider<00:02:50.850> curve<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.569> front<00:02:51.870> piece<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.440> is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
wider curve on this front piece it is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.309 
wider curve on this front piece it is
not<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.459> hang<00:02:53.730> right<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.720> going<00:02:55.110> to

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
not going to hang right it's going to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.910 
not going to hang right it's going to
when<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> fabric<00:02:56.790> hangs<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.569> going<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.530> hang

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
when the fabric hangs it's going to hang

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.490
