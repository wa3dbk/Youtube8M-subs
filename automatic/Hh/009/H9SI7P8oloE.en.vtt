00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 yo guys hello it's time 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.810
 do away with the myth that the console 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.910
 much more profitable than many are now 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.480
 they can crow to start the same 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 battlefield 4 sets in 1080 p + 60 fps 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.330
 how is it done on the same ps4 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.640
 Well, you need while thousands so for 50 for 80 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 and people still believe in the outdated 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 the stereotype is now a little price 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.840
 iron for showed decline and I know 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 I was very surprised when I went to Yandex 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.309
 and looked why why in our time 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 now as you know ps4 costs about 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 thirty thousand for the money we get 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.260
 excellent console with a bunch of exclusives 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.680
 but let's not forget about powerful yet 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 until 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 so for 30,000 you can now easily 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 buy bye that will run all 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 at maximum speeds also at 60fps i.e. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 concerns the same gta 5 battlefield 4 and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.610
 Of course to with goal in general everywhere you set 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 high and get 60 fps 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 I will remind on ps4 in the same gta 5 only 30 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 fps it is ours with you while it is 60 fps 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.189
 plus 1080p 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.380
 what kind of miracle is for 30,000 from me 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.110
 turned out if you buy now 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.540
 a new PC then take all of the parts 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 there is a separate motive vidyuhi and so on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 because coming and buying something 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 the finished one is definitely not worth much 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.460
 you will overpay 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.890
 I want to tell you what you need to buy 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 components totaling 30 thousand 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.170
 to run everything at max speed 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.619
 let's start with the type now the price of intel i5 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.850
 decreased so boldly take it for 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.790
 9000 we get full 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.920
 quad-core chip with a frequency of 3100 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.869
 and you know this is the best offer that you 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.759
 can find it for the money 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.829
 the ideal option goes further with us 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.500
 motherboard on it we are a little bit 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.490
 save and take decisions from asus 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.619
 a3000 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.899
 it is basically enough for ours with 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.390
 you iron now go to the memory 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.509
 take 8 gigabytes of ram from 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.490
 Kingston priced at 4,000 and this option 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.130
 you just have enough for the next few 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.230
 years well and now the most important thing in our with 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.890
 Bye you, this vidyuha 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.180
 I suggest you take gtx 960 this is new 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.060
 g-tx series model 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.460
 video memory 2 GB and I know 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 I looked at a bunch of tests and not so lead 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.450
 you can run absolutely everything on 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.970
 Max Wux goal but in general there will be fps 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.460
 two hundred and three hundred so this is perfect 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 option in terms of price and quality 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.900
 the price of such vidyuhi only eleven 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.730
 thousand and for this money damn it is great 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
 the decision and principle are all basic 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.680
 components we have already looked left 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.200
 matter of small cooling power supply 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 hard drive and case cooling for 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.610
 we take chips from the company a cap 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.880
 It costs only 700 we have a block 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.120
 power supply 600 watts for 2500 then 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.160
 1000 gigabyte hard drive also 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.350
 2500 and the principle remains only the case itself 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.600
 where will you stuff all the components 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.880
 we take the cheapest for 900 and in 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.500
 In principle, everything is ready for now and all these 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.630
 we only have components 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.610
 by 30 with a few thousand while on 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.670
 this gland will all run on 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.490
 maximum speed but of course what to buy ps4 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.830
 this is up to you. ps4 is 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.060
 their exclusives have also not yet there 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.370
 so decide 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 but hopefully a stereotype to a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.350
 costs too much will be done away in 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.930
 principle on this all I showed you what 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.640
 you need to buy while for 30,000 to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.390
 run the same gta 5 on 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.040
 maximum speed 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.750
 and I will be very pleased if you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.760
