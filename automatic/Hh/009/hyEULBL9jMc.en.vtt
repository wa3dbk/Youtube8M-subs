00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.410

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
 I had in the shop the rosÃ©s him 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 so I 'll put the link in the bar 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
 do not hesitate to inquire 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 are really pretty things at prices 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 very advantageous 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 so here may be last blow of heart 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
 it's in this little shop that I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.460
 have them so I leave you with me 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 stay tuned and tell me what 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.880
 what do you think 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 kisses so first hairstyle we go 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 start with something very 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 simple we will take our red bend 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 the past is really left the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 hair so let go so you have 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 smooth hair or curly rendering 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 will be in the same spirit second 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.659
 hairstyle this time we are going to keep 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.390
 the headband with the hair back 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.150
 and we will turn into a bun 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.229
 up and then fix with a few 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.450
 round pliers 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.000
 so it's really a hairstyle I 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 would say very simple and fast for all 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.829
 the days so we will shoot a little bit 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 on the sides according to the facts 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.750
 we want to give 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.689
 here are results the second so 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.280
 now place the 3rd hairstyle on 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.909
 will create a little bit actually the back 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.909
 of the hair 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.130
 so here we do the same thing on the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.080
 top of the head and on the sides as 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.700
 you will see that so it's just for 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.000
 that it's nicer actually for the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 after 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.570
 so items on the left side and in 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.330
 cap to remove small bumps 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.910
 and that's where we're going to actually make a 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.350
 sort of low tail in and yann it's 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.380
 so to keep the volume that we have at 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.890
 prior made actually on our 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.200
 hair 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.209
 So there we go we will take control 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.940
 to do in with an effect manage a small 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.920
 little clutter so there is no method 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.959
 precise what is certain is that if you 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.550
 have long hair or more or less 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.560
 short it's quite possible to 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.300
 do that kind of bun down so we 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.430
 fixed all with small 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.739
 round tweezers and you're done so 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.630
 you have a pretty hairstyle you can 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.260
 do it in two to three minutes and that's it 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.260
 the result 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.430
 so up to the 4th hairstyle this time 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.090
 so a little in the same spirit as the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.040
 former 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 we're just going to do that on the side 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.239
 so that I personally adore 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.820
 hairstyles on the side whether with 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.010
 loose hair chignon here's plenty of 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.900
 full of solutions and we will fix so 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 in the same way with small clamps 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.580
 round so on the top underneath we 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.709
 always keep well in hand in fact the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.890
 bun as long as we are not sure of 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.910
 have it secured with the round pliers 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.950
 for the helmets a few wicks 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.340
 stand out and here are results of the 4th 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.340
 hairstyle 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.390
 finally we place in the 5th hairstyle on 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.390
 will actually delimit our hairstyle 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.070
 with the help of the tail comb and we're going 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.600
 place the raid ben so above 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.640
 many of you make me 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.250
 say that when you use this 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.900
 method is beautiful so does not fit in 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.160
 do you go see me I'm using 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.520
 small flat pliers 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.280
 just to help him stay I 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.040
 would say set all day so you 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.440
 take the plett pliers and fix it 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.790
 that's it with I would say down all 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.169
 just do it on both sides 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.209
 do not hesitate to put several to 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.440
 that it's okay so after that I 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.000
 will take the hair that is on the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 in front of and measured the one doorman so 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.270
 I take two locks people ride in 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.280
 made 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 and every time I take over so 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.910
 only on a wick and wind 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.550
 a wick and so we always arrive 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.000
 with the one on the front I 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.220
 would say so we continue in the same way 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.230
 so beforehand we can delimit a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 to hair that is to say those who 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.510
 will be squirming on the left side 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.260
 and the one that sells on the right side 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.260
 so you continue 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.110
 and here it is, I put it on the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:09.300
 right side and we continue in fact our 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.530
 twists we continue to the end so 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.360
 my hair is long but you 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.520
 can get a good result even if 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 your hair is half long or see 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.009
 that it happens to you at the shoulders and there in 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.349
 a movement of yesterday is rounded we are going 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.300
 fix everything is there we start again with 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.490
 red bull to be certain actually that 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.979
 the rebels do not stop everything 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.500
 so just the device we start 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.270
 the twist with which all the hair 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.759
 that they stay the goal it's really 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.960
 to have a hairstyle that's for the 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.580
 in fact we do not have hair that 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.639
 embarrass us something that is really 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.039
 managed in a slightly bohemian spirit 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:53.250
 relaxed but still very good 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:56.330
 we continue our recipe as 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.330
 for the left side 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.500
 and then we go the task and and make it 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:11.199
 to actually bond with each other with the help of 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.300
 small clamps to fix everything in 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.460
 so does holiday it's really having 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.810
 two mirrors 1 in front of a behind for 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.979

 turn the shape you want so 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:27.580
 there we can decide to give a small 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.759
 little more light and fix with 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.139
 like pliers always a little bit more 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.789
 of volume and here are the results the 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.159
