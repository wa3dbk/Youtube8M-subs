00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
hair is up to bobby pin whatever I feel
like<00:01:43.049> isn't<00:01:43.560> sturdy<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.610> again<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.090> we're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
like isn't sturdy so again all we're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
like isn't sturdy so again all we're
going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:46.020> random<00:01:46.560> strand

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.130
