this is Paul Hamilton what we're going
to<00:00:01.979> do<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.520> we're<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> go<00:00:03.629> in<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:03.929> look

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
to do is we're going to go in and look

to do is we're going to go in and look
at<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.230> flight<00:00:04.440> simulator<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> zodiac

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
at the flight simulator for the zodiac

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.419 
at the flight simulator for the zodiac
here<00:00:06.629> it's<00:00:07.290> always<00:00:07.560> better<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.890> fly<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.189> real

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
here it's always better to fly the real

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.330 
here it's always better to fly the real
airplane<00:00:08.940> but<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.929> flight<00:00:10.290> simulator<00:00:10.559> can<00:00:11.099> add

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
airplane but a flight simulator can add

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.580 
airplane but a flight simulator can add
a<00:00:11.400> number<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.090> benefits<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.750> let's<00:00:13.200> go<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.469> at

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
a number of benefits so let's go look at

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.090 
a number of benefits so let's go look at
the<00:00:13.710> flight<00:00:13.920> simulator<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> zodiac<00:00:16.100> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the flight simulator for the zodiac and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:27.380 
the flight simulator for the zodiac and
we'll<00:00:17.460> head<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> office<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:26.390> so

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
we'll head on into the office here so

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
we'll head on into the office here so
here<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> Play<00:00:28.410> simulator<00:00:28.920> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here we are at the Play simulator so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519 
here we are at the Play simulator so
let's<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:30.869> first<00:00:31.260> off

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
got our carbine all here on levers that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
got our carbine all here on levers that
are<00:00:51.059> very<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.390> similar<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> aircraft

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
we're going to check our flight controls

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
we're going to check our flight controls
first<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> check<00:01:00.660> our

working properly and we can even look at

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.540 
working properly and we can even look at
our<00:01:29.030> different<00:01:29.330> views<00:01:29.720> here<00:01:33.340> look<00:01:34.340> at<00:01:34.460> our
