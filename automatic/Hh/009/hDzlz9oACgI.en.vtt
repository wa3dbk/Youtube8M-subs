textures<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> axles<00:00:14.160> that's<00:00:15.150> kind<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
textures on the axles that's kind of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.380 
textures on the axles that's kind of
hard<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.719> sometimes<00:00:16.820> kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> confusing

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
hard to do sometimes kind of confusing

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.269 
hard to do sometimes kind of confusing
tires<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.350> stuck<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> ground<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.039> little<00:00:20.130> bit

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
tires are stuck in a ground a little bit

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.609 
tires are stuck in a ground a little bit
i<00:00:20.400> think<00:00:20.520> that's<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:21.380> making<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> tires

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
i think that's from making the tires

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
i think that's from making the tires
bigger<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.550> there's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> way<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.090> do

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
bigger I think there's a way you can do

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.210 
bigger I think there's a way you can do
that<00:00:25.730> go<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.180> script<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.949> something

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that go into the script and do something

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.299 
that go into the script and do something
with<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.109> radius<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> tire<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.189> can

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
with the radius of the tire and you can

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
with the radius of the tire and you can
turn<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.850> bit<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.270> put<00:00:33.960> you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
turn up a little bit and it will put you

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.540 
turn up a little bit and it will put you
up<00:00:34.140> back<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.920> normal<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.110> would<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
up back up normal so I would do that I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.959 
up back up normal so I would do that I
like<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> brush<00:00:39.270> guard<00:00:39.540> looks<00:00:39.960> awesome<00:00:40.550> so
