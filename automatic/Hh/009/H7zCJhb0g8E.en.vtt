00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello how am I triforce the base a 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.419
 very very quick very short tutorial for 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.580
 the nexus 4 have access lte in the 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.170
 Android version 4.3 and the living in the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.540
 latest manual version of google 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.509
 but they decided to disable the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.939
 lte since officially the nexus 4 is not 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.519
 an equipment lte but fortunately with 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.949
 that kind of tricks we can enable that 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.279
 radio those bands of this frequency and 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.900
 enjoy here in Mexico from the ett excel or 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.999
 are in another country that is operator be 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.630
 compatible so let's see what can 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.390
 do 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.340
 they need the nexus 4 a usb cable the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.920
 computer with windows to pass the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.960
 files rather only to a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.230
 file in this case is called lt 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.980
 they need a dry recital to focus there 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.200
 hybrid steak 3384 that is a 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.940
 combination that you know is a combination 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:59.840
 to go to radio point 33 of the version 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.590
 24.21 and 84 and the radio version 4 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.500
 point 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.229
 sorry 4.3 in your case as I say if you 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.140
 combine the two and we can have access 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.420
 to elite then we just copy it 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.150
 to the internal memory of the nexus 4 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.700
 we open here the folder the root folder 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.649
 and here I have downloaded the file in 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.610
 a download folder I put here 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.250
 copy 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.030
 and if I take Annexes 4 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 but 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.600
 and he is copying it ready that weighs 1 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.570
 point 12 mb really nothing closed everything 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.460
 this we turn off our nexus device 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.740
 4 we connect from that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.470
 the usb cable so it does not stay 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.420
 charging the good battery we pay it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.590
 so quickly that the song to see there 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.450
 there is a logo of the icon 10 and 13 to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.300
 do that I'm going to have access to lte 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.180
 always when in a coverage room 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.400
 we pay it to the fast team that runs out 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.330
 the time here in the camera here the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.330
 person I have a battery 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.230
 quickly 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.280
 I'm going to leave this here they access the mode 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.160
 obviously they should have 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.200
 root access in your nexus 4 must also 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.030
 have a custom recovery so they can 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.030
 do this otherwise it is impossible 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.940
 is button to then go back and down to it 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.510
 time with button on I access this 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.080
 part I choose recovery mons we enter 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.080
 recovery 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.600
 we choose the file your fonseca 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 novak 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.940
 we must enter again since I get 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.310
 to pick up and a lot 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.510
 I choose the file that we just copied 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.780
 it's here it's called lt hy 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 there's the file I'm going to choose what 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.950
 I'm going to bloom I'll get it installed 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.069
 and that simple and enabled the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.880
 frequency of lte in its 4 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.200
 it is not flowing 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.200
 to start the team 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.410
 loving 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.680
 we are just going to enter a menu 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.990
 and I did it previously but I'm going to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.500
 do for you to do it too 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.810
 already only once you enter it 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.450
 on sufficient basis for them to have 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.810
 access to the lte network are here the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:20.260
 keyboard with this disk cat asterisk 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.880
 cat 4636 you killed disco cat this disc 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.120
 open that menu with the information of 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.120
 device 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.750
 who gets stung 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.169
 cdm etc to let it come out 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.149
 and there as I tell them if they have coverage 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.399
 of lte will automatically be the 

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:42.109
 switch this procedure is only 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:44.809
 compatible with nexus 4 do not try it on 

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:45.379
 other teams and then from my part that's 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.959
 all 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:51.229
 I am triforce studio was for android 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:53.829
 mx dot net and see you until the 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.829
