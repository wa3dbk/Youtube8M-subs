00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 the agent Rick Perry Piñata and also 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.329
 I hope I have the helicopter 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.969
 discoverer in a toy story cake in 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.560
 order there are many things and all in 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.599
 I try to share them all 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 even if it's two digits when it 's a 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:30.840
 determined cake or the piñata that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 I'm trying to cover how it's done 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.770
 all the piñata in a short time doing it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.239
 I miniature of those good you 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.979
 see how the structure works 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:43.140
 which I consider to be the most 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.209
 important of a piñata the other is already 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.849
 question of looking at the image that they are 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.539
 copying and it's also good to cover with 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:53.579
 good paste is simpler and good 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.400
 I have many things I only ask 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.450
 subscribe 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.030
 and also have a positive mind to the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.880
 time to watch the video consider then 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.480
 all girls because it's time invested 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.850
 is 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.150
 things that one stops doing to do the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.470
 video then consider all that and in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.900
 Any case think that I do everything from 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.440
 good faith and simply with the only desire 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.650
 to share what little I've learned 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.590
 in these years of working with cakes and 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.000
 piñatas ok a big kiss for all 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.640
 always with God and well let's 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 show them the cake that I hope it's 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.160
 of all of you and I am going to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.540
 teach this cake is for only 15 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 people that is not very big 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.000
 I wanted to make it white 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.689
 erasing it with the white fondant for 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.379
 have a little more life put 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:03.129
 that the colors that dora is wearing are a 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.689
 little is to say orange pink yellow 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.530
 Brown 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.180
 and in general good is how you do not have 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.519
 many the ones for Milan co is like that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.049
 it gives reflections of light beams of light that is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.349
 what I wanted or what I look for in the 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.269
 good cakes then it's simply 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.190
 it's a tall cake about 6 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.460
 centimeters or 7 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.410
 and there are flowers around and well then 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.930
 to fill all the empty spaces 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.620
 I did it with smaller flowers 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.550
 yellow 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.270
 I did as a kind of 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.120
 that it would be some lollipops but 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.620
 fondant are edible and good that 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.060
 simply to give more height to the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:51.130
 cake and good now you are already the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.130
 I taught how we did it the previous time 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 The only thing that was attached was the 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.099
 Backpack that good is supported by the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.200
 ground 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.220
 I think with you I made a cake of 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.530
 dora 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.170
 sitting in a tower that leads to go as 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.400
 all presented with a sailor dress 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.750
 that it was not the traditional dora costume 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.970
 but good in the same way is that 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.970
 I worked state now that they are standing 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.570
 basically on the face is the same and the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.270
 body also the only thing that varied in the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.900
 position of the body and the suit but 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.120
 well you already have an idea and that 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.100
 more good that 's all it's a cake 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.000

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.640
 chocolate cake 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.090

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.090
