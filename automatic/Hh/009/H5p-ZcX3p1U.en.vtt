00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a ramp for a wheelchair if you look at

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
a ramp for a wheelchair if you look at
the<00:00:55.170> steps<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.399> they're<00:00:56.579> real<00:00:56.850> steep

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the steps you know they're real steep

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
the steps you know they're real steep
real<00:00:57.660> noticeable<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> visually<00:00:59.160> see

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
real noticeable you can visually see

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
real noticeable you can visually see
them<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
them and you can think of that like the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
them and you can think of that like the
layers<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.430> paint<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.420> edges

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
layers of paint you know the hard edges

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.830 
layers of paint you know the hard edges
and<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.920> look<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> ramp<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.689> it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and if you look at a ramp you know it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990 
and if you look at a ramp you know it's
a<00:01:06.990> smooth<00:01:07.380> transition<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.460> from<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> bottom

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a smooth transition down from the bottom

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
a smooth transition down from the bottom
level<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.590> top<00:01:10.799> level<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.340> real

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
level up to the top level it's real

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
level up to the top level it's real
smooth<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.720> wheelchair<00:01:13.170> can

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
smooth you know so that a wheelchair can

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.920 
smooth you know so that a wheelchair can
easily<00:01:13.710> roll<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> be

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
easily roll up and down it now to be

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
easily roll up and down it now to be
able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> ramp<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> smooth

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
able to have that ramp have that smooth

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
able to have that ramp have that smooth
transition<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> take

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
transition you know that's going to take

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.310 
transition you know that's going to take
a<00:01:19.500> longer<00:01:19.860> area<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:21.030> steps<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a longer area than steps would so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
a longer area than steps would so
feather<00:01:22.740> edging<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.520> process<00:01:24.030> we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
feather edging is the same process we

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
feather edging is the same process we
need<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.600> those<00:01:24.840> layers<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.290> paint<00:01:25.619> like

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
need to take those layers of paint like

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.640 
need to take those layers of paint like
steps<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.610> layer<00:01:27.330> lay<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.560> at

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
steps and layer lay them out you know at

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
steps and layer lay them out you know at
least<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.950> quarter<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.430> inch<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.030> each

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
least a quarter of an inch for each

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.929 
least a quarter of an inch for each
layer<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> small<00:01:31.799> tip<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.579> might

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
layer so a small tip you know might

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.940 
layer so a small tip you know might
start<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.299> small<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> time<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
start out small but by the time that you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
start out small but by the time that you
get<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.820> layer<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.329> properly<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
get this layer out properly get a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
get this layer out properly get a
feather<00:01:37.409> edge<00:01:37.590> properly<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.579> it's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700

interface pad for final sanding but
remember<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.299> follows<00:02:57.750> the

remember that because it follows the

remember that because it follows the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
want it to follow you know the the pain

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.750 
want it to follow you know the the pain
edge<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.500> hard<00:03:04.709> edge<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.130> want<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.670> the

edge the hard edge we want it to the
level<00:03:06.000> across<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.709> use<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.130> pad

level across that so if you use that pad
on<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.910> gonna<00:03:09.030> follow<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> contour

on that it's gonna follow that contour
it's<00:03:10.380> going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.709> very<00:03:10.950> difficult<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.459> get

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it's going to be very difficult to get

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's going to be very difficult to get

that feather edge smooth and get those

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.350 
that feather edge smooth and get those
coatings<00:03:14.370> out<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.819> there's<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> quarter

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
coatings out you know there's a quarter

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.420 
coatings out you know there's a quarter
of<00:03:15.480> an<00:03:15.569> inch<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.170> want<00:03:16.440> them<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.100> that's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
of an inch like we want them so that's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.650 
of an inch like we want them so that's
why<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.609> don't<00:03:17.790> want<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.060> use<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.269> interface

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
why you don't want to use that interface

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690 
why you don't want to use that interface
pad<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.230> use<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> DA<00:03:19.650> pad<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.130> has<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.310> harder

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
pad you use the DA pad that has a harder

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.150 
pad you use the DA pad that has a harder
surface<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.630> it'll<00:03:21.840> cut<00:03:22.019> across<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.709> level

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
surface and it'll cut across and level

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.580 
surface and it'll cut across and level
those<00:03:23.310> layers<00:03:23.579> much<00:03:23.940> better<00:03:24.269> now<00:03:25.079> feather

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
those layers much better now feather

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.770 
those layers much better now feather
edging<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.370> done<00:03:26.579> using<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.090> block<00:03:27.420> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
edging can be done using a block you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.720 
edging can be done using a block you
know<00:03:27.959> hand<00:03:28.170> blocking<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.829> with<00:03:29.010> some<00:03:29.160> 220

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
know hand blocking it out with some 220

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.130 
know hand blocking it out with some 220
however<00:03:30.269> that's<00:03:30.390> gonna<00:03:30.630> take<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> lot<00:03:31.109> more

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
however that's gonna take a lot more

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.069 
however that's gonna take a lot more
effort<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.980> time<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:33.989> you

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
effort and time to do that so if you

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.660 
effort and time to do that so if you
don't<00:03:34.290> feather<00:03:34.560> edge<00:03:34.769> correctly<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
don't feather edge correctly what this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.849 
don't feather edge correctly what this
may<00:03:35.820> cause<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.450> rings<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.200> may<00:03:37.380> not<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.709> been

may cause is rings it may not have been
noticeable<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.910> when<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.209> until<00:03:39.480> you

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
noticeable you know when it until you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.440 
coated and you pull it outside and you
see<00:03:43.709> rings<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.850> know<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.030> look<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.329> the

see rings you know you look down the
side<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.140> ring<00:03:46.500> or<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.890> may<00:03:47.010> even<00:03:47.160> have

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
multiple rings where you can actually

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.390 
multiple rings where you can actually
see<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.500> different<00:03:49.799> levels<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
see the different levels of the

see the different levels of the
different<00:03:50.579> coatings<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> way<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.109> prevent

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
different coatings so the way to prevent

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.410 
different coatings so the way to prevent
that<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.859> like<00:03:53.190> we've<00:03:53.370> mentioned<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:54.299> know

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
that is like we've mentioned you know

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.300 
that is like we've mentioned you know
sand<00:03:54.840> each<00:03:55.049> layer<00:03:55.350> at<00:03:55.500> least<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.829> quarter<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.220> an

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
inch and if you feather edged I think

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.750 
inch and if you feather edged I think
it's<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.410> good<00:03:58.560> idea<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.859> go<00:03:59.040> ahead<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.430> prime

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
it's a good idea to go ahead and prime
