sound on it just so you can see how the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:48.400 
sound on it just so you can see how the
performance<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:45.230> let's<00:02:46.230> mute<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
performance is let's mute it again and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
performance is let's mute it again and
I'm<00:02:49.410> gonna<00:02:49.530> try<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:49.890> bring<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.340> full<00:02:50.610> screen

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
I'm gonna try and bring it full screen

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.580 
I'm gonna try and bring it full screen
now<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.300> can<00:02:51.510> see<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> performance<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> is

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
now you can see the performance on it is

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.140 
now you can see the performance on it is
pretty<00:02:52.709> good<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.190> movement<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.820> pretty

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
pretty good the movement on is pretty

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.840 
pretty good the movement on is pretty
smooth<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:56.100> very<00:02:56.489> watchable<00:03:00.080> let<00:03:01.080> me

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
smooth and it's very watchable let me

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.410 
smooth and it's very watchable let me
make<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.030> fullscreen<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:07.910> as<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.180> see

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
make it fullscreen and as you can see

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.190 
make it fullscreen and as you can see
it's<00:03:09.600> very<00:03:09.690> fluid<00:03:10.550> very<00:03:11.550> good<00:03:11.820> performance

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
it's very fluid very good performance

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.729 
it's very fluid very good performance
now<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.560> running<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.010> 480p<00:03:15.410> my<00:03:16.410> videos

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
now this is running in 480p my videos

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.280 
now this is running in 480p my videos
are<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:16.980> 720<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.110> not

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
are in 720 and right now it's not

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.610 
are in 720 and right now it's not
letting<00:03:19.560> me<00:03:19.709> upgrade<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> 720p

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
letting me upgrade it to the 720p

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.930

supposedly within a couple of weeks the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.540 
supposedly within a couple of weeks the
720p<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.900> be<00:03:25.050> very<00:03:25.500> fluid<00:03:25.830> that's<00:03:26.400> what

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
720p will be very fluid that's what

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.610 
720p will be very fluid that's what
they're<00:03:26.670> working<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:28.020> that's<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
now we're gonna try congregate the site

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.130 
now we're gonna try congregate the site
that<00:03:39.690> has<00:03:39.900> flash<00:03:40.709> games<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.780> let's<00:03:42.959> back

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
all right I think it's loaded up we're

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.190 
all right I think it's loaded up we're
just<00:04:17.389> gonna<00:04:17.600> click<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.109> start<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:19.600> here<00:04:20.600> we<00:04:20.720> go

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
just gonna click to start and here we go

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.600 
just gonna click to start and here we go
game<00:04:21.919> loaded<00:04:22.460> click<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.970> start<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.220> have<00:04:28.400> no

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
idea how to play this game but we're

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:49.360 
idea how to play this game but we're
gonna<00:04:30.080> wing<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.470> here

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.970 

okay<00:04:50.180> here<00:04:50.360> we<00:04:50.389> go<00:04:50.930> click<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.650> background

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
okay here we go click on the background

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.879 
okay here we go click on the background
to<00:04:52.699> chain<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.270> attack<00:04:53.830> collect<00:04:54.830> sushi<00:04:56.889> okay

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
to chain and attack collect sushi okay

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.469 
to chain and attack collect sushi okay
so<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:58.100> think<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.310> just<00:04:58.460> have<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.699> swipe<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.300> it

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
so I think you just have to swipe on it

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:11.659 
so I think you just have to swipe on it
we'll<00:04:59.900> see<00:05:00.139> how<00:05:00.229> this<00:05:00.410> goes

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:19.469 

okay<00:05:16.680> that's<00:05:17.680> some<00:05:17.889> sushi<00:05:18.190> there<00:05:18.699> so

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
okay that's some sushi there so

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.790 
okay that's some sushi there so
basically<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.840> just<00:05:19.990> have<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.259> click<00:05:20.470> on<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
basically I just have to click on the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.890 
basically I just have to click on the
enemies<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.759> little<00:05:22.030> hamster<00:05:22.270> attacks

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.870 
enemies and the little hamster attacks
the<00:05:23.139> robot<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:25.680> suppose<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.919> can't<00:05:27.250> jump<00:05:27.639> off<00:05:27.850> of

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
the robot I suppose I can't jump off of

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.990 
the robot I suppose I can't jump off of
this<00:05:28.090> platform<00:05:29.460> looks<00:05:30.460> like<00:05:30.669> there's<00:05:30.850> some

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
this platform looks like there's some

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:42.640 
this platform looks like there's some
lasers<00:05:31.479> in<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.810> way<00:05:31.990> there

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.840 

okay<00:05:43.650> I<00:05:43.680> can<00:05:43.980> jump<00:05:44.310> down<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.670> lower

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
okay I can jump down to the lower

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.640 
okay I can jump down to the lower
platform<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.810> as<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.050> see<00:05:46.110> this<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.470> all

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
platform but as you can see this is all

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.880 
platform but as you can see this is all
in<00:05:46.830> flash<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:48.450> is<00:05:48.660> how<00:05:48.810> flash<00:05:49.170> performs

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
in flash and this is how flash performs

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.350 
in flash and this is how flash performs
on<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.280> Motorola<00:05:51.120> Xoom<00:05:51.150> tablet<00:05:51.600> here<00:05:52.110> and
