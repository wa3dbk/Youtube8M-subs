destiny<00:00:05.339> with<00:00:05.970> an<00:00:06.799> idea<00:00:07.799> um<00:00:08.330> we<00:00:09.330> were<00:00:09.420> talking

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
destiny with an idea um we were talking

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.879 
destiny with an idea um we were talking
today<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:10.710> stream<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.670> actually

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
today on my on my stream and I actually

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.870 
today on my on my stream and I actually
came<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:14.040> with<00:00:14.160> something<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.549> think<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
came up with something I think is a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
came up with something I think is a
pretty<00:00:15.150> good<00:00:15.420> idea<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.900> nice<00:00:16.440> change<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.920> sure

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pretty good idea a nice change to sure

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.220 
pretty good idea a nice change to sure
that<00:00:17.460> would<00:00:17.580> not<00:00:17.699> only<00:00:17.730> make<00:00:18.029> him<00:00:18.420> like

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
that would not only make him like

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.210 
that would not only make him like
relevant<00:00:20.010> again<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.119> would<00:00:21.240> also<00:00:22.160> kind<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
relevant again but it would also kind of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.099 
relevant again but it would also kind of
revitalize<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> game<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.510> bit<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:25.019> it

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
revitalize the game a little bit when it

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.279 
revitalize the game a little bit when it
comes<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.619> item<00:00:26.279> acquisition<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:28.170> idea

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
comes to item acquisition so the idea

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
comes to item acquisition so the idea
that<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.650> had<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.460> every<00:00:29.760> week<00:00:30.029> if<00:00:30.359> sure

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that I had was that every week if sure

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
that I had was that every week if sure
instead<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.619> bringing<00:00:31.769> his<00:00:32.130> usual<00:00:32.640> stock

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
instead of just bringing his usual stock

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.680 
instead of just bringing his usual stock
of<00:00:33.300> exotics<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> random<00:00:34.739> stuff<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
lemon trees which are important in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
idea when I had it just sounded good

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
idea when I had it just sounded good
because<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.060> sort<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> wanted<00:01:15.900> people<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
because I just sort of wanted people to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
because I just sort of wanted people to
not<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.070> angry<00:01:17.250> adjure<00:01:17.700> anymore<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> mean<00:01:18.390> it's

a<00:01:18.630> nice<00:01:18.920> mechanic<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> he's<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
a nice mechanic that he's here all the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
a nice mechanic that he's here all the
time<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.090> get<00:01:21.299> new<00:01:21.450> stuff<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
time and get new stuff but then I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.570 
time and get new stuff but then I
thought<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.619> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.070> about<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
thought a little bit more about it and I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
thought a little bit more about it and I
realized<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.189> there's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
realized that you know what there's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.510 
realized that you know what there's
actually<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> huge<00:01:27.570> amount<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> benefit<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
actually a huge amount of benefit that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.039 
actually a huge amount of benefit that
comes<00:01:29.549> from<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.869> could

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
comes from this because if you could

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
comes from this because if you could
stereo<00:01:31.590> oral<00:01:31.799> any<00:01:32.040> item<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> game<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
stereo oral any item in the game that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
stereo oral any item in the game that
was<00:01:33.689> legendary<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.500> say<00:01:34.619> c'est<00:01:34.920> vrai<00:01:35.250> gear
