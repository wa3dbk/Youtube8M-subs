to run the iTunes on your PC and so what
we<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.480> we've

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
we will do first is make sure that we've

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
we will do first is make sure that we've
got<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> IPA<00:00:40.230> file<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:40.770> case<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.280> would

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
got the IPA file in our case we would

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.020 
got the IPA file in our case we would
use<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.170> emotion<00:00:43.170> node<00:00:43.410> T<00:00:43.559> dot<00:00:43.710> IPA<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
use the emotion node T dot IPA which is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
use the emotion node T dot IPA which is
a<00:00:45.059> app<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.809> we've<00:00:45.989> built<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> our

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
a app that we've built for one of our

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.090 
a app that we've built for one of our
clients<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.719> would<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
clients I would use that as a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.310 
clients I would use that as a
demonstration<00:00:50.750> file<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.670> open<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
demonstration file so we would open the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.849 
demonstration file so we would open the
iTunes<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> Mac<00:00:57.079> make<00:00:58.079> sure<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.530> your

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
iTunes on the Mac make sure that your

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.000 
iTunes on the Mac make sure that your
device<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.059> connected<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.440> Mac<00:01:01.680> using

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
device is connected with your Mac using

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.060 
device is connected with your Mac using
the<00:01:02.280> cable<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.500> notice<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the cable so as you will notice when you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.750 
the cable so as you will notice when you
open<00:01:05.299> iTunes<00:01:06.299> M<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:07.260> would<00:01:07.530> show<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.950> device

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
open iTunes M it would show your device

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
open iTunes M it would show your device
on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> top<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.900> side<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> would<00:01:11.189> say

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
on the top right side so I would say

could<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> once<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.700> ready

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
could do that too so once we are ready
we<00:01:33.360> click<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.259> iPhone<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.509> iPhone<00:01:36.979> option

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
here on the top right and then it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.800 
here on the top right and then it
basically<00:01:41.130> shows<00:01:41.490> us<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> details<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

basically shows us the details of the
device<00:01:43.110> connected<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
device connected so in this case it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.139 
device connected so in this case it
would<00:01:44.700> show<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> details<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.600> my<00:01:45.840> phone<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
would show the details of my phone and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.819 
would show the details of my phone and
we<00:01:48.149> would<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.720> apps<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.560> top<00:01:49.740> you

we would then go to apps on the top you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
we would then go to apps on the top you
would<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.159> summary<00:01:50.520> info<00:01:50.970> etc<00:01:51.090> etc<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.960> we

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
would see summary info etc etc so we

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
would see summary info etc etc so we
would<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> apps<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.600> want

and<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.590> app<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.890> install<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and the app would install but now it's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.139 
and the app would install but now it's
you<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.340> reason<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> doesn't

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you know some for some reason it doesn't

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.059 
you know some for some reason it doesn't
happen<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> would<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.950> do

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
happen now so what you would need to do

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.830 
happen now so what you would need to do
is<00:02:11.310> bring<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.270> IPA<00:02:12.780> file<00:02:13.140> onto

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is bring the IPA file onto

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.020 
is bring the IPA file onto
the<00:02:13.930> library<00:02:14.410> here<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.280> what<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.550> would<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.849> is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the library here so what we would do is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.880 
the library here so what we would do is
go<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.569> file<00:02:17.019> click<00:02:17.349> on<00:02:17.800> iTunes<00:02:18.430> go<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.819> file

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
go to file click on iTunes go to file

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.550 
go to file click on iTunes go to file
and<00:02:20.890> then<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.519> add<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.030> library<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.690> then

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and then go to add to library and then

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.100 
and then go to add to library and then
select<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.099> file<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:25.090> our<00:02:25.300> case<00:02:25.660> we<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
select the file in our case we have the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.740 
select the file in our case we have the
motion<00:02:26.470> noted<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.010> IPA<00:02:27.430> file<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.300> add<00:02:28.510> this

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
motion noted on IPA file so add this

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.259 
motion noted on IPA file so add this
file<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.349> library<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.000> already

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
file on to the library if you already

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.119 
file on to the library if you already
have<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> file<00:02:32.019> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.290> library<00:02:32.799> it<00:02:32.980> would

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
have the file on the library it would

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.000 
have the file on the library it would
ask<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> replace<00:02:33.940> or<00:02:34.209> not<00:02:34.540> replace<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.200> my

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
ask you to replace or not replace in my

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.320 
ask you to replace or not replace in my
case<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.370> would<00:02:36.430> just<00:02:36.700> say<00:02:36.849> replace<00:02:37.150> because

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
case I would just say replace because

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.780 
case I would just say replace because
this<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.840> an<00:02:37.989> updated<00:02:38.379> version<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.430> IPA

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this is an updated version of the IPA

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.750 
this is an updated version of the IPA
file<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.170> click<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.590> replace<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.489> I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
file so I just click on replace now I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.680 
file so I just click on replace now I
have<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.650> IPA<00:02:44.650> file<00:02:45.010> here<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.849> left<00:02:46.510> hand

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
have the IPA file here on the left hand

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.949 
have the IPA file here on the left hand
side<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:48.430> as<00:02:48.610> simple<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.420> all<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.840> need

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
side and it's as simple you all you need

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.740 
side and it's as simple you all you need
to<00:02:50.079> do<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.319> click<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.590> install<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:52.569> would

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
to do is click on install now it would

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.490 
to do is click on install now it would
say<00:02:52.930> will<00:02:53.200> install<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.130> obviously<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.630> would

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
say will install and obviously it would

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.530 
say will install and obviously it would
not<00:02:56.650> install<00:02:57.130> unless<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.700> click<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:58.060> apply<00:02:58.360> at

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
not install unless you click on apply at

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.569 
not install unless you click on apply at
the<00:02:58.690> bottom<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> choice<00:02:59.769> of<00:03:00.040> you

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
the bottom so you have the choice of you

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.839 
the bottom so you have the choice of you
know<00:03:00.700> removing<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.209> if<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.450> want<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.700> our

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
know removing it if you want but in our

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.229 
know removing it if you want but in our
case<00:03:04.090> we<00:03:04.269> would<00:03:04.390> click<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.690> apply<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:06.239> then

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
case we would click on apply and then

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
install the app on your device as you

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.349 
install the app on your device as you
can<00:03:40.540> see<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> have<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.620> white<00:03:42.310> blank<00:03:42.790> icon

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
can see I have this white blank icon

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.089 
can see I have this white blank icon
which<00:03:43.989> means<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.650> app<00:03:44.829> would<00:03:45.040> be

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
which means that the app would be

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.030 
which means that the app would be
installed<00:03:45.609> on<00:03:45.849> mice<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.510> my<00:03:46.989> iPhone<00:03:47.470> on<00:03:47.739> page

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
installed on mice on my iPhone on page

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.940 
installed on mice on my iPhone on page
two<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.389> would<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.780> scroll<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
two so I would have to scroll to see the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.270 
two so I would have to scroll to see the
app<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.400> my<00:03:51.579> on<00:03:52.329> my<00:03:52.480> device<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:53.049> you<00:03:53.739> can<00:03:53.889> see<00:03:54.040> on

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
app on my on my device as you can see on

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.000 
app on my on my device as you can see on
the<00:03:54.400> top<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.790> says<00:03:54.849> finishing<00:03:55.750> sync<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.260> now

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
the top it says finishing sync and now

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.610

the<00:03:57.069> app<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.489> installed<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.450> what<00:03:59.169> we<00:03:59.290> would<00:03:59.440> do

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
the app is installed so what we would do

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.309 
the app is installed so what we would do
is<00:03:59.889> go<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.669> device<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.209> check<00:04:04.319> still

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
is go to the device to check still

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.990 
is go to the device to check still
installing<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.870> since<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.260> big<00:04:08.739> app<00:04:09.000> it's

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
installing and since it's a big app it's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 
installing and since it's a big app it's
basically<00:04:10.540> taking<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.530> know<00:04:11.620> some<00:04:11.799> time

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
basically taking you know some time

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.080 
basically taking you know some time
otherwise<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.489> should<00:04:12.669> be<00:04:12.819> straightforward

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
otherwise it should be straightforward

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.460 
otherwise it should be straightforward
quick<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:15.220> yep<00:04:15.700> my<00:04:16.060> app<00:04:16.329> is<00:04:16.539> now<00:04:16.660> installed<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
quick so yep my app is now installed and

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.890 
quick so yep my app is now installed and
you<00:04:18.070> would<00:04:18.220> see<00:04:18.430> there's<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.880> small<00:04:19.690> icon

you would see there's this small icon

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.200 
you would see there's this small icon
here<00:04:20.289> called<00:04:20.650> n<00:04:20.829> which<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.489> for<00:04:21.700> no<00:04:21.849> T<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210
