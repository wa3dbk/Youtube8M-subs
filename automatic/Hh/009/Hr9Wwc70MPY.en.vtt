00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.799
 good to all we will see the exercise 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.200
 from one arm a butterfly arm this 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.179
 exercise is done just like that of breaststroke 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 only that butterfly is worth and let's see the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 same two variants with a small 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.849
 except if in brace and we are going to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 always breathing every stroke though 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.939
 we only had one arm in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 butterfly I like to do it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 breathing every stroke so we can 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.300
 to experience let's say a variant inside 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.070
 of this variant so to speak a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.720
 agreement then the first variant of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.720
 all is with one arm 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.450
 one is nothing to love and normal thing just 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 that with an arm on the occasion the arm 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 it does not come out as lateral as when we arrived 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.059
 the two arms does not prevent you 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 shoulder flexibility comes out a little more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 up but let's go breathing towards 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.629
 forward instead of to the side as 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.030
 did as we do in neutral and so on 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.430
 one we breathe others we breathe 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 when we breathe a help let's say to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.180
 pull out your head just like in a breaststroke to see 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.400
 what are we going to waste water postures and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.619
 when we breathe, we paste the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.690
 chin we adopt we will get that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.220
 position of minimum resistance and also 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.800
 we set the trajectory of the arm by 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.410
 under the water the other arm will go 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 forward stretched as a guide arm 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.740
 that has to go parallel to the wall 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.960
 parallel to the cork 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.030
 the other variant as in breaststroke 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.360
 would be to swim to an arm in arm 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.250
 but with the other arm attached to the body 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.259
 let's breathe this time every 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.939
 two strokes in breaststroke and we go every 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.399
 buy lazada here let's go breathing 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.659
 each stroke as it happened 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.179
 females we have to try to keep 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.159
 the shoulders in line that remain 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.869
 always the same plane of agreement now 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.610
 it will be easier for me to take the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.229
 head forward because before 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.030
 when he had his arm here it turns out 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.590
 as more uncomfortable because the shoulder does not 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.850
 allows it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.570
 so now that I have the shoulder of 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.750
 another deep here is not trying to go giving 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.240
 gives a respite dismissal and the same as if 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.830
 were two arms if I go to one side 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.960
 If I go to the other, I get the right 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.300
 head is because I'm not doing well 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.970
 the stroke then this way I'm 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.970
 learning alone unconsciously 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.299
 to bring the arm inside the water 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.709
 how does it have to be carried later 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.629
 transfer that has this kind of 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.209
 exercises to the complete swim is that if 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.980
 I can do it with a good arm 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.620
 and that arm is strengthened well and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.299
 unconsciously taught the route 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.579
 you have to follow the arm inside 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.860
 of the water when you do it with two arms 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.769
 it's going to be much easier for me and I'm going to 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.480
 to be able to focus on other aspects more 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 Global agree now to himself 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 we are starting what we are doing 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.980
 more analytical way 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.090
 for me the only surprise for me the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.470
 only reason 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.330
 that we can find to make a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.709
 Butterfly arm term is because no 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.739
 we have the strength to do it with both 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.129
 It is the stylish butterfly that requires 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.410
 much strength to practice if you like that 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.360
 you name an arm you can talk technique 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.150
 the coordination of the stroke with the 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.550
 kick a comfortable way and lets you 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.960
 do the subway 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.069
 Do exercises of 100 meters with 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.749
 comfort 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.459
 then that would be basically for 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.349
 strengthen us 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.569
 to be able to do it to help do 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.769
 butterfly without the effort that the person 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 with both arms costs a lot of 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.249
 work and in exchange for many people who 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.780
 they are starting are unable to do it 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.519
 with what others are females maximum is going to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.739
 know how it's going to be more than 50 meters the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.840
 change then the butterfly will be made and 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.980
 make 200 meters of lighting an arm and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.500
 that when legs communication 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.099
 breathing arm movement by the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.189
 water the forces watching the chaste more 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.510
 special things you can talk about take it 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.569
 this change with the two tables at once 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.450
 many people can 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.730
 that's why in the Sunday we make purchases 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.250
 an arm 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.560
 In short, we could say that the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.440
 make an arm an arm with the styles 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 symmetrical the embers and the butterfly we 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.870
 serves to help us do the side 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.019
 later to strengthen to compensate 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.330
 to focus the swim to teach the 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.400
 route and learn the route let's say the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.739
 arm attraction from form 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.739
 unconscious proprioceptively 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.620
 anything else 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.840
 he wears heels for that is why it seems 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 so tall
