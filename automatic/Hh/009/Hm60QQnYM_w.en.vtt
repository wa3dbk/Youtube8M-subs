00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
the ten percent strength and I just use

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.699 
the ten percent strength and I just use
it<00:02:57.849> probably<00:02:58.090> once<00:02:58.719> a<00:02:58.870> week<00:02:59.079> maybe<00:02:59.349> twice<00:02:59.469> a

it probably once a week maybe twice a
week<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:01.239> know<00:03:01.329> I'll<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.510> put<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.959> all<00:03:02.109> over

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
week you know I'll just put it all over

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.990 
my face in a thin layer and it really it
makes<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.919> visible<00:03:06.280> difference<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.790> next

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
makes a visible difference the next

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.800 
makes a visible difference the next
morning<00:03:07.269> my<00:03:07.450> skin<00:03:07.739> benzoyl<00:03:08.739> peroxide

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
morning my skin benzoyl peroxide

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
morning my skin benzoyl peroxide
actually<00:03:10.810> kills<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.290> bacteria<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:12.069> causes

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
actually kills the bacteria that causes

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.080 
actually kills the bacteria that causes
acne<00:03:13.799> it's<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:15.189> it's<00:03:15.459> also<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.760> bleaching

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
acne it's just it's also a bleaching

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.860 
acne it's just it's also a bleaching
agent<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.989> will<00:03:17.340> reduce<00:03:18.449> if<00:03:19.449> you<00:03:19.599> have<00:03:19.690> acne

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
agent so it will reduce if you have acne

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.780 
agent so it will reduce if you have acne
scars<00:03:20.379> like<00:03:20.620> those<00:03:20.829> brown<00:03:21.099> spots<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.669> you
