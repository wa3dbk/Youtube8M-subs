00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so it's really simple you can make it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.840

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
didn't go out of his way to play these
parts<00:00:52.409> you<00:00:52.559> made<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.010> simple<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.579> he<00:00:53.729> can't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
parts you made it as simple as he can't

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
parts you made it as simple as he can't
possibly<00:00:54.390> could<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:00.870> simple<00:01:00.929> that<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
possibly could to see how simple that is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470 
possibly could to see how simple that is
it<00:01:01.829> doesn't<00:01:02.190> take<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.519> effort<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.149> once

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it doesn't take much effort at all once

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.290 
it doesn't take much effort at all once
you<00:01:03.660> learn<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.929> techniques<00:01:05.300> another

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
you learn the techniques another

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.350 
you learn the techniques another

Mitchell I really really loved is the
intro<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.660> remember<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.950> probably<00:01:11.220> mess<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
intro to remember I'm probably mess it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
intro to remember I'm probably mess it
up<00:01:11.789> so<00:01:12.030> give<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.600> second<00:01:13.259> to<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:13.410> about<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
up so give me a second to think about it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
up so give me a second to think about it
now<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.190> add<00:01:14.369> ing<00:01:14.759> slides<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.630> he's

using this really nice country style to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
using this really nice country style to
augment<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.200> get

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
augment so it's something like this get

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.550 
augment so it's something like this get
a<00:01:22.590> nice<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.460> guitar
