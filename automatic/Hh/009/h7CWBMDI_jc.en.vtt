but<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.809> wondering<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.680> extended<00:00:41.190> dlc

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
but I was wondering on the extended dlc

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
but I was wondering on the extended dlc
that's<00:00:41.820> coming<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.420> Batman<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.930> personally

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's coming up for Batman I personally

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.610 
that's coming up for Batman I personally
think<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.550> having<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.940> Suicide<00:00:45.510> Squad<00:00:45.719> would

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
think that having a Suicide Squad would

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.640 
think that having a Suicide Squad would
be<00:00:46.770> too<00:00:47.040> huge<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.790> DLC<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> should

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
be too huge for a DLC and that it should

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.650 
be too huge for a DLC and that it should
be<00:00:49.829> saved<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> next<00:00:50.550> game<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.420> your

be saved for the next game in your
personal<00:00:52.079> opinion<00:00:52.380> do<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.250> they

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
personal opinion do you think that they

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.690 
personal opinion do you think that they
would<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.760> more<00:00:54.060> for<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.600> Batgirl<00:00:55.200> DLC<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.220> Robin

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
would go more for a Batgirl DLC or Robin

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.389 
would go more for a Batgirl DLC or Robin

the<00:03:04.860> opening<00:03:05.280> would<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.550> something<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the opening would be something like a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.720 
the opening would be something like a
cutscene<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.750> her<00:03:07.170> getting<00:03:07.980> shot<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.610> back

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.120 
to the point where she is paralyzed and
then<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.780> kind<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.140> progresses<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> couple

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
then it kind of progresses a couple

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.190 
then it kind of progresses a couple
years<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.910> Arkham<00:03:15.330> City<00:03:15.600> happened<00:03:16.080> and

whatnot and she's okay eventually

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
whatnot and she's okay eventually

would<00:03:50.160> work<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:51.209> because<00:03:51.860> maybe<00:03:52.860> like<00:03:53.850> this

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
would work is because maybe like this

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.729 
would work is because maybe like this
this<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.570> what<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:54.959> kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.380> pauses<00:03:55.620> me
