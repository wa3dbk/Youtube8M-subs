shell on the outside there is resistance

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
shell on the outside there is resistance
right<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.160> see<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.550> actually

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
breathe a little bit I suppose

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.990 
breathe a little bit I suppose
completely<00:01:45.000> open<00:01:45.480> on<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.690> bottom<00:01:46.580> these<00:01:47.580> are

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
completely open on the bottom these are

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
completely open on the bottom these are
little<00:01:48.810> bumps<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.530> raised<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.610> see

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
little bumps are raised as you can see

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
little bumps are raised as you can see
right<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> can't<00:01:52.590> access<00:01:52.800> them<00:01:53.100> i

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
right there so you can't access them i

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
right there so you can't access them i
found<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.700> they're<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.180> harder

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570

it's very very recessed in there so

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.309 
it's very very recessed in there so
pretty<00:02:57.310> nice<00:02:57.489> adds<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.660> bit<00:02:58.810> more<00:02:59.049> bulk

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
pretty nice adds a little bit more bulk

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
suppose after time they will get to

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.280 
suppose after time they will get to
leave<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.420> I'm<00:03:22.510> trying<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.840> push<00:03:23.049> them<00:03:23.200> right

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
up here there's a little bit of a cutout

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.879 
up here there's a little bit of a cutout
so<00:03:46.750> when<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.930> put<00:03:47.079> your<00:03:47.109> headphones<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.739> there

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
so when you put your headphones in there

so when you put your headphones in there
it's<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.459> going<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.670> hit<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.880> plastic

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
it's not going to hit that plastic

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.809 
it's not going to hit that plastic
that's<00:03:49.720> kind<00:03:49.989> of<00:03:50.049> nice<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:51.069> is<00:03:51.280> pretty<00:03:51.519> thin

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
that's kind of nice this is pretty thin

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:52.890 
that's kind of nice this is pretty thin
though<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.209> if<00:03:52.269> you're<00:03:52.389> going<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.569> be<00:03:52.660> taking

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
though so if you're going to be taking

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.099 
though so if you're going to be taking
this<00:03:52.989> case<00:03:53.200> on<00:03:53.410> an<00:03:53.709> off<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:54.609> they<00:03:55.569> experience

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
this case on an off I they experience

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.250 
this case on an off I they experience
with<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.380> iphone<00:03:56.790> ones<00:03:57.810> when<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.840> take<00:03:59.109> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
with the iphone ones when you take it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.870 
with the iphone ones when you take it
off<00:03:59.350> this<00:03:59.799> will<00:04:00.010> crack<00:04:00.280> right<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.730> middle

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
off this will crack right in the middle

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.460 
off this will crack right in the middle
so<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.540> still<00:04:01.750> hooked<00:04:01.959> together<00:04:02.109> with<00:04:02.410> the
