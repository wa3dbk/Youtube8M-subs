worst fear on this was doing like the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.300

curve<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.120> arch<00:01:42.330> because<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.200> had<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
curve in the arch because I had the the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.150 
curve in the arch because I had the the
basic<00:01:44.820> layout<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.770> arch<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:49.160> one

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
basic layout for the arch as just one

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.360 
basic layout for the arch as just one
block<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.260> had<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.620> work<00:01:52.800> out<00:01:53.070> there's

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
block and then I had to work out there's

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.940 
block and then I had to work out there's
like<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.610> crossover<00:01:54.210> point<00:01:54.690> here<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.260> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
like a crossover point here and that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.330 
like a crossover point here and that
just<00:01:56.280> took<00:01:56.520> absolutely<00:01:57.110> ages<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.920> work<00:01:59.100> out

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
just took absolutely ages to work out

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.300 
just took absolutely ages to work out
which<00:01:59.520> way<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> went<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:01.050> leads<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> one

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
which way it went this leads up to one

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
which way it went this leads up to one
of<00:02:02.430> our<00:02:02.580> new<00:02:02.730> creations<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.510> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.140> store

I'll<00:02:25.170> show<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.950> what's<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:26.940> on

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
I'll show you what it is what's going on

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.600 
I'll show you what it is what's going on
so<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> stairs<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:34.099> out<00:02:35.099> here

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so we go out up the stairs and out here

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.570 
so we go out up the stairs and out here
is<00:02:35.819> one<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.450> our<00:02:36.630> sort<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.110> stations<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
is one of our sort of stations as you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.990 
is one of our sort of stations as you
can<00:02:38.700> see<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.500> two-layer<00:02:40.500> station<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.459> train

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.270 
can see a two-layer station with train
tracks<00:02:42.269> on<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.989> these<00:02:43.319> stations<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.980> all

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
tracks on and these stations go all

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.630 
tracks on and these stations go all
around<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:45.030> main<00:02:45.390> sensor<00:02:45.900> off<00:02:46.019> our<00:02:46.200> map<00:02:46.640> in

around the main sensor off our map in
each<00:02:47.880> direction<00:02:48.120> you'll<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.459> trained<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640

the<00:02:57.599> map<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.170> rather<00:02:58.590> than<00:02:58.709> walking<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.430> night

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459

if<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.090> keep<00:03:00.239> mobs<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.319> probably<00:03:01.650> get<00:03:01.860> hurt

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
if we keep mobs on you probably get hurt

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.250 
if we keep mobs on you probably get hurt
or<00:03:02.340> Doyle's<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:03.030> mean<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:03.989> use<00:03:04.110> these

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
or Doyle's I mean so you can use these

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.370

Redstone<00:03:10.110> say<00:03:10.410> where<00:03:10.620> need<00:03:10.769> Barry<00:03:11.040> about

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
Redstone say where need Barry about

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.830 
Redstone say where need Barry about
pushing<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.060> along<00:03:14.209> as<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.330> will<00:03:15.420> see<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.720> be

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
pushing it along as you will see to be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.509 
pushing it along as you will see to be
various<00:03:16.200> stops<00:03:16.440> where<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.799> can<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:17.040> off<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
various stops where you can get off and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.190 
various stops where you can get off and
you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.760> build<00:03:17.970> houses<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:18.720> since<00:03:19.079> then

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you can build houses there since then

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.810 
you can build houses there since then
you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.410> always<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.950> pop<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.400> train<00:03:20.640> and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
you can always just pop on the train and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.550 
you can always just pop on the train and
go<00:03:20.940> back<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.720> spawn<00:03:21.959> area<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.410> main

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
go back to the spawn area the main

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710 
go back to the spawn area the main
community<00:03:23.100> area<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.239> then<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.600> each

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
community area and then you can each

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.360 
community area and then you can each
have<00:03:24.930> your<00:03:25.200> own<00:03:25.260> sort<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.620> friends<00:03:25.980> area<00:03:26.250> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
have your own sort of friends area and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.610 
have your own sort of friends area and
build<00:03:26.609> your<00:03:26.670> own<00:03:26.820> houses<00:03:27.510> every<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.079> often<00:03:28.260> I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
build your own houses every so often I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.559 
build your own houses every so often I
think<00:03:29.220> Aaron's<00:03:29.549> built<00:03:29.790> some<00:03:30.000> creations<00:03:30.420> up

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
think Aaron's built some creations up

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.030 
think Aaron's built some creations up
here<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:30.900> we're<00:03:31.049> probably<00:03:31.260> go<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.709> show<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
here if we're probably go and show you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.930 
here if we're probably go and show you
it's<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:32.850> up<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.480> further<00:03:33.750> II<00:03:33.900> think

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it's just up here but further II think

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.330 
it's just up here but further II think
most<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.120> these<00:03:36.269> have<00:03:36.540> been<00:03:36.660> done<00:03:37.140> or<00:03:37.739> quite

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
most of these have been done or quite

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.460 
most of these have been done or quite
late<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.180> after<00:03:39.510> I've<00:03:39.900> been<00:03:39.930> back<00:03:40.260> from

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
late and I after I've been back from

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.309 
late and I after I've been back from
work<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.700> needed<00:03:42.180> something<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.660> do<00:03:45.139> as<00:03:46.139> you

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
work and I needed something to do as you

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.349 
work and I needed something to do as you
see<00:03:46.530> some<00:03:46.769> stations<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.519> little<00:03:47.730> bit<00:03:47.819> different

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
see some stations a little bit different

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.390 
see some stations a little bit different
some<00:03:48.690> land<00:03:49.049> like<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.350> one<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.769> lands<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.220> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
some land like this one here lands on to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.520 
some land like this one here lands on to
like<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> big<00:03:50.819> tree<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.510> try<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.750> keep<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
like a big tree we try to keep it in the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.530 
like a big tree we try to keep it in the
same<00:03:52.709> sort<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:52.980> style<00:03:53.190> off<00:03:53.609> where<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.420> actual

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
same sort of style off where the actual

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.160

station<00:03:54.989> or<00:03:55.109> land<00:03:55.380> as<00:03:56.340> you'll<00:03:56.549> see<00:03:57.079> most<00:03:58.079> of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
station or land as you'll see most of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.289 
station or land as you'll see most of
the<00:03:58.260> train<00:03:58.560> stations<00:03:58.920> they<00:03:59.100> will<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.850> swim

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
the train stations they will have a swim

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.240 
the train stations they will have a swim
port<00:04:00.569> bomb<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.410> quickly<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:02.010> jump

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
port bomb so you can quickly just jump

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.300 
port bomb so you can quickly just jump
off<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.489> top<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.700> land<00:04:02.940> in<00:04:03.090> swamp<00:04:03.389> all<00:04:04.310> look

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
off the top and land in swamp all look

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.360 
off the top and land in swamp all look
like<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.639> zoots<00:04:05.880> bill<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.989> mull<00:04:07.769> over<00:04:08.010> here

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
like a zoots bill to mull over here

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.340 
like a zoots bill to mull over here
joint<00:04:09.060> thighs<00:04:09.680> yeah<00:04:11.000> these<00:04:12.000> didn't<00:04:12.959> really

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
joint thighs yeah these didn't really

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.370 
joint thighs yeah these didn't really
take<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.950> long<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.489> do<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.720> only<00:04:15.989> thing

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
take that long to do that the only thing

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.029 
take that long to do that the only thing
really<00:04:17.280> was<00:04:17.669> working<00:04:18.600> out<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.870> scale<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.620> how

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
really was working out the scale and how

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.029 
really was working out the scale and how
many<00:04:20.220> pixels<00:04:20.489> there<00:04:20.940> were<00:04:21.650> probably<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:22.890> you

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
many pixels there were probably if you

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.430 
many pixels there were probably if you
see<00:04:23.340> some<00:04:23.580> holes<00:04:24.510> in

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
see some holes in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.620 
see some holes in
in<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.190> mobs<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:26.730> because<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.120> end<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.450> men

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
in the mobs it's because the end of men

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.070 
in the mobs it's because the end of men
keep<00:04:28.230> spawning<00:04:29.130> inside<00:04:29.790> because<00:04:30.120> most<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
keep spawning inside because most of the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.620 
keep spawning inside because most of the
way<00:04:31.200> through<00:04:31.230> their<00:04:31.740> hollow<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.390> they<00:04:33.390> just

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
way through their hollow and they just

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.490 
way through their hollow and they just
take<00:04:34.200> blocks<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.830> wool<00:04:35.040> out<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.870> then<00:04:37.140> over

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
take blocks of wool out and then over

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.800 
take blocks of wool out and then over
here<00:04:37.530> we<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:38.520> pre<00:04:38.970> creations<00:04:39.450> you'll<00:04:39.600> see

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
here we have pre creations you'll see

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.260 
here we have pre creations you'll see
that<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.770> I'll<00:04:41.700> show<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:41.970> them<00:04:42.120> and

that is the I'll show you them and
apparently<00:04:42.990> over<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.070> big<00:04:44.250> maze<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
apparently over here is the big maze the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.580 
apparently over here is the big maze the
errand<00:04:45.000> made<00:04:45.180> seems<00:04:45.780> he's<00:04:45.960> put<00:04:46.110> some<00:04:46.290> trees

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
errand made seems he's put some trees

as you'll see this is on the ocean so

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.290 
as you'll see this is on the ocean so
we've<00:06:14.620> built<00:06:14.889> a<00:06:15.040> sort<00:06:15.280> of<00:06:15.340> plot<00:06:15.580> area<00:06:15.850> where

we've built a sort of plot area where
players<00:06:16.810> can<00:06:16.960> come<00:06:17.139> in<00:06:17.410> build<00:06:17.650> during<00:06:17.860> houses

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
players can come in build during houses

on<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.699> water<00:06:18.940> right<00:06:19.360> that's<00:06:19.539> more<00:06:19.840> house

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
on the water right that's more house

on the water right that's more house
over<00:06:20.320> there<00:06:20.470> and<00:06:21.250> this<00:06:21.430> has<00:06:21.669> its<00:06:21.880> own<00:06:22.030> sort<00:06:22.449> of

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
over there and this has its own sort of

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.480 
over there and this has its own sort of
like<00:06:22.660> a<00:06:22.690> big<00:06:22.840> boat<00:06:23.080> dock<00:06:23.380> where<00:06:23.800> players<00:06:24.160> can

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
use the boats to Eva dock into this and

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.840 
use the boats to Eva dock into this and
come<00:06:27.759> back<00:06:27.880> to<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.150> home<00:06:28.360> or<00:06:28.630> go<00:06:29.169> and<00:06:29.410> explore

come back to the home or go and explore

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.520 
come back to the home or go and explore
but<00:06:30.850> if<00:06:30.940> there<00:06:31.150> is<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:31.660> covered<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.289> around

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
with a big massive for so it should be a

mob Prine creeper free so it's quite
well<00:06:38.440> fortified<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:39.220> he's<00:06:40.120> also<00:06:40.360> equally
