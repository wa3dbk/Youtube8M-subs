00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello the high-normans today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.069
 we are going to talk about verbena 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 citronella how to maintain it how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.879
 the plant is and how to taste it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.459
 how is the plant and it's very simple 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.950
 he needs a well- drained ground and 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.130
 especially the sun the better it is against 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.050
 a south facing wall will require the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.030
 protect the winter, that is to say at the foot m 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.510
 straw leaves and a veil 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.900
 wintering 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 that's all there is to do then 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 how the plant and as usual 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.260
 make a hole double the pot at the bottom 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 of the hole so as she needs to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.469
 drainage we can put about ten 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.629
 towns of pebbles especially let's not forget 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.659
 not the fertilizer a natural fertilizer well 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.789
 sure we move on we water and that's 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.949
 all there is to do 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.199
 so of course how to maintain it 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.699
 speak not much except a little 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.649
 of aphids so as usual with 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.239
 a little bit of orting rank or any other 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 product that could remove the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.929
 Aphid it will not too loved the pink 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 a little bit anyway 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.489
 and also there we come to a period a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.199
 little chilly it will be necessary to make 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 cuttings so how to achieve 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.630
 cuttings a sentence sale on the foot 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 mother roughly a 5 to 10 cm stem to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.899
 about with two or three leaves and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 we cut just below them 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.259
 usually like all plantations 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.460
 pay every grind we put 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.460
 that in a very light potting soil 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.000
 and we're going to put it to the muffled on 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.610
 will have about 15 days ie to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.920
 smothered under a plastic bag or 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.840
 plastic hours and we will remove 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.360
 to place himself only about two to three 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.010
 hours a day to prevent the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.380
 condensation a moisture not help 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.120
 the cutting and you'll realize pretty much 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 cuttings after a month or so 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.460
 close then of course it will be necessary to leave it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 push both when we're pretty much 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.520
 at thirty or forty or so 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.190
 leaves from there we can take on 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 do of course added drinks 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.510
 like infusions but also the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.850
 fruit salads and green salads 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.570
 this is the end of this chronicle 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.010
 we talked about verbena 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.960
 Lemongrass do not forget it's a 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.729
 excellent aromatic plant the tea them 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 infusions and especially the chicken and the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.820
 chicken with lemon it's excellent me 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.820
 tell you next week
