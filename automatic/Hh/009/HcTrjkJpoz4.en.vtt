I'm<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.660> instead<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> transcendence<00:00:37.770> at

I'm using instead of transcendence at

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.549 
I'm using instead of transcendence at
the<00:00:37.950> moment<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.399> swapping<00:00:38.850> out

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
the moment which is swapping out

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
the moment which is swapping out
obviously<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.640> help<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.120> back

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
obviously you're the help you get back

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.940 
obviously you're the help you get back
on<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.780> every<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.320> spirit<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> spend

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
on for every point of spirit you spend

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
on for every point of spirit you spend
but<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> haven't<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.059> any<00:00:45.210> health<00:00:45.420> club

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
healing bonus at the moment anyway so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.670 
healing bonus at the moment anyway so
I'm<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.129> suffering<00:00:47.489> too<00:00:47.640> much<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
I'm not suffering too much from that and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.410 
I'm not suffering too much from that and
recently<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.430> couple<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> piece<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> year

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
recently with a couple of piece of year

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
recently with a couple of piece of year
ago<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.930> big<00:00:52.050> boost<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.469> life<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.100> hit

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
ago really big boost to my life on hit

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.319 
ago really big boost to my life on hit
so<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.670> too<00:00:53.730> worried<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.210> my

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
so I'm not too worried about my

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
so I'm not too worried about my
survivability<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> moment<00:00:55.410> anyways<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
survivability at the moment anyways the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.400 
survivability at the moment anyways the
trading<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.370> isn't<00:00:56.760> too<00:00:56.879> bad<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.289> with

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
trading now isn't too bad the thing with

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.660 
trading now isn't too bad the thing with
mythic<00:00:58.680> rhythm<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.070> apparently<00:00:59.399> works<00:00:59.550> with

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
mythic rhythm is apparently works with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.220 
mythic rhythm is apparently works with
every<00:01:00.120> single<00:01:00.300> spirit<00:01:00.660> generator<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
every single spirit generator in the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.660 
every single spirit generator in the
game<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.520> powerful

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
game which is really really powerful

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.999 
game which is really really powerful
when<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> comes<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.719> using<00:01:04.619> sweeping

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
when it comes to them using sweeping

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.039 
when it comes to them using sweeping
wind<00:01:05.219> so<00:01:05.819> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.029> get<00:01:06.179> three<00:01:06.569> hits<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:06.959> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
wind so if you get three hits from a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
wind so if you get three hits from a
spirit<00:01:07.289> generation<00:01:07.679> and<00:01:07.770> activate<00:01:08.130> sweeping

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
spirit generation and activate sweeping

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
spirit generation and activate sweeping
wind<00:01:08.759> as<00:01:09.299> long<00:01:09.509> as<00:01:09.539> you<00:01:09.689> keep<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.990> sweeping

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
wind as long as you keep that sweeping

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.260 
wind as long as you keep that sweeping
wind<00:01:10.649> up<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> doing<00:01:11.189> forty<00:01:11.639> percent<00:01:11.909> extra

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
wind up is doing forty percent extra

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
wind up is doing forty percent extra
damage<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.709> know<00:01:13.740> sweeping<00:01:14.670> wind

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
damage which we all know sweeping wind

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.859 
damage which we all know sweeping wind
does<00:01:14.969> enough<00:01:15.420> damage<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:17.029> but<00:01:18.029> for<00:01:18.329> for

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
does enough damage as it is but for for

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.059 
does enough damage as it is but for for
there<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.109> that<00:01:19.349> that<00:01:19.469> extra<00:01:19.829> forty

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
there to be that that extra forty

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.529 
there to be that that extra forty
percent<00:01:20.310> damage<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.729> top<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.029> is<00:01:21.179> going<00:01:21.389> to<00:01:21.450> be

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
percent damage on top is is going to be

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.719 
percent damage on top is is going to be
really<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.929> powerful<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.529> it<00:01:23.189> also<00:01:23.340> means

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
really really powerful and it also means

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
really really powerful and it also means
that<00:01:24.060> while<00:01:24.779> you're<00:01:24.990> sleeping<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.499> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that while you're sleeping when is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
that while you're sleeping when is
active<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.219> you're<00:01:26.340> still<00:01:26.579> hitting<00:01:26.819> three

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
active if you're still hitting three

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.909 
active if you're still hitting three
times<00:01:27.539> with<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.139> spirit<00:01:28.409> generator<00:01:28.709> and<00:01:28.799> then

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:28.919 
times with a spirit generator and then

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:30.409 
times with a spirit generator and then
lashing<00:01:29.279> tail<00:01:29.490> kick<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.060> doing

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:30.419 
lashing tail kick that's doing

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.569 
lashing tail kick that's doing
additional<00:01:30.779> damage<00:01:31.139> as<00:01:31.289> well<00:01:31.319> and<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
additional damage as well and so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
additional damage as well and so
literally<00:01:32.880> any<00:01:33.090> skill<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.719> involves<00:01:34.319> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
literally any skill that involves you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.349 
literally any skill that involves you
you're<00:01:34.799> spinning<00:01:34.979> spirit<00:01:35.429> however<00:01:35.999> I<00:01:36.090> don't

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
you're spinning spirit however I don't

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.719 
you're spinning spirit however I don't
believe<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> works<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.499> the<00:01:38.069> active<00:01:38.459> part

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
believe it works on the the active part

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
believe it works on the the active part
of<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.029> mattress<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.770> though<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
of your mattress so even though it's

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.519 
of your mattress so even though it's
forty<00:01:41.399> percent<00:01:41.639> extra<00:01:41.969> damage<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:43.349> think

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:43.529 
forty percent extra damage I don't think

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.139 
forty percent extra damage I don't think
you'll<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.739> forty<00:01:44.069> percent<00:01:44.279> of<00:01:44.429> the<00:01:44.520> 202

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you'll get forty percent of the 202

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.580 
you'll get forty percent of the 202
percent<00:01:45.509> damage<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.929> returning<00:01:46.289> for<00:01:46.560> a

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
percent damage your returning for a

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.050 
percent damage your returning for a
match<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.950> retribution<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.579> instance<00:01:47.909> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
match of retribution for instance I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.479 
match of retribution for instance I
haven't<00:01:48.989> fully<00:01:49.079> tested<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.590> yet<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.279> I<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:50.489 
haven't fully tested that yet but I can

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.269 
haven't fully tested that yet but I can
look<00:01:50.609> into<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.739> some<00:01:52.739> mythic<00:01:53.009> rhythm

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
look into that and some mythic rhythm

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.179 
look into that and some mythic rhythm
really<00:01:53.609> comes<00:01:53.819> into<00:01:53.969> play<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.539> you're<00:01:54.659> using

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
really comes into play when you're using

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.979 
really comes into play when you're using

should use it initially to get sweeping
wind-ups<00:02:00.209> do<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> forty<00:02:00.689> percent<00:02:00.869> extra

wind-ups do the forty percent extra
damage<00:02:01.349> and<00:02:01.679> then<00:02:02.069> after<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.429> you<00:02:02.609> should<00:02:02.639> be

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
should do that as it is higher dps

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.509 
should do that as it is higher dps
rather<00:02:30.239> than<00:02:30.510> spending<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.739> I

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
rather than spending the time and I

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.190 
rather than spending the time and I
believe<00:02:32.849> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.420> any<00:02:33.599> attack<00:02:33.989> speed

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
believe this is up to any attack speed

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.530 
believe this is up to any attack speed
but<00:02:34.349> I've<00:02:34.470> tested<00:02:34.920> anyway<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.450> getting<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
but I've tested anyway is getting the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.509 
but I've tested anyway is getting the
three<00:02:36.810> hits<00:02:37.110> from<00:02:37.440> whatever<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.129> are<00:02:38.280> using

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
three hits from whatever you are using

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.890 
three hits from whatever you are using
as<00:02:38.760> your<00:02:38.790> spirit<00:02:39.150> generates<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.660> then

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
as your spirit generates and then

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.360 
as your spirit generates and then
lashing<00:02:40.260> tail<00:02:40.440> keys<00:02:40.650> too<00:02:40.920> much<00:02:41.099> down<00:02:41.340> time

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
lashing tail keys too much down time

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.180 
lashing tail keys too much down time
when<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.910> could<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.180> lashing<00:02:42.510> tail<00:02:42.840> kick

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
when you could be lashing tail kick

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.800 
when you could be lashing tail kick
between<00:02:44.190> two<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.519> half<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.790> three<00:02:45.180> times<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
between two and a half of three times in

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.270 
between two and a half of three times in
that<00:02:46.290> amount<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.590> time<00:02:46.680> you're<00:02:46.860> using<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.220> get

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that amount of time you're using to get

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.979 
that amount of time you're using to get
the<00:02:47.370> extra<00:02:47.459> forty<00:02:47.760> percent<00:02:47.940> damage<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the extra forty percent damage so it

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.420 
the extra forty percent damage so it
really<00:02:49.200> comes<00:02:49.440> into<00:02:49.590> play<00:02:49.680> say<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.370> instance

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
really comes into play say for instance

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.640 
really comes into play say for instance
if<00:02:50.849> you're<00:02:51.000> you're<00:02:51.450> low<00:02:51.629> on<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:52.109> spirit<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
if you're you're low on on spirit and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
if you're you're low on on spirit and
you've<00:02:52.739> got<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.040> pitney<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:55.290> start

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you've got to pitney and you start

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.440 
you've got to pitney and you start
hitting<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.879> spirit<00:02:57.120> generators

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
hitting with your spirit generators

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
hitting with your spirit generators
again<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.660> lot<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.930> spirit<00:02:58.260> back<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.620> lashing

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
again a lot of spirit back and lashing

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.440 
again a lot of spirit back and lashing
tail<00:02:59.459> gate<00:02:59.670> or<00:02:59.790> even<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.060> you're<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.239> low<00:03:00.420> on

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
tail gate or even if you're just low on

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.759 
tail gate or even if you're just low on
spirit<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.989> don't<00:03:01.200> use<00:03:01.319> epiphany

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
spirit and you don't use epiphany

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.800 
spirit and you don't use epiphany
building<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.640> spirit<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.660> knock

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
building up that spirit and then knock

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.089 
building up that spirit and then knock
out<00:03:03.989> those<00:03:04.109> lashing<00:03:04.440> tail<00:03:04.560> kicks<00:03:04.829> they'll<00:03:04.950> do

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
out those lashing tail kicks they'll do

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.819 
out those lashing tail kicks they'll do
that<00:03:05.129> extra<00:03:05.579> little<00:03:05.700> bit<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.970> damage<00:03:06.120> as<00:03:06.359> well

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
that extra little bit of damage as well

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.650 
that extra little bit of damage as well
so<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:07.980> will<00:03:08.160> really<00:03:08.790> come<00:03:09.030> into<00:03:09.180> play<00:03:09.299> there

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
so that will really come into play there

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.900 
so that will really come into play there
the<00:03:10.650> only<00:03:10.829> other<00:03:11.040> thing<00:03:11.129> I<00:03:11.370> went<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.670> quickly

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the only other thing I went to quickly

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.750 
the only other thing I went to quickly
talk<00:03:12.060> about<00:03:12.299> was<00:03:12.450> unity<00:03:13.069> at<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.129> moment<00:03:14.430> unity

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
talk about was unity at the moment unity

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.430 
talk about was unity at the moment unity
doesn't<00:03:15.030> affect<00:03:15.359> matter<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.930> conviction

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
doesn't affect matter of conviction

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.920 
doesn't affect matter of conviction
because<00:03:16.709> technically<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.489> not<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:18.030> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
because technically it's not a it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.390 
because technically it's not a it
doesn't<00:03:19.230> provide<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> buffer<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.099> bit<00:03:20.250> d

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
doesn't provide a buffer you're a bit d

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.659 
doesn't provide a buffer you're a bit d
buffs<00:03:20.639> enemies<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.889> would<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.370> if

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
buffs enemies and so it would be if

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.400 
buffs enemies and so it would be if
you're<00:03:24.060> running<00:03:24.180> mantra<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.810> conviction

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
you're running mantra of conviction

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.539 
you're running mantra of conviction
unity<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.459> not<00:03:26.609> work<00:03:26.819> unity<00:03:27.780> also<00:03:28.549> doesn't

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
unity will not work unity also doesn't

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.099 
unity will not work unity also doesn't
cap<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:30.000> anywhere<00:03:30.359> so<00:03:30.540> if<00:03:30.630> you've<00:03:30.780> got<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
cap out anywhere so if you've got the

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.770 
cap out anywhere so if you've got the
three-piece<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.280> set<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
three-piece in a set or so the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.300 
three-piece in a set or so the
four-piece<00:03:34.109> intercept<00:03:34.560> which<00:03:34.680> allows<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.130> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
four-piece intercept which allows you to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.839 
four-piece intercept which allows you to
have<00:03:35.489> all<00:03:36.150> four<00:03:36.510> baseline<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.380> your<00:03:37.500> matters

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
have all four baseline of your matters

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.610 
have all four baseline of your matters
because<00:03:38.849> you'd<00:03:39.630> then<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.200> group<00:03:40.410> where

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
because you'd then be in a group where

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
because you'd then be in a group where
you'd<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:41.010> three<00:03:41.760> manors<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.419> manager

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
you'd have three manors because manager

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.479 
you'd have three manors because manager
of<00:03:42.810> conviction<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.290> involved<00:03:43.709> affecting

of conviction is involved affecting

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.699 
of conviction is involved affecting
three<00:03:45.000> people<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.959> would<00:03:46.139> technically<00:03:46.500> give

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
three people that would technically give

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.170 
three people that would technically give
you<00:03:46.799> forty-five<00:03:47.400> percent<00:03:47.519> increased<00:03:48.000> damage

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you forty-five percent increased damage

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.690 
you forty-five percent increased damage
I<00:03:48.510> believe<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.620> getting<00:03:49.829> fixed<00:03:50.040> possibly

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
I believe this is getting fixed possibly

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.819 
I believe this is getting fixed possibly
in<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.269> patch<00:03:51.510> tonight<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.440> downtime

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
in a patch tonight in the downtime

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.920 
in a patch tonight in the downtime
tonight<00:03:52.980> any<00:03:53.190> extended<00:03:53.489> maintenance<00:03:53.819> so<00:03:54.780> it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
tonight any extended maintenance so it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.659 
tonight any extended maintenance so it
caps<00:03:55.169> out<00:03:55.349> of<00:03:55.440> fifteen<00:03:55.769> percent<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
caps out of fifteen percent so that

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.009 
caps out of fifteen percent so that
technically<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.150> you're<00:03:57.239> running<00:03:57.329> one<00:03:57.599> mantra

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
technically if you're running one mantra

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.839 
technically if you're running one mantra
you<00:03:58.440> can<00:03:58.620> t<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.769> getting<00:03:58.950> fifteen<00:03:59.310> percent<00:03:59.609> and

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
you can t be getting fifteen percent and

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.970 
you can t be getting fifteen percent and
even<00:04:00.060> if<00:04:00.150> you're<00:04:00.269> running<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.629> inner<00:04:00.810> sir<00:04:01.139> for

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
even if you're running the inner sir for

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.379 
even if you're running the inner sir for
peace<00:04:02.190> your<00:04:02.430> own<00:04:02.579> beginning<00:04:02.910> fifteen<00:04:03.209> percent

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
peace your own beginning fifteen percent

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.479 
peace your own beginning fifteen percent

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
you tracking this so you don't get any

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.400 
you tracking this so you don't get any
sort<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.880> buff<00:04:48.120> come<00:04:48.360> up<00:04:48.510> if<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.780> use<00:04:49.080> your

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
sort of buff come up if you use your

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.930 
sort of buff come up if you use your
spirit<00:04:49.770> generator<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.370> then<00:04:50.520> get<00:04:50.640> a<00:04:50.700> little

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
spirit generator you then get a little

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.350 
spirit generator you then get a little
buff<00:04:51.090> come<00:04:51.300> up<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.570> say<00:04:52.580> mythic<00:04:53.580> rooms<00:04:53.820> active
