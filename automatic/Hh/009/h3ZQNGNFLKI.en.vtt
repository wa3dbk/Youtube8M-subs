00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello guys here is a new video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.720
 look at it in a day 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.320
 we start immediately with the breakfast I have 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.759
 made this banana and peach ice cream and then 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 enriched with other ingredients 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.010
 really great now that it has been 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 in short, it is always delicious to eat 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.240
 surely you have already seen it also in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 our other videos we simply have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.160
 frozen fruit just banana trees e 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.080
 fresh already chopped up 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.060
 we admit it on a sheet of paper 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.869
 oven so then as you see it comes off 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.090
 easily 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.760
 now let's go to blend with a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 blender to the inversion we put 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.530
 half peach and half banana and I add 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.640
 even some fresh peach so it helps 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 better blend also add a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 goccino of milk for the same reason 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.230
 and here is the result now I go to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.510
 flavor even more when muesli 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
 in the description find the recipe 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.030
 of our granola which is very good e 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 also very easy to prepare 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 I also add a little bit of drawings of who 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 others try to do things in smoke 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 do you think we take some 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 wild strawberry and some peach slices 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 look at how wonderful it is also 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 very good that advances but I did 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.460
 panzanella panzanella was to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.869
 that we have prepared for deborah milano 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.159
 very good and very tasty 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.619
 panzanella made in our version 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.350
 indeed we added that water 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.329
 we have soaked the bread in the pinecone 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.799
 greta with tomato is the recipe of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.320
 pantanella that of the greta vineyard 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.740
 tomato who is really delicious there 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.200
 always find in the description box 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.390
 let's cut out those who are in cubes this one 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 time but we peeled it since there 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 always ask why we peel iss e 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 three years old we left life 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.950
 so we commit everything we cut 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.950
 also our diced tomatoes 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.170
 we put it all together 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.840
 and we collect our basil which 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.210
 already begins to explain of basil ne 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.349
 we put enough because apart from that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.769
 there is very good but then from just one 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.239
 more gear to the panzanella so if 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.730
 you also like not to put one 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.459
 leaflet father go and add the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.739
 fundamental ingredient bread 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.440
 panzanella this is a beautiful bread 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.290
 made with sourdough indeed had 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.849
 really a slightly acid Rome 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.610
 very good wholemeal fine fair e 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's break the basil into it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.019
 directly with your hands 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.599
 then prepare the vinagrette for it 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.459
 oil our tomatoes if you don't have a 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.980
 very powerful blender started already 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.079
 chopped up we also put these two 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.260
 farms in gioli from the federica garden 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.150
 detoma cute vinegar the best one 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 of apples however the vinegar enough 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.940
 light, not that of a machete 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.940
 balsamic here so to speak in salt 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.760
 our basil, however, I repeat if 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.280
 found the recipe thousand of inscription ed 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.530
 here we are after having our own smoothie 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.720
 cellar is delicious but said yellow 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.280
 really if you haven't done it yet a 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.570
 this to flavor also 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.140
 simply the salad is really 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.120
 delicious and we follow just to 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.980
 wet bread this is a recipe that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.700
 as you can see you can in a handful of 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.520
 minutes and nutritious light and fresh and is 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.370
 also very good for snack we have 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.650
 had a simple kitchen felt I had 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.260
 a small packet of these almonds a 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.500
 strips and I simply have them 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.520
 serve with figs if you too 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.250
 like my kids 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.200
 it will be a delicious snack because then i 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.410
 figs are so good desserts that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.480
 they almost look like no sweets 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.550
 simple fruit and the crunchy of the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.250
 almonds goes very well with the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.490
 soft fig so it was delicious 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.500
 really even if very simple even 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.750
 we made the crunchy zucchini 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.810
 also find the recipe in this 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.239
 description we have slightly 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.940
 changed the recipe because we did 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.010
 a batter rather than just there 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.130
 do bear in chickpea flour and then 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.580
 we put together with the chickpea flour a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.890
 little bit of soy sauce to flavor 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.230
 a little bit of water and let's go 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.790
 simply to mix with one 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.330
 fork even better if you have one 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.669
 whisk aromatic herbs you can put 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.330
 also fresh herbs and stir 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.310
 all the batter is ready and not ready 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.669
 it remains at this point that you cut 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.860
 habit with strips 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.440
 if you have very large zucchini with 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.000
 many seeds inside as we have 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.040
 made us right in the video of the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.380
 recipe of crunchy courgettes 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.330
 you can remove some seeds and take 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.539
 especially the most ve part 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 the external one and now you mix it 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.710
 so we have to throw them all away 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.169
 however, the bowl is turned around 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.569
 to make the batter go on all the 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.830
 The sides of all the Turks do not remain there 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.750
 which practically bread zucchini a 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.080
 spoon into breadcrumbs and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.000
 then slowly stir them as you see 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.699
 silva stella you have your hands 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.289
 clean now add a little oil 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.719
 and meanwhile we have put our 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.150
 protect a baking sheet with a sheet underneath 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:31.969
 of parchment paper we end up with a little bit of 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.460
 salt and then bake with the batter 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.770
 that we have advanced we have prepared some 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.930
 then add a little meatballs 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.379

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.210

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.819

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.949
 Also here we put a bit of sauce 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.990
 Soy tea poor tea is almost finished too 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.180

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.919
 as with a nice fresh salad 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.319
 sorry for russia but then it started 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.889
 just to make darkness then put a 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.500
 lack of brightness and we do it 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.229
 very often you will have seen it very often 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.469
 in our videos of adding carotenes 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.610
 and radicchio seasoned with other thorium and a 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:33.650
 pinch of salt
