00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
front of a green screen and my job was

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.200 
front of a green screen and my job was
to<00:00:17.770> make<00:00:17.920> it<00:00:18.190> look<00:00:18.310> like<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:18.550> carebear<00:00:18.880> I<00:00:19.060> was

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
to make it look like a carebear I was

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.999 
to make it look like a carebear I was
jumping<00:00:19.420> up<00:00:19.630> from<00:00:19.690> behind<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.820> actor<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:23.009> and

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
jumping up from behind the actor and and

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.749 
jumping up from behind the actor and and
I<00:00:24.640> had<00:00:24.789> to<00:00:24.880> make<00:00:24.970> sure<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.240> my<00:00:25.539> 3d<00:00:26.759> character

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
I had to make sure that my 3d character

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.109 
I had to make sure that my 3d character
my<00:00:27.939> 3d<00:00:28.269> carebear<00:00:28.660> matched<00:00:29.320> with<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:30.369> live

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
my 3d carebear matched with the live

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.390 
my 3d carebear matched with the live
actor<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.960> one<00:00:32.470> way<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.650> was<00:00:32.830> able<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.160> go<00:00:33.250> about

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
actor and one way I was able to go about

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.100 
actor and one way I was able to go about
doing<00:00:33.580> that<00:00:33.760> was<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.150> take<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.600> green<00:00:34.810> screen

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
doing that was to take the green screen

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.470 
doing that was to take the green screen
footage<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.740> the<00:00:35.890> actor<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.430> place<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.329> in<00:00:37.450> the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
footage of the actor and place it in the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.880 
footage of the actor and place it in the
foreground<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.289> I<00:00:38.320> thought<00:00:38.469> we<00:00:38.590> could<00:00:38.710> take<00:00:38.829> a

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
foreground so I thought we could take a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.549 
foreground so I thought we could take a
look<00:00:39.190> at<00:00:39.370> doing<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.270> same<00:00:40.450> thing<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.350> in<00:00:41.469> the

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
look at doing the same thing so in the

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.610 
look at doing the same thing so in the
scene<00:00:41.739> I've<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.039> got<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.219> couple<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.750> couple<00:00:44.110> 3d

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the foreground now that means you're

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.719 
the foreground now that means you're
putting<00:01:20.229> an<00:01:20.320> image<00:01:20.560> on<00:01:20.770> top<00:01:20.979> of<00:01:21.610> everything

and<00:02:06.479> I'll<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.719> able<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.050> scrub<00:02:08.890> through<00:02:09.190> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and I'll be able to scrub through the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.570 
and I'll be able to scrub through the
frame<00:02:09.789> slider<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:11.260> we'll<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.010> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
frame slider and we'll see it in the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.340 
frame slider and we'll see it in the
compositing<00:02:13.480> time<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.110> gonna<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:14.320> ahead

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
compositing time so I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.270 
compositing time so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:14.470> close<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:15.300> head<00:02:16.300> over<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.780> control<00:02:17.230> f7

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and close this head over to control f7

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.430 
and close this head over to control f7
and<00:02:18.370> for<00:02:18.910> my<00:02:19.030> foreground<00:02:19.450> image<00:02:19.900> I'm<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
and for my foreground image I'm going to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.330 
and for my foreground image I'm going to
pick<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.340> green<00:02:21.580> screen<00:02:21.880> footage<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:23.680> I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
pick the green screen footage and as I

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.400 
pick the green screen footage and as I
scrub<00:02:24.670> through<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.540> see<00:02:25.780> we've<00:02:26.110> got<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
scrub through you can see we've got the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.360 
scrub through you can see we've got the
multiple<00:02:26.800> frames<00:02:27.510> okay<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.100> let's<00:02:30.100> go<00:02:30.250> ahead

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
multiple frames okay and let's go ahead

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.840 
multiple frames okay and let's go ahead
and<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> render<00:02:32.470> I've<00:02:32.620> got<00:02:32.890> well

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
and do a do a render I've got well

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.430 
and do a do a render I've got well
before<00:02:34.180> let's<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.660> see<00:02:34.930> what<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.170> looks<00:02:35.350> like

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
before let's just see what it looks like

before let's just see what it looks like
before<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.910> an<00:02:37.000> f<00:02:37.180> nine<00:02:40.590> okay<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.800> here<00:02:42.550> are

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
before so do an f nine okay and here are

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.930 
before so do an f nine okay and here are
coins<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.080> want<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.650> place<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.250> actor

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
coins and now I want to place the actor

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.590 
coins and now I want to place the actor
in<00:02:46.060> front<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.720> let<00:02:47.620> me<00:02:47.709> go<00:02:47.800> ahead<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
in front so let me go ahead and do a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160 
in front so let me go ahead and do a
render<00:02:49.950> f9<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:52.239> we<00:02:52.300> go<00:02:52.390> okay<00:02:52.690> well<00:02:52.900> where

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
render f9 there we go okay well where

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.290 
render f9 there we go okay well where
are<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.350> coins<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.769> can't<00:02:53.980> see<00:02:54.160> them<00:02:54.340> now<00:02:54.519> if<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
are the coins I can't see them now if I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.650 
are the coins I can't see them now if I
had<00:02:55.540> an<00:02:55.690> alpha<00:02:56.230> image<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.100> had<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> sequence

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
had an alpha image if I had a sequence

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.259 
had an alpha image if I had a sequence
of<00:02:58.810> images<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.410> were<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.980> Alpha<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.760> could

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
of images that were the Alpha I could

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.110 
of images that were the Alpha I could
use<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.769> foreground<00:03:02.769> alpha<00:03:03.280> option<00:03:03.940> and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
use the foreground alpha option and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.300 
use the foreground alpha option and
place<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.860> would<00:03:05.950> be<00:03:06.069> knocked

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
place it here and it would be knocked

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.759 
place it here and it would be knocked
out<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.940> have<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.239> sequence<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.650> go

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
out so if I have that sequence I can go

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
out so if I have that sequence I can go
ahead<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:08.950> throw<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.489> there<00:03:09.670> if<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.840> wanted

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
ahead and throw it in there if I wanted

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.500 
ahead and throw it in there if I wanted
to<00:03:11.200> we've<00:03:11.590> got<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.190> foreground<00:03:12.760> alpha

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
to we've got the the foreground alpha

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.410 
to we've got the the foreground alpha
sorry<00:03:14.080> foreground<00:03:14.650> fader<00:03:14.980> alpha<00:03:15.489> what<00:03:16.269> this

is really good for is say I loaded up a
black<00:03:19.390> image<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.130> could<00:03:21.540> with<00:03:22.540> an<00:03:22.750> envelope<00:03:23.079> I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
black image I could with an envelope I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.120 
black image I could with an envelope I
could<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.950> my<00:03:24.640> sequence<00:03:25.090> fade<00:03:25.870> fade<00:03:26.829> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
could have my sequence fade fade to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.750 
could have my sequence fade fade to
black<00:03:27.250> or<00:03:27.640> fade<00:03:28.030> up<00:03:28.299> from<00:03:28.930> black<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.579> do<00:03:30.579> that

black or fade up from black and do that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280 
black or fade up from black and do that
right<00:03:30.970> inside<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.450> lightwave<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.049> that's<00:03:32.170> a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
right inside of lightwave and that's a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
right inside of lightwave and that's a
good<00:03:32.560> use<00:03:32.799> for<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.220> foreground<00:03:33.640> fader<00:03:34.060> alpha

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
good use for the foreground fader alpha

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.509 
good use for the foreground fader alpha
is<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.170> plug<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.650> black<00:03:36.459> image<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.739> then

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
is to plug in black image and and then

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.600 
is to plug in black image and and then
just<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.540> dissolve<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.620> have<00:03:41.950> have

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
just have it dissolve in have have

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.220 
just have it dissolve in have have
either<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.950> footage<00:03:44.950> dissolve<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.549> or<00:03:46.230> you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
either the footage dissolve in or you

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.120 
either the footage dissolve in or you
know<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.180> know<00:03:49.299> fade<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.810> black<00:03:50.130> but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
know go to you know fade to black but

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.550 
know go to you know fade to black but
what<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.280> can<00:03:51.489> do<00:03:51.700> with<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.989> green<00:03:53.290> screen

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
what I can do with this green screen

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.410 
what I can do with this green screen
footage<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.820> do<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:54.970> don't<00:03:55.239> have<00:03:55.329> an

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
footage is I can do I don't have an

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.970 
footage is I can do I don't have an
alpha<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.650> shot<00:03:56.829> on

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
alpha for it it's just shot on

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.590 
alpha for it it's just shot on
green-screen<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:58.000> what<00:03:58.120> i<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.299> do<00:03:58.390> is<00:03:58.420> i<00:03:58.570> can

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
green-screen so what i can do is i can

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.199 
green-screen so what i can do is i can
go<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.410> foreground<00:03:59.920> key<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.730> i<00:04:00.970> can

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
go to the foreground key and I i can

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.640 
go to the foreground key and I i can
actually<00:04:01.359> key<00:04:01.810> out<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.739> color<00:04:03.489> range<00:04:03.820> now<00:04:04.650> it's

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
actually key out a color range now it's

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.759 
actually key out a color range now it's
not<00:04:05.859> going<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.570> it's<00:04:07.570> not<00:04:07.780> going<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.019> be<00:04:08.260> like

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
not going to it's not going to be like

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.620 
not going to it's not going to be like
working<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.370> digital<00:04:09.850> fusion<00:04:10.209> or<00:04:10.329> after

working in digital fusion or after

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.880 
working in digital fusion or after
effects<00:04:10.870> you're<00:04:11.049> not<00:04:11.140> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.320> have<00:04:11.440> as<00:04:11.620> much

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
effects you're not going to have as much

control but for lining stuff up this is
great<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.560> wouldn't<00:04:14.920> use<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.730> foreground

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
great so I wouldn't use the foreground

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.969 
of lightwaves but what I what I have
used<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:21.910> for<00:04:22.150> before<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.140> line<00:04:23.350> stuff<00:04:23.740> up

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
used it for before is to line stuff up

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.050 
used it for before is to line stuff up
and<00:04:24.280> be<00:04:24.400> able<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.669> do<00:04:25.919> previz<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.250> animatics

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
and be able to do previz and animatics

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.670 
and be able to do previz and animatics
to<00:04:28.240> make<00:04:28.360> sure<00:04:28.510> everything<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:28.900> going<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.140> look

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
to make sure everything is going to look

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.950 
to make sure everything is going to look
right<00:04:29.909> so<00:04:30.909> all<00:04:30.940> we<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.330> do

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
right so all we have to do

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.279 
right so all we have to do
is<00:04:32.669> pick<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:33.699> color<00:04:34.030> range<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.569> work<00:04:34.720> with<00:04:34.960> so

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
is pick a color range to work with so

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.340 
is pick a color range to work with so
I'm<00:04:35.770> going<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.009> go<00:04:36.160> ahead<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:36.819> just<00:04:37.780> left

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
I'm going to go ahead and just left

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.930 
I'm going to go ahead and just left
click<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.590> drag<00:04:38.979> on<00:04:39.280> my<00:04:40.120> RGB<00:04:40.780> values<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.500> and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
click and drag on my RGB values here and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.600 
click and drag on my RGB values here and
try<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.060> pick<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> color<00:04:43.990> range<00:04:44.319> that<00:04:44.979> i<00:04:45.370> think

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
try and pick a color range that i think

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.900 
try and pick a color range that i think
would<00:04:47.009> would<00:04:48.009> work<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.520> i'm<00:04:48.610> just<00:04:48.639> going<00:04:48.849> to

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
would would work so i'm just going to

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.839 
would would work so i'm just going to
kind<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.210> get<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.800> darker<00:04:50.800> green<00:04:51.009> here<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.789> i'll

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
kind of get a darker green here and i'll

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:59.210 
kind of get a darker green here and i'll
get<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.000> lighter<00:04:52.300> green<00:04:52.630> here<00:04:53.940> so<00:04:55.800> something

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220

this<00:05:02.800> range<00:05:03.130> let's<00:05:03.759> see<00:05:04.800> okay<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.250> lighter

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
this range let's see okay so lighter

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.990 
this range let's see okay so lighter
green<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.630> darker<00:05:07.990> green<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.789> let's<00:05:09.789> do<00:05:09.940> a

green and a darker green and let's do a
render<00:05:14.520> okay<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:15.759> now<00:05:16.270> I'm<00:05:16.449> keying<00:05:16.780> at<00:05:16.990> that

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
render okay so now I'm keying at that

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.170 
render okay so now I'm keying at that
out<00:05:17.320> that<00:05:17.530> color<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:18.009> can<00:05:18.160> see<00:05:18.370> where<00:05:18.610> the<00:05:18.789> actor

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
out that color I can see where the actor

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.550 
out that color I can see where the actor
is<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.910> see<00:05:22.630> if<00:05:22.810> I'm<00:05:22.990> lining<00:05:23.289> up<00:05:23.530> the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
compositing this in lightwave I'm just

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.749 
compositing this in lightwave I'm just
using<00:05:47.349> it<00:05:47.560> for<00:05:47.740> reference<00:05:47.889> but<00:05:48.250> this<00:05:48.430> is<00:05:48.580> close

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
using it for reference but this is close

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.060 
using it for reference but this is close
enough<00:05:48.820> if<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.360> needed<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.840> show<00:05:50.800> it<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.979> the

enough if I needed to show it to the

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.670 
enough if I needed to show it to the

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.820 
client and get sign-off it's close
enough<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:54.009> I<00:05:54.190> could<00:05:54.280> later<00:05:54.820> then<00:05:55.090> go<00:05:55.389> and

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
enough that I could later then go and

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.589 
enough that I could later then go and

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
take it into a compositing app just want

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.330 
take it into a compositing app just want
to<00:05:58.659> point<00:05:58.810> out<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.050> as<00:05:59.469> i<00:05:59.680> scrub<00:06:00.039> through<00:06:00.370> i

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
to point out that as i scrub through i

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.600 
to point out that as i scrub through i
don't<00:06:03.340> have<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.880> continue<00:06:04.870> to<00:06:05.020> key<00:06:05.320> i'll<00:06:05.610> it's

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
don't have to continue to key i'll it's

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.070 
don't have to continue to key i'll it's
already<00:06:06.880> going<00:06:07.000> to<00:06:07.090> its<00:06:07.419> using<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.900> same

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
already going to its using the same

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.950 
already going to its using the same
values<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:09.219> i<00:06:09.250> could<00:06:09.669> do<00:06:09.759> a<00:06:09.789> render<00:06:10.210> look<00:06:10.870> at

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
values so i could do a render look at

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.409 
values so i could do a render look at
this<00:06:11.020> guy<00:06:11.229> man<00:06:11.469> he's<00:06:12.130> going<00:06:12.430> places<00:06:12.639> so<00:06:13.270> if<00:06:14.169> I

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
this guy man he's going places so if I

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.659 
this guy man he's going places so if I
just<00:06:16.419> jump<00:06:16.509> to<00:06:16.750> another<00:06:16.840> frame<00:06:17.460> it's<00:06:18.460> going<00:06:18.610> to

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
just jump to another frame it's going to

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.860 
just jump to another frame it's going to
work<00:06:18.789> as<00:06:18.909> well<00:06:19.090> so<00:06:19.360> this<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.229> a<00:06:20.259> great<00:06:20.590> way<00:06:20.830> for

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
work as well so this is a great way for

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.290 
soft edges you are going to have hard
edges<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:46.280> you<00:06:46.370> again<00:06:46.730> you<00:06:46.880> wouldn't<00:06:47.120> want<00:06:47.240> to

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
edges so you again you wouldn't want to

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.850 
edges so you again you wouldn't want to
use<00:06:47.390> this<00:06:47.510> for<00:06:47.690> final<00:06:47.960> compositing<00:06:48.560> but<00:06:48.770> you

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
use this for final compositing but you

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.590 
use this for final compositing but you
could<00:06:49.100> use<00:06:49.130> it<00:06:49.460> to<00:06:49.640> help<00:06:49.760> kind<00:06:50.060> of<00:06:50.150> get<00:06:50.360> you

want it so that's just a quick look at

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.820 
want it so that's just a quick look at
using<00:07:02.090> foreground<00:07:02.960> images<00:07:03.410> in<00:07:03.650> the

using foreground images in the
compositing<00:07:04.400> time<00:07:04.610> and<00:07:05.650> remember<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:06.890> you

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
compositing time and remember that you

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.360 
compositing time and remember that you
can<00:07:07.130> also<00:07:07.310> just<00:07:07.640> load<00:07:07.820> in<00:07:07.970> a<00:07:08.030> black<00:07:08.330> image<00:07:08.840> and

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
can also just load in a black image and

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.250 
can also just load in a black image and
do<00:07:10.370> fade<00:07:10.760> in<00:07:10.880> and<00:07:10.970> fade<00:07:11.090> out<00:07:11.270> with<00:07:11.900> the
