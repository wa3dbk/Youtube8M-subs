00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
thing is is I feel like the TNA is

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.219

trying to get that casual fan and I
don't<00:04:18.709> necessarily<00:04:18.949> think<00:04:19.489> they're<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:20.000> by

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
don't necessarily think they're going by

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.659 
don't necessarily think they're going by
about<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> right<00:04:21.199> way<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.709> think<00:04:22.250> what<00:04:22.520> they

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
about it the right way I think what they

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.249 
about it the right way I think what they
should<00:04:22.880> do<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.060> something<00:04:23.600> similar<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.169> the

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
should do is something similar to the

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.310 
should do is something similar to the
UFC<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:25.370> treat<00:04:25.940> their<00:04:26.660> matches<00:04:27.139> with<00:04:27.289> that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
UFC in treat their matches with that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.050 
UFC in treat their matches with that
type<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.740> importance<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.789> type<00:04:29.030> of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
type of importance with that type of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.909 
type of importance with that type of
build<00:04:29.509> up<00:04:29.630> with<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.990> type<00:04:30.229> of<00:04:30.259> realism

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
build up with that type of realism

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.090 
build up with that type of realism
because<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.850> bottom<00:04:32.030> line<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.419> this<00:04:32.870> if<00:04:33.289> you

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.219 
because the bottom line is this if you
put<00:04:34.490> something<00:04:35.030> out<00:04:35.180> there<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.479> insults

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
goes on for four or five months and you

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.909 
goes on for four or five months and you
have<00:05:46.880> four<00:05:47.090> or<00:05:47.240> five<00:05:47.389> matches<00:05:47.840> each<00:05:48.020> match<00:05:48.500> has

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
have four or five matches each match has

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.189 
have four or five matches each match has
to<00:05:49.130> tell<00:05:49.340> different<00:05:49.789> story<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.449> each<00:05:50.900> match

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
to tell different story and each match

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.890 
to tell different story and each match
has<00:05:51.500> to<00:05:51.680> kind<00:05:51.860> of<00:05:52.009> talk<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.880> other<00:05:53.030> match<00:05:53.360> okay

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
has to kind of talk the other match okay

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.529 
has to kind of talk the other match okay
so<00:05:53.960> if<00:05:54.110> you<00:05:54.199> have<00:05:54.380> three<00:05:54.800> okay<00:05:55.699> matches<00:05:56.270> I

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
so if you have three okay matches I

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.029 
so if you have three okay matches I
think<00:05:57.020> that's<00:05:57.169> been<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.380> problem<00:05:57.650> with

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
think that's been the problem with

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.339 
think that's been the problem with
robbery<00:05:58.430> is<00:05:58.849> that<00:05:59.270> he<00:05:59.360> hasn't<00:05:59.659> had<00:05:59.810> not<00:06:00.199> that

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
robbery is that he hasn't had not that

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:01.600 
robbery is that he hasn't had not that
he's<00:06:00.470> not<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.650> good<00:06:00.830> wrestler<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.250> think<00:06:01.430> he's<00:06:01.550> a

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
he's not a good wrestler I think he's a

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.159 
he's not a good wrestler I think he's a
damn<00:06:01.940> good<00:06:01.970> wrestler<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:02.750> I<00:06:02.810> think<00:06:03.050> he's<00:06:03.139> a

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
damn good wrestler and I think he's a

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.080 
damn good wrestler and I think he's a
great<00:06:03.349> performer<00:06:03.949> but<00:06:04.310> he<00:06:04.400> has<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.699> have<00:06:04.880> those

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
great performer but he has to have those

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.360 
great performer but he has to have those
matches<00:06:05.509> that<00:06:05.539> solidify<00:06:06.380> his<00:06:06.530> career<00:06:06.979> I<00:06:07.190> don't

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
matches that solidify his career I don't

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.060 
matches that solidify his career I don't
think<00:06:07.550> he's<00:06:07.699> had<00:06:07.940> that<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:08.710> Bill<00:06:09.710> it's<00:06:09.860> good

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
think he's had that and Bill it's good

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.390 
think he's had that and Bill it's good
point<00:06:10.400> but<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.909> thing<00:06:11.120> there
