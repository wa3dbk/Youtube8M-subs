00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello youtube friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.319
 new lesson of this basic course of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.960
 chords today we're going to see the chord of the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 smaller and we're going to start combining it with 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 one of the chords of the lessons 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.680
 previous the names of the chords 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 they are very important eye the least 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.980
 learned well at the same time that you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 you learn the position learned well 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.609
 the names then in the second part of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 the lesson in the second video 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.460
 we will learn a couple of rhythms this time 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.830
 they will be easy rhythms but we will do them 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.870
 with the change of chords therefore 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 are easy rhythms so we can 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.500
 concentrate more in the other hand in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 next elections we will leave 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.090
 Complicating and good without further ado 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's move on to see how the chord is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.219
 well then to make this chord of the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.289
 lower what we're going to do is I'm going to 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.570
 explain as in the previous chords 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.309
 how to do it rope by rope then you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.570
 I will explain a little easier that is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.460
 the way I always go 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 teaching the chords to my students to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 that can remember them without major 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
 difficulty to start from above 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.489
 as always from the sixth string 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's leave the sixth string on the air and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.920
 the fifth string also to the air when 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 let's touch here the agreed completed the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.659
 sixth string we will try not to touch it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.049
 let's start giving the blow from the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.049
 fifth 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.450
 ok nothing happens if we miss our finger 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 and we play it will not sound bad but 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.939
 well let's start from the fifth 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.780
 because because the fifth string to the air 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.909
 is the note, that is, is the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.310
 tonic is what gives the name to 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.819
 I agreed it's okay then let's try 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.500
 that the first one we touch is the 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.299
 then we have said the sixth string to 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 air but let's try not to touch the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.689
 the fifth to the air and this yes we 're going 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.750
 to play now let's play the fourth and 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.990
 the third string on the number fret 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.619
 two 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.980
 with finger 2 and the three is to say 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.140
 we put together these 2 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.290
 and we put them, you know, covering the two 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.320
 cords is worth careful not to 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.810
 come up and play on the fifth string 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.460
 because then it's going to sound ugly it's worth and what 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 same down that they do not touch the rope of 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.070
 below that has to sound and this finger 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.790
 number one we are going to put on the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.620
 second fret rope number one 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 ok then so far we have 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.080
 sixth and fifth air fourth and third 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.740
 on the number two fret 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.350
 second string on the number one fret and 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.680
 we have the first string that we 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.050
 to leave the air we will not step on it 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.610
 same care with this finger that does not 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.720
 make very flat because if you put him 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.390
 very flat you are going to play the first string 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.550
 and it's going to sound bad the first string is worth 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.480
 you have to go under this finger 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.849
 without touching it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.659
 ok it has to sound to the air then the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.640
 full chord would sound like this 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.290
 as I tell you try not to touch the sixth 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.569
 rope try to hit from the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 fifth evidently when we are 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.030
 giving blows with the whole hand because it 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.640
 some blow is going to escape us and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's touch the sixth nothing happens not 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.470
 it's going to sound bad but good to try to play 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.510
 always from the fifth down 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.130
 because the fifth as we said is the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.080
 tonic note is the note to the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.570
 what we are going to do now is going to be 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.810
 combine this new chord that we have 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.820
 learned from the minor with the chord that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.460
 we saw in the previous election that it was my 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.150
 greater the chord of my major if you look 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.800
 it's exactly the same but all 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.800
 fingers a rope higher 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.710
 are worth the difference between the a between the 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.040
 the least that is this and my biggest that is 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.040
 this 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.280
 is to raise or lower a rope do not do 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.640
 mess with the names the one above was my 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.010
 greater and the bottom one even though it's the same is 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.629
 the lesser one is worth more, the other is less 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.010
 learned very well that do not get confused 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.440
 they are different 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.229
 top major minor bottom and exercise 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.880
 what are we going to do then it is simply 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.880
 that we put the minor 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:33.590
 we do not play it's worth it sounds good if any 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:37.970
 rope sounds bad we try to move it 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.580
 little we correct that we sound good 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.940
 do not sound the best we can and what 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.250
 let's do is change from the least to 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.890
 my oldest we raise all the fingers one 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.289
 rope up and in my biggest now 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:56.119
 if we play the sixth string worth 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.119
 the same we play one by one 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.830
 that sound good all that are more or 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.370
 unless there is no rope 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.930
 covered 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.030
 and we go back down to the lowest 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.570
 We try to play from the fifth worth 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.570
 without touching them 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 and again 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.610
 Y 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.340
 It is worth making this change many times 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.919
 makes this exercise many times 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.860
 principle will cost you okay, you will 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.500
 slowly and when changing it is normal that 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.150
 many strings sound bad the chords 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.540
 that has to be very difficult to 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.720
 touch 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.630
 it's very difficult to change chords fast 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.770
 and that sounds good what you have to do 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.770
 is to change the space 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.139
 trying to sound good always if not 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.879
 sounds good so what I tell you to correct 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.639
 and as I told you in the previous election 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.449
 you try to correct a little minute and you see 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.699
 that in a minute it still sounds bad 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.379
 continue, you continue to practice and 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.899
 we will try to correct the day 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:08.300
 following or whenever it is based on 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:10.939
 try a little each day you get 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.939
 if you try one day and it does not come out 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.069
 you stay there frustrated one hour 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.139
 trying to correct it in the end you're going to 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.569
 tired and you're going to leave therefore I 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.309
 I always say that you do not try either 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.469
 correct it until it sounds perfect 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:26.809
 because the chords are something that take 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.059
 weeks or even months to make them 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:33.009
 sound good then then a while 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:33.009
 every day you try to change my senior 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:41.330
 another is my biggest the least at the beginning 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.550
 do it very slowly when you have it 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.349
 practiced several days already you will see how 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.349
 although you do not want to leave faster 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.500
 these two chords sound very good together 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.820
 my oldest with the youngest we learn well 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.820
 this change because they sound very good 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.370
 good and the trick that I always tell them 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.440
 to my students to learn the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.840
 chords is to learn the ones in this very 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.540
 order that we are making them is to say 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.780
 we did first my minor that consisted 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.429
 nothing more in putting these two fingers then 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.860
 my biggest that was to add one 

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:23.560
 and then the smaller one is to download all the 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.930
 hand a rope 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.139
 that is, lower each finger one more rope 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.970
 down valecillos for example a minor 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:32.620
 with my older they do not combine very well but 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.860
 without your side if you learn it in this 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.860
 order 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.570
 Well, it's going to be quite easy for you 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.000
 memorize 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:47.500
 Well, we have learned the chord of 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.580
 the minor in the second video we will see a 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.660
 couple of basic rhythms to go 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.220
 combining and making this change of 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.810
 chord that we have done together with my 

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.810
 greater see you in the next video
