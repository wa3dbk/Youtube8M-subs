00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
stuff but for me I just I'm really

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.679 
stuff but for me I just I'm really
focused<00:01:45.430> on<00:01:45.549> okay<00:01:45.850> how<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.539> gonna

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
focused on okay how is this gonna

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.960 
focused on okay how is this gonna
contract<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.320> best<00:01:47.530> my<00:01:48.189> legs<00:01:48.399> were<00:01:48.580> ripped<00:01:48.789> at

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
contract the best my legs were ripped at

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.740 
contract the best my legs were ripped at
ten<00:01:49.149> weeks<00:01:49.530> from<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.649> front<00:01:50.920> side<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:52.600> me

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
ten weeks from the front side so for me

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.419 
ten weeks from the front side so for me
the<00:01:52.899> rep<00:01:53.110> range<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.679> can<00:01:53.860> be<00:01:54.039> very<00:01:54.220> high

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
the rep range that can be very high

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.120 
the rep range that can be very high
because<00:01:54.640> I'll<00:01:54.909> just<00:01:55.060> deplete<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.420> legs<00:01:55.750> down

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
because I'll just deplete my legs down

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.710 
because I'll just deplete my legs down
so<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.490> keep<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.759> weights<00:01:57.970> very<00:01:58.240> heavy

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
so I like to keep the weights very heavy

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.139 
so I like to keep the weights very heavy
and<00:01:59.049> do<00:01:59.289> lower<00:01:59.560> reps<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.070> obviously<00:02:00.369> what

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
and do lower reps and obviously what

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.359 
and do lower reps and obviously what
happens<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.659> when<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.990> train<00:02:02.860> with<00:02:03.069> as<00:02:03.190> much

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
happens is when you train with as much

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.639 
happens is when you train with as much
volume<00:02:03.549> as<00:02:03.880> me<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.810> can't<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.319> as<00:02:05.440> many

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
volume as me you can't do as many

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.139 
volume as me you can't do as many
repetitions<00:02:05.860> because<00:02:06.670> you'll<00:02:06.789> just<00:02:06.970> burn

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
repetitions because you'll just burn

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.270 
repetitions because you'll just burn
yourself<00:02:07.600> up<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.990> mean<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.590> have<00:02:08.739> one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
yourself up I mean you have to have one

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.440 
yourself up I mean you have to have one
of<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.459> other<00:02:09.519> either<00:02:09.759> you're<00:02:09.940> gonna<00:02:10.030> do<00:02:10.209> less

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
of the other either you're gonna do less

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.620 
of the other either you're gonna do less
weight<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:12.069> know<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:12.670> repetitions<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
weight you know more repetitions and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.229 
weight you know more repetitions and
less<00:02:13.930> sets<00:02:14.440> or<00:02:15.190> you're<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.519> do<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:16.000> lot

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
less sets or you're going to do a lot

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.680 
less sets or you're going to do a lot
more<00:02:16.269> sets<00:02:16.660> heavier<00:02:17.049> weights<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.650> less<00:02:18.069> reps

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690 

I<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> very<00:02:24.740> good<00:02:24.950> system<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.460> way<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
I have a very good system the way it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.630 
I have a very good system the way it
works<00:02:25.880> now<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.510> trained<00:02:27.410> by<00:02:27.530> myself<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.190> you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
what will you do is we try to film the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.830 
what will you do is we try to film the
training<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.460> film<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> sets<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
training and we film the sets in the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.630 
training and we film the sets in the
reps<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.260> what<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.380> do<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.830> go<00:02:40.160> back<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.610> I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
reps and what I do is I go back and I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.600 
reps and what I do is I go back and I
almost<00:02:40.910> watch<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.780> game<00:02:42.200> tape<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.460> say

and as you notice I had him watch my

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.430 
and as you notice I had him watch my
form<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:47.120> little<00:02:47.330> bit<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.990> say<00:02:48.170> okay<00:02:48.350> I'm

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
gonna take this one down to here

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.240 
gonna take this one down to here
most<00:02:50.750> importantly<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.410> legs<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.830> depth

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
most importantly on legs is the depth

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.220 
most importantly on legs is the depth
that<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.550> go<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.210> speed<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.780> travel

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
that I go in the speed that I travel

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.050 
that I go in the speed that I travel
through<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.440> repetitions<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.880> want

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
through the repetitions because I want

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.810 
through the repetitions because I want
to<00:02:56.150> fire<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.510> quad<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.460> have<00:02:58.460> someone<00:02:58.760> there
