00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.450
 but a very ambiguous UAH 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.020
 You can immediately say that in all fans 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.410
 it is of course necessary to buy 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.879
 but not all normal people 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.400
 I think it's still worth it 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.480
 wanted to see found a review since 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.750
 different incomes in the blood of children and the main 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 of them probably this is the graphics of the game 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.630
 highly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.300
 on this the fact that the miner gave them anri lunch 3 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.439
 more 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.470
 I'm probably not the one who claims 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.020
 baths which here is not very beautiful not 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.690
 very high on regional 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.840
 there are ratings 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.740
 the tubes lie here these here she also became 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.580
 very high in regional but with 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.050
 this 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.950
 everything looks more or less good 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.460
 the main thing 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.149
 n claims to him fathers not only that 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.750
 all character models made 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 also not very highly regional no no 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 the most important thing is that they are all very 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.400
 mediocre animated that is 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.080
 when your character tries 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.940
 talk to do some 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 hand gestures it all looks very 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.150
 puppet when triggered what 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.820
 something trap and our characters are killing it 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 looks like a doll 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.050
 and this is probably the biggest drawback 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.350
 because 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.770
 o if you remember the film itself there each 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.430
 deadly forged and his 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 the birthplace 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.850
 so areas we managed here we are 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 see what is incomprehensible vague 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.649
 and all these traps want 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.909
 reach never fall from one not 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.049
 that now there will be some sense of the edge 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.139
 heartbreaking action on screen 

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.479
 because it will be terrible wretchedness and not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.170
 I do not want to look at the second claim Pele 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.570
 this is already part of the general plan in general 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.240
 the game is divided into two parts by decision 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 puzzles and research 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.659
 areas and vice versa 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.109
 fighting scenes made 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.179
 so disgusting that after the first of them 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.109
 and you want to throw the joystick there did not know 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.349
 keyboard if you play on computer 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.979
 sources they include 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.799
 because the combat system is just 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.529
 terrifying I don't know how workflows 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.139
 could do that is initially saw very 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.489
 reminds with antjuh om kamenka then as soon as 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.109
 comes to st first battlefield right away 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.649
 do you understand how strong your strength was 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.209
 cool game because there were parts 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.569
 It was above all praise 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.790
 because there was something generally possible 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.170
 do different blows of fate beautiful cars 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.389
 million here our hero can 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.219
 use different types of weapons 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.799
 cold you can tell tape 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.969
 have a can without a fight bat try to give 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.609
 on the head or point of the regiment that will find 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.759
 but at the same time 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.809
 the case is always one was killed 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.659
 when you must immediately kill 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.699
 rival but the most important thing is that rivals 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.279
 our here these here that incomprehensible psyche 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.719
 quarrel subject to traps on their heads 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.459
 they can just run and start 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.429
 do yourself 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.849
 m one banana punch you nothing 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.959
 can do it because if the hall 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.759
 there was a wall and you had nowhere to retreat 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.929
 and win and the reasons for the high complexity then 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.789
 it will be created going down and you 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.679
 will just look like u 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.040
 your characters 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.160
 dispersed the guide his number 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.820
 call the police and try electric in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.500
 Russia is a place shorter all this is very 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.849
 stupid very incomprehensible 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.840
 and why is all this done? 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.099
 attitude to the tribe fights but if 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.430
 look at the game of another country very 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.760
 not bad even if uefa is on film 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.859
 It may even be good but because 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.700
 the plot was made by the writers that we 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 wrote the very first pilot to play back 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.329
 David Tapan is a detective who 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 actually died on the first part but 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.009
 for yourself is always interesting plot from 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.489
 bullets with another alas but im 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.659
 In general, they have treated the house more 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.859
 dead and there is even very much alive and 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.859
 and the designer joked a little bit like that 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:46.599
 and 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.019
 and how the ordinary field came out but demanded 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.969
 disable enable it 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.729
 many characters to you kiyev and 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.959
 with a huge white squirrel 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.530
 which this time finds its abandoning 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.889
 hospital suit file 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.309
 and the crisis of our chest 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.819
 the main character for many 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:04.759
 savior 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.679
 and the third is generally explained why 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.969
 many 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.790
 suppressing the city attacking the price of our 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.099
 main character 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.299
 it's all we have to fight back from them but 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.579
 such a silly pretty explanation never mind 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.159
 so here is the main part 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.880
 time we will have to learn this very 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.410
 hospital and solve puzzle chapters 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.319
 beautiful 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.029
 very many of them 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.819
 unusual interesting 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.259
 but it is still possible 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.180
 there are puzzles from the category but twist and 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.629
 many gizmos 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.300
 and when the mission is combined with some kind of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.190
 to a logical chain then something will open 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.529
 and it happens 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.310
 chapters 17 shrewdness for example we are in one of 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.480
 test for us take includes 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.110
 timer 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.569
 but this is so minute 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.710
 open the box correctly or 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.569
 everything will explode 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.690
 slice you understand why 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.420
 Russia 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.600
 the hero of the film is the gentlemen of such a situation 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.170
 starts to panic and doesn't mean to do with 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.770
 this herring stupidity everyone dies 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.450
 because it's true when you are only two 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.270
 minutes to decide what is logical 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.250
 tasks 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.160
 and you still do not understand what 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.460
 logic and three tasks for example you will find yourself 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.139
 in the morgue 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.509
 on the door of their chamber dream various 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.800
 items and you have to open correctly 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.839
 and it really gives a hint 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.789
 and runs out in this room don't understand 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.759
 what do you want a percentage of and if 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.679
 calm down and look to 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.089
 the terrain is bad in the dark part 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:30.770
 premises 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.770
 the wall is painted on in light of another mission 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.580
 paints 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.319
 something 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.349
 if you come to the right angle and 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.389
 look from afar then suddenly visible 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.700
 outlines of a pistol 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.690
 and just one of the items 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.840
 painted on cameras is a gun 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.020
 unlockable loudly resolved all very 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.770
 simple and logical just need 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.509
 calm down and think 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.449
 and in general, such district 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.360
 interesting puzzles 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.659
 lots of 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.229
 and by this she bribes because 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.620
 the atmosphere itself saws very healthy 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.599
 saved 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:04.950
 it is estimated that all of our 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.800
 woke up 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.839
 in the toilet 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.540
 savenkov columns 2 m 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.320
 we shoot begin logical puzzles we 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.300
 decide we go further 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.479
 n randomly what characters and 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.389
 for example in the first character of which 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.300
 we save 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.789
 is amanda ankh 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.389
 by the addict who is like 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.379
 it turned out then became assistant leads 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.430
 here is behind this plot 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.589
 Red subject characters we meet 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.919
 interesting to watch follow to the very 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.579
 the end of the game all this prevents only 

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:36.559
 incomprehensible clashes with enemies who 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.479
 just enrages the joke and in the end starts 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.719
 annoying equally repetitive they don't 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.009
 puzzles like opening locks 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.789
 always the same 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.210
 outages in 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.009
 always the same 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.069
 read here the thing that is constantly 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:53.939
 repeats constantly the same way 

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.169
 they are the brain after the middle of the day 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.649
 starts to lag behind 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:00.919
 mad at monotony but when 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.099
 this is all the same again if you 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.509
 movie fans 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:05.349
 tons 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.840
 look at the local two ending 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.800
 look at the lot department look at 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.009
 familiar characters and test your 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.650
 guess tee erudition in general 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.000
 solve local puzzles and 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.080
 especially when he gives limited 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.599
 time this is great this is interesting 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:25.449
 and it's all in the spirit of pylori 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.510
 2 the atmosphere of the film 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.160
 publicly great it is supported and for 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.670
 this developers need to put 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.450
 great advantage
