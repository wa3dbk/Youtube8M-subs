00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's good we're getting practice dealing

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.410 
it's good we're getting practice dealing
with<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.560> rocky<00:02:15.830> steep<00:02:16.400> shoreline<00:02:16.970> because

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
with the rocky steep shoreline because

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.850 
with the rocky steep shoreline because
we'll<00:02:17.660> probably<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> lot<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.770> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
we'll probably see a lot of that on the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.520 
we'll probably see a lot of that on the
inside<00:02:18.980> passage<00:02:19.690> if<00:02:20.690> that's<00:02:21.020> what<00:02:21.200> happens

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
inside passage if that's what happens

inside passage if that's what happens
next<00:02:21.860> summer<00:02:23.260> probably<00:02:24.260> won't<00:02:24.380> see<00:02:24.560> too<00:02:24.590> much

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
