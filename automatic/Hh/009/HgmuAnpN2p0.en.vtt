capital<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.209> world<00:02:40.769> but<00:02:41.769> once<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.489> think<00:02:42.549> we

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
capital of the world but once I think we

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.420 
capital of the world but once I think we
get<00:02:43.480> beyond<00:02:43.810> our<00:02:44.140> mutual<00:02:44.650> love<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.890> horses

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
get beyond our mutual love of horses

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.210 
get beyond our mutual love of horses
then<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:45.760> find<00:02:46.030> other<00:02:46.390> ways<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.920> mutual

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
then we find other ways to have mutual

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.309 
then we find other ways to have mutual
interests<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.780> Kentuckians

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319
