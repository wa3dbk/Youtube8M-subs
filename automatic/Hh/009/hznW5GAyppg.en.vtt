00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:47.280 
back that point then you're ready to
just<00:02:37.290> pop<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.860> control<00:02:38.280> arm<00:02:38.460> out<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.790> there

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.350 

right<00:02:48.290> here's<00:02:48.560> where<00:02:48.650> those<00:02:48.980> spacers<00:02:49.490> go<00:02:49.790> if

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
right here's where those spacers go if

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.670 
right here's where those spacers go if
you're<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.660> thinking<00:02:51.020> about<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.260> when<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.560> go

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
you're not thinking about it when you go

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.230 
you're not thinking about it when you go
pulling<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.160> control<00:02:52.610> arm<00:02:52.790> off<00:02:52.970> those

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
pulling this control arm off those

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.240 
pulling this control arm off those
spacers<00:02:53.660> will<00:02:53.840> fly<00:02:54.080> around<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.590> flop<00:02:54.800> off<00:02:55.040> and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
spacers will fly around and flop off and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.770 
spacers will fly around and flop off and
you<00:02:55.310> won't<00:02:55.490> know<00:02:55.640> how<00:02:55.819> many<00:02:56.000> were<00:02:56.180> at<00:02:56.300> each<00:02:56.510> one

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
you won't know how many were at each one

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.809 
you won't know how many were at each one
this<00:02:57.470> one<00:02:57.709> had<00:02:57.860> two<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.160> front<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.610> front

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
this one had two in front of the front

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.460 
this one had two in front of the front
and<00:02:59.090> four<00:02:59.569> in<00:02:59.690> from<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.020> back

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
and four in from the back

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.560 
and four in from the back
so<00:03:00.770> put<00:03:00.950> them<00:03:01.069> back<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.550> same<00:03:01.790> sequence

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
so put them back in the same sequence

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.449 
so put them back in the same sequence
that<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.959> took<00:03:03.110> them<00:03:03.260> out<00:03:03.380> on<00:03:03.830> this<00:03:04.070> control

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
that you took them out on this control

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.620 
that you took them out on this control
arm<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.850> can<00:03:05.000> see<00:03:05.209> why<00:03:05.390> we're<00:03:05.600> changing

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
arm you can see why we're changing

now a word about these control arms you

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.750 
now a word about these control arms you
can<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.610> them<00:03:13.790> mixed<00:03:14.120> up

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
can get them mixed up

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.250 
can get them mixed up
the<00:03:16.760> right<00:03:17.030> can<00:03:17.330> fit<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.750> left<00:03:17.959> they<00:03:18.140> will

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
the right can fit on the left they will

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.870 
the right can fit on the left they will
actually<00:03:18.620> bolt<00:03:18.860> up<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.310> won't<00:03:19.520> know<00:03:19.640> anything

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
actually bolt up you won't know anything

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.430 
actually bolt up you won't know anything
till<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.300> go<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.450> drive<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:20.989> thing<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.380> it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
till you go to drive this thing and it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.340 
till you go to drive this thing and it
won't<00:03:21.620> steer<00:03:21.950> right<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.750> difference<00:03:24.140> is

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
won't steer right but the difference is

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.560 
won't steer right but the difference is
on<00:03:25.010> these<00:03:25.250> control<00:03:25.489> arms<00:03:25.670> you'll<00:03:26.060> see<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
on these control arms you'll see on the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.530 
on these control arms you'll see on the
backside<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.320> kind<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.650> curved<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:29.390> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
backside it's kind of curved and on the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.800 
backside it's kind of curved and on the
front<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:30.050> straight<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.209> straight<00:03:32.510> side

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
front it's straight so the straight side

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.530 
front it's straight so the straight side
goes<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.380> front<00:03:33.590> if<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.820> reverse<00:03:35.180> these

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
goes to the front if you reverse these

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.600 
goes to the front if you reverse these
they<00:03:36.170> look<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.680> said<00:03:36.860> they<00:03:37.010> will<00:03:37.220> bolt<00:03:37.430> up

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
they look like I said they will bolt up

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.570 
they look like I said they will bolt up
but<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:37.940> will<00:03:38.090> still<00:03:38.360> steer<00:03:38.870> crazy<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:40.310> again

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
but it will still steer crazy so again

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.009 
but it will still steer crazy so again
the<00:03:40.790> front<00:03:41.090> side<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.050> straight<00:03:42.350> side

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
the front side is the straight side

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.610 
the front side is the straight side
these<00:03:45.019> control<00:03:45.470> arms<00:03:45.910> do<00:03:46.910> not<00:03:47.060> come<00:03:47.360> with<00:03:47.540> a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
these control arms do not come with a

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.220 
these control arms do not come with a
rubber<00:03:48.620> bumper<00:03:48.920> already<00:03:49.519> installed<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:51.200> you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
rubber bumper already installed so you

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.620

need to install one usually if you

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.720 
need to install one usually if you
squirt<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.079> down<00:03:54.230> with<00:03:54.410> some<00:03:54.440> type<00:03:54.799> of<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:55.130> Lube

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
squirt it down with some type of a Lube

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.570 
squirt it down with some type of a Lube
first

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.220 

using<00:04:02.030> channel<00:04:02.390> locks<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:02.810> pull<00:04:02.960> it<00:04:03.110> up

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
using channel locks and pull it up

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.020

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
time trying to get this thing installed

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.830 
time trying to get this thing installed
again<00:04:26.480> put<00:04:27.170> it<00:04:27.290> in<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.500> vise<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.330> just<00:04:29.330> loosen

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
again put it in a vise and just loosen

those outer bolts nuts

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.930 
those outer bolts nuts
don't<00:04:34.430> take<00:04:34.580> them<00:04:34.730> completely<00:04:34.850> off

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.340 

that<00:04:39.940> way<00:04:40.090> when<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.390> go<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.570> install<00:04:40.750> this

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
that way when you go to install this

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.430 
that way when you go to install this
it'll<00:04:42.160> go<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.460> position<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.540> then<00:04:44.170> it<00:04:44.290> should

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
it'll go in position and then it should

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.430 
it'll go in position and then it should
rock<00:04:44.710> up<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.370> down<00:04:45.520> free<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.480> makes<00:04:47.290> it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
rock up and down free like that makes it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.820 
rock up and down free like that makes it
much<00:04:47.680> easier<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:48.130> install<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:52.680> take<00:04:53.680> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
much easier to install it take the

two studs are up there that will mount
to

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.510 

we<00:05:07.200> have<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.530> jock<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:07.980> around<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.280> little<00:05:08.340> bit

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
we have to jock it around a little bit

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.060 
we have to jock it around a little bit
to<00:05:08.700> get<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.970> in<00:05:09.090> place<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.740> then<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.860> need<00:05:11.040> to

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
to get it in place and then you need to

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.960 
to get it in place and then you need to
take<00:05:11.310> your<00:05:11.550> spacers<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.810> put<00:05:13.440> them<00:05:13.530> back

there's another thing you'll save you a
little<00:05:16.050> bit<00:05:16.290> of<00:05:16.410> time<00:05:16.620> sometimes<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.760> spacers

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
little bit of time sometimes in spacers

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.140 
little bit of time sometimes in spacers
we'll<00:05:18.480> all<00:05:18.630> just<00:05:18.840> be<00:05:18.930> they'll<00:05:19.320> fall<00:05:19.560> apart<00:05:19.889> and

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
we'll all just be they'll fall apart and

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.220 
we'll all just be they'll fall apart and
fall<00:05:21.150> out<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.389> there<00:05:21.630> when<00:05:21.810> you're<00:05:21.930> trying<00:05:22.080> to

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
put them together you take just a little

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.500 
put them together you take just a little
grease<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:26.370> layer<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.760> grease<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.180> between
