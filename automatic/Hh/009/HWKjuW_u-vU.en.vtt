00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it bare metal but that's not going to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
it bare metal but that's not going to
work<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> country<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.939> Holland<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:04.140> way

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
work in a country like Holland it's way
too<00:02:04.439> wet<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.250> country<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.420> going

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
too wet in this country so that's going

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.830 
too wet in this country so that's going
to<00:02:06.689> rust<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.649> looking<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:09.060> I've<00:02:09.450> taken
