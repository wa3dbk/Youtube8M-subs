00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.740

 A good clutch is a pair of gloves 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.680
 I'm also using a kind of protection 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.390
 to avoid emis icons 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390

 used cars to the meter cycle we recover 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.930

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.479

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.519

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.629
 to hell with the markings 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.510
 and we have always insisted on the same point we were on 37 38 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.579
 meters 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.699
 we have also continued to call them seen even after the 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 something that is not fish though 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.199
 already half-eaten water was the pouvoir garden to the limit of the equipment 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.519
 the key is a very tight clutch 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.249
 and we say that we have not put in crisis - 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.829

 vertical jigging app really a technique 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
 I have to give unique emotions 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.640
 and the nice thing is that you can do it from any kind of 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.249
 boat from a rubber boat 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.839

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.709
 any brand low action to see the markings well in the scalar pool and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.929
 obviously have a little luck in meeting 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 beautiful views fish 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.059

 this thing already rewarded 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.149
 as can be seen from the blood traces 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.289
 we passed the bike to caliber 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.329

 some same things there chronicle 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.999
 and therefore 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.519
