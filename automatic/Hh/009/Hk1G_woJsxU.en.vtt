 Hi Economy Todie Announcer Kim Hyun-jin 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.840
 Honda's mid - sized suv pound Honda cr-v is a UK consumer magazine 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.710
 It was selected as the most reliable sub in the August issue. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.570
 Having received such a good reputation and gaining infinite trust in consumers 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.159
 Honda sub cr v 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.359
 What the hell is it because today is attractive for non-Honda sub cr 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:29.220
 Let me see. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.810
 Honda Korea Korea Product Planning Team 2 Housing Director 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.160
 I'll talk to you. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.440
 Hello. Hello. Nice to meet you. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 I saw four Honda sub cfs on my way to work this morning. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 The first impression is that the design is so neat and simple. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.109
 I heard. 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.039
 In fact, design is one of the most amazing elements to buy 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.469
 can 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:00.269
 Overall design feature 1 fuzzy visibility city center medium suv Honda cr-v 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.980
 Is a sophisticated and sporty airline arm at the top, 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:09.540
 While looking at the design, the black bumper and the road shield, etc. 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.990
 We pursue a dynamic and sporty design utilizing the outdoor style 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.050
 There is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 I've only looked at four artisans four. 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.410
 When I look at the external space, it is actually a bit wider for a medium suv. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.400
 It receives a lot of evaluation 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.820
 How can I utilize the internal space? Yes. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.650
 Indeed the indoor space is much more 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.510
 If the same is true for the basic trunk loading space 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.380
 And if you catch an ear, increase the loading space by 2008 l. 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.020
 can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.850
 However, many errors breasts out even as supplies of goods within or what other kids 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.440
 You can get enough of the same amount 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.500
 4 2 1 c As you can see from the frame, 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.520
 I think you're such a Soccer Mom why she diameters in the US 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.270
 I think it is very convenient when the children carry it like this. 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.610
 I have also looked at the design and the mounting holes, 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 I wonder how much stronger in the heart Eyes engine performance Help yourself again point out 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.420
 For example, the top three cars of cr-v are 2.4l . 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.590
 The title of the engine is directly underwater and the SUV is required 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.840
 Sufficient for part 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:27.930
 And can exhibit a stable acceleration driving performance and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.950
 Unlike the diesel engine due to the nature of the gasoline engine, 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.210
 You will be able to 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 Yes I really want to exert some force is expected that once after seeing other 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.350
 I'll take a good look. 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.700
 Hasyeotdeutyi said before, just because the secondary galttae petrol 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.510
 Yes. Actually, it seems like there is a little obstacle in terms of fuel economy. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.580
 The fuel cost is 10.4, but it is actually 9.2 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.210
 He said 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.960
 Or how to live a little bit more to increase the fuel efficiency improvements that can increase this 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.910
 Way 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:03.700
 Please let me know this sweat hanoi cut mode can improve fuel economy 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.470
 There are all part of the air conditioning system controlled by tomorrow or the output of the engine 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.670
 More than anything, you can improve the fuel economy in the spring as part of the technology 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.740
 We are equipped with 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.720
 Actually, sneakers and Shabu users see them and they are good at acting 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 This is a state of affairs 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:25.530
 4 Design and Engine Performance Characterized by Salt Shine 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.530
 I 'll try to give you more details after you get there. 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.660
 4 I ran the Honda cr-v myself 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:56.220
 I think this is not really suitable for female drivers. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:01.110
 Fact, I even heard that feeling overall is smooth and easy it self well 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.380
 Go ahead and proceed fairly smoothly . 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.520
 People were comfortable when they got on and off again. 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.930
 Yes I think one would need to look at again in my part of the internal system convenience features 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.790
 Keeper's market 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.299
 If you look at the inside of the civ, it is all-in-one navigation 2 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:23.490
 AudioA navigation is an integrated touch-screen 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:28.380
 The more time you travel then we go in the way itguyo 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.080
 To be able to drive sporty, paddle shift and s 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 It is now applicable in that mode 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.230
 Sportier than ever when you are driving on your eve 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.790
 You can make sporty driving and load of swords and leads mentioned above 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.310
 A worm motion that can be folded in a single operation with a white spot 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.790
 It is applied to the folding rear seat, etc. 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.880
 It seems that there are really various convenience devices 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.979
 And another thing. It's pretty quiet . 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.130
 4 Quietness is excellent. I thought this was because of gasoline. 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.300
 Maybe it fits the characteristics of the lens 4 Gasol 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.520
 The noise of the engine is small, and then the noise coming from the road 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.750
 There is a lot of blockage through the sound effects applied to the lower part of the body. 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.470
 And I write in aerodynamic design Toka what wind this part 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.300
 We've cut down a lot 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:26.400
 I think it's because of all the different reasons . 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.110
 The yard is a good way to go smoothly, 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.190
 I feel like I left it. 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.030
 Above all, it doldeon well be true agility when cornering see any particular reason 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.130
 I wonder if 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.169
 Example If you have a 4-wheel drive model today, you can use an electronically controlled real-time 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.450
 Four-wheel drive system is applied 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:49.440
 This section is usually used to operate the next drive, 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.520
 If there is a gap, the driving force is immediately distributed to the four-wheel drive 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.039
 System 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:02.580
 And vsl to control the body posture and adaptive that motion strikes 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:08.099
 Steering is applied to make it easy for the driver and the cornering to grasp 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:10.710
 What is the philosophy at the driving situation or underestimate the hill leading to the various import 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:15.510
 It is applied to make it perfect. 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:19.919
 Okay, the last Honda sub civ actually has a car. 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:22.800
 I'm over the world 500 4 sold under for residents only so much bouncing 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.849
 Why you sold or what you want to say about this car 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.430
 If there are 4 lecture notes, please tell me. 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:32.030
 It is a buzzword. 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.960
 Yeah, so I tendeyo diesel with a lot of lines suv 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:41.870
 In our case, the cr-v is a gasoline engine, 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.880
 Whether the company is showing excellent efficiency and then the second or the second 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.290
 Safety is now considered 4 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:53.120
 In the recent safety assessment conducted in the ASEAN region , 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.620
 Thus obtained to catch two rabbits in n fuel economy and safety 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.180
 It can be called a model 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:03.740
 4 I have met with safety today 4 Honda sb October rain today 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:08.630
 I can ride the 2nd stage with my family so that I can enjoy the space flow without any problem. 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:10.040
 It's a car that can ride along with acceleration. 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.570
 I thought. 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.990
