course<00:02:16.190> let's<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.310> who<00:02:17.430> else<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:17.849> here

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
course let's see who else is down here

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
course let's see who else is down here
787<00:02:18.930> Uka<00:02:19.260> Uka<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:20.069> they<00:02:20.190> started

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
787 Uka Uka is down here they started

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.540 
787 Uka Uka is down here they started
about<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.940> third<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.480> from<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> pin<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
about a third up from the pin and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.830 
about a third up from the pin and
quantum<00:02:23.550> racing<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.300> windward<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.659> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
quantum racing just to windward of that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.149 
quantum racing just to windward of that
so<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.220> big<00:02:26.250> guns<00:02:26.700> are<00:02:26.879> certainly<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.629> and

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
so the big guns are certainly here and

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.350 
so the big guns are certainly here and
and<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.760> know<00:02:29.819> we're<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.030> watching

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and you know we're just watching

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.350 
and you know we're just watching
simplicity<00:02:31.170> tak<00:02:31.940> let's<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.180> they're

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
simplicity tak let's see if they're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.930 
simplicity tak let's see if they're
going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.569> cross<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:35.190> looked<00:02:35.400> pretty<00:02:35.489> strong

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
going to cross it looked pretty strong

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.199 
going to cross it looked pretty strong
right<00:02:36.209> now

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
right now

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.420 
right now
simplicity<00:02:39.209> looking<00:02:39.629> very<00:02:39.900> strong<00:02:43.280> they<00:02:44.280> are

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
simplicity looking very strong they are

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
simplicity looking very strong they are
cross<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:46.140> simplicity<00:02:46.739> crosses<00:02:47.129> ook<00:02:47.280> ook

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
cross the simplicity crosses ook ook

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.740 
cross the simplicity crosses ook ook
erasing<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.239> probably<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.230> fleet<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
erasing and probably the fleet here I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.809 
erasing and probably the fleet here I
think<00:02:51.750> they<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.080> hutch<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:55.640> now<00:02:56.640> we're

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
think they have hutch as well now we're

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.940 
think they have hutch as well now we're
going<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:56.970> cut<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.360> recording<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.530> second

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
going to cut the recording in a second

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.170 
going to cut the recording in a second
as<00:02:59.040> soon<00:02:59.190> as<00:02:59.250> we<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.489> if<00:02:59.579> simplicity<00:03:00.000> gets

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
as soon as we see if simplicity gets

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.059 
as soon as we see if simplicity gets
across<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.900> simplicity<00:03:01.500> leading<00:03:01.860> right<00:03:02.040> now

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
across so simplicity leading right now

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.940 
across so simplicity leading right now
wins<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> pin<00:03:03.150> end<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.599> crosses<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> fleet

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
wins the pin end and crosses the fleet

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.789 
wins the pin end and crosses the fleet
getting<00:03:05.489> they're<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:05.970> hip<00:03:06.090> up<00:03:06.269> on<00:03:06.450> hutch
