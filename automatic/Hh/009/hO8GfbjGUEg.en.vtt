00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.950
 yes now it is official there is or 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.929
 visual has confirmed that the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.570
 battlefield 3 beta next tuesday 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.719
 the third of february 2015 will start 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.730
 and until 8 february that is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 the following sunday available 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 and being playable that means we 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
 can be seen effectively five days 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.720
 long to test the beta 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 it was a bit surprised and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 even a little shit only five 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.240
 days that is actually neat 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 decent pressure you have because I 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.630
 really wants to get out as much as possible 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 pull out of the weser especially so much 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 as free as possible because if it 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.460
 Did not hear it in the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 beta no level limit that is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.090
 you can unlock everything that works 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890
 of course we only have three maps and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 three game modes available but weapons 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 gadget technically so everything was something synonymous 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 Vehicles and so you can if 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.030
 it manages to get up in the period 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 unlock and of course I want 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 tidy ran tapping orderly 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.800
 material biomass together and the whole 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.449
 of course in cool and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 informative videos for you out there 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.170
 to pack together and therefore start 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.120
 on tuesday a really cool action 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 because I will be available as soon as the beta 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 will not be none yet 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.850
 time known when that will be whether 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 in the morning at noon or on the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 I'm going to be stuck in the afternoon 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 that it 'll be more in the afternoon 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.200
 I do not live 24 hours live states 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.909
 that is on my table if 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 as soon as the beta will be available 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.040
 stream and then only 24 hours 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 many are doing online'll try 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 to unlock as much as possible 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 to unlock weapons 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 unlock how to find out 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.180
 certain things will work 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.009
 record a lot 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.960
 By the way, I'm sorting myself 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 have the folder system created to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.229
 watch that I have as much gameplay as possible 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.790
 Material accordingly pre-sorted 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 I did not have one at the end 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 recording takes 24 hours 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.490
 and then I turn himself in and out 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.720
 must flow ok where did I go with the 16 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.549
 played with the ak m 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.990
 okay just cut it together from there 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.610
 It may not only be interesting 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 Just play with me together 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.970
 to be there or just look like 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.369
 the beta is when you first yourself 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 not want to play beta will 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.219
 or maybe he does not know because he maybe 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.540
 the technical requirements are not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.710
 fulfilled then it is on the other 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.869
 Maybe also interesting 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.729
 to get a bit of insight as 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.500
 So at least the so everything with me as 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.509
 youtuber so expires and I because 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 at least try to organize myself 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.160
 the beta will open as already mentioned 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.120
 that means everyone can be with 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.460
 make and already have the opportunity 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.900
 on monday the preload to start the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.210
 means you can on Monday the beta 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.040
 already download and then on tuesday 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.810
 as soon as it becomes available directly 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.490
 Start if you have a short patch purely 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 he will not come, he can not be good 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.250
 was always back at the one 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.470
 or other release you must as well 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.690
 beta release but there we have to wait 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.010
 since we only have the short time of five 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.900
 I will have days available 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.690
 that's what I'm gonna do 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.940
 to stream into the mire every day and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.290
 Of course, only who the hair 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.330
 at least for the five days 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.550
 that also means that I'm starting from the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.200
 battlefield beta at digital provider 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.900
 speaks from tuesday in third february 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.700
 I will bring a video every day 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.380
 very important for you out there me 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.240
 first had my fix video days 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.830
 that you have three pieces in the week 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.710
 I've canceled it now 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.050
 will be starting the battlefield 3 beta every day 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.700
 enter a video to battlefield hook 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.080
 that will be at the beginning just during the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.000
 beta is still running because I do not have too much time 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
 have great work to do because of me 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 rather want to collect material and with 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.010
 you want to gamble in there 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.570
 livestream will probably be called 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.040
 first gameplay videos give that 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.930
 means I'll be the short gameplay 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.820
 videos with some cool scenes 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.320
 Cut together to respective weapons 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.200
 that means for example that it is a m 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.180
 16 3 video gives with m 16 a gameplay 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.800
 3 cut short with cool 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.720
 clubs cool kills around you once 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.950
 to give a little impression as the weapon 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.420
 the whole thing is playing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.980
 but not commented on it 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.930
 just seen purely figuratively 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.520
 could make an impression okay that would be something 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.870
 for me who the weapon for me how 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 skin the rows how does it look like 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.780
 to be a conclusion to that the 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.580
 first videos are the first time 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.770
 But uncommented are just gameplay 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.090
 uploaded in the highest quality the 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.860
 I'll be as good as it gets in highest 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.150
 quality out there so you as well 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.140
 what had for the eye which I mean 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.000
 I'll look into that, of course 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.830
 record ultra quality 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.209
 but that would be the first ones during the 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.930
 beta the first videos are me 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.700
 get out 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.739
 after the beta as I said it runs under 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.360
 five days will be decent consensus 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.010
 I have a huge list one 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.810
 Giant blackboard in front of me in equestrian sports stand 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.130
 things that I want to do that relate to 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.750
 not only on the phase after the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.520
 beta but of course also in the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.170
 Release of Haarklein and beyond 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.420
 But there are some things that we do 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.669
 just because of the beta analyze 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.260
 or a little bit through 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.660
 can think and just point it out 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.919
 synonymous content can deliver which you 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.900
 will probably be interested right now 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.550
 what what weapons tests simply addressing times 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.440
 so it first 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.720
 Show or even my opinion about it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.550
 reflect and you out there just 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.530
 let's inform what's in battlefield 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.570
 hagen so go because many are, however 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 rather aloof the game 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.050
 also to pick up what itself of course 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.970
 can understand because it is different what it is 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.530
 is a franchise but bad company was 2 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.120
 also franchise and that's it 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.950
 neatly hammered and is for 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 many with one of the best parts of the 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.100
 so far in the battle official 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.320
 came out is yes so that means 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.660
 for you neat livestream like 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.160
 said 24 hours stream on tuesday 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.620
 Let's start by, of course I will 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.110
 then posting was not going to be online 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.280
 will or if the beta be available 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.500
 we will hopefully be ahead of time 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.060
 already known when the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.280
 start time in Germany will be 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.090
 and then I'm online for 24 first 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.770
 hours then probably means 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.330
 sleep and then go online again 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.980
 sleep go online in between one 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.660
 bit gameplay what to cut together 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.560
 upload so you can take my breaks 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.630
 if I'm not right now 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.250
 online is also something of the gameplay too 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.440
 and then as soon as I come back 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.850
 online can start again 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.440
 I would be glad if you numerous 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.180
 be there and I believe many there 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.530
 many battlefield fans out there too 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.910
 Old-established the main canal 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.780
 maybe look forward to pursuing for some time 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.940
 now on the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.050

 I can only say I'm happy 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.930
