more<00:02:12.120> healthy

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
more healthy

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.920 
more healthy
and<00:02:12.620> being<00:02:13.070> stressed<00:02:13.640> yeah<00:02:14.090> there's<00:02:14.330> it's

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and being stressed yeah there's it's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
and being stressed yeah there's it's
it's<00:02:15.230> got<00:02:15.440> its<00:02:15.560> own<00:02:15.620> medical<00:02:16.040> benefits<00:02:16.490> I

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's got its own medical benefits I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's got its own medical benefits I
guess<00:02:17.020> it's<00:02:18.020> over-the-counter<00:02:18.610> perspective

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
guess it's over-the-counter perspective

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.100 
guess it's over-the-counter perspective
over-the-counter<00:02:21.440> solutions<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.460> problems

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
over-the-counter solutions to problems

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
over-the-counter solutions to problems
we're<00:02:24.110> gonna<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.320> an<00:02:24.440> ounce<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> half<00:02:25.540> like

and there you go how about the authentic

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.410 
and there you go how about the authentic
recipe<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.630> found<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.940> didn't<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
recipe I found that I didn't like the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.850 
recipe I found that I didn't like the
fact<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.750> didn't<00:02:39.080> use<00:02:39.200> coconut<00:02:39.650> rum<00:02:39.800> I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
fact that didn't use coconut rum I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.440 
fact that didn't use coconut rum I
really<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.459> coconut<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.060> was<00:02:41.180> using

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
really like coconut and it was using

really like coconut and it was using
standard<00:02:41.840> white<00:02:42.020> rum<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.830> thought<00:02:43.160> I'd<00:02:43.400> kick

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
standard white rum so I thought I'd kick

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.640 
standard white rum so I thought I'd kick
it<00:02:44.060> into<00:02:44.180> high<00:02:44.300> gear<00:02:44.420> or<00:02:44.780> some<00:02:44.900> coconut<00:02:45.320> rum<00:02:45.470> so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it into high gear or some coconut rum so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.590 
it into high gear or some coconut rum so
that's<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.130> how<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.459> happened<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.570> you

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's that's how that happened so you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.290 
that's that's how that happened so you
may<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.110> Paul<00:02:48.320> oh<00:02:48.350> no<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.700> was<00:02:49.790> my<00:02:49.820> own<00:02:50.060> I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
just do that I did a substitution on the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.010 
just do that I did a substitution on the
fly<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:55.580> made<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.300> my<00:02:56.420> own<00:02:56.450> by<00:02:56.750> calling

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
fly I made it my own by calling

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:13.870 
fly I made it my own by calling
inaudible<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.830> mine<00:03:04.040> frame<00:03:12.730> all<00:03:13.730> right

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
inaudible in the mine frame all right

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.449 
inaudible in the mine frame all right
see<00:03:14.480> how<00:03:14.510> we<00:03:14.840> did<00:03:15.110> on<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> amount<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.190> ice<00:03:16.310> we

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
see how we did on the amount of ice we

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:34.570 
see how we did on the amount of ice we
got

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.950 

the<00:03:35.580> cool<00:03:35.790> thing<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.210> shake<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.570> up<00:03:36.780> you

the cool thing is to shake this up you

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:58.839 
the cool thing is to shake this up you
can<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.140> watch

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.160 

now<00:03:59.849> there's<00:04:00.030> some<00:04:00.180> ice<00:04:00.360> chunks<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.019> so

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
but I don't think it's gonna work very

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
but I don't think it's gonna work very
well<00:04:04.110> especially<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.489> being<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:05.970> harsh

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
well especially with this being so harsh

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:24.190 
well especially with this being so harsh
that's<00:04:07.110> not<00:04:07.319> gonna<00:04:07.470> work<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.799> all<00:04:07.890> huh
