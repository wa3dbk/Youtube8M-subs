00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.040
 A) Yes 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.690
 or fuck this happens to me for trusting in a 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.690
 demon in a judas 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.880
 I've been surviving since 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.520
 beginning to hundreds of infected to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.470
 hundreds of zombies to hundreds of monsters 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.510
 and everything has gone to hell for a 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.540
 fucking montero the road has been 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.160
 tremendously long column I lost to 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.680
 all my family in all 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.890
 belongings the only thing that kept me 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.860
 alive was my ak-47 and the fear of being 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.840
 devoured by those beasts maybe only 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.180
 perhaps this is the best way to 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.790
 finish like all this saying goodbye 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.340
 once for all my last 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.290
 words that all people at 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.960
 that I have met have found peace 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.450
 and that all those beasts play from the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.580
 best possible way and I'm sure that 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.009
 sooner or later those beasts fall by 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.610
 your own ibex and worn by the river 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.840
 by the heat and that someday God 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.660
 rebuild to this world rough sea 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.550
 corrupted by war for addiction by 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.830
 the money and now for this apocalypse 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.830
 zombie for this hecatomb etc 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.310
 ah 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 or not 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.280
 good 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.280
 ah 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 two 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.520
 ah
