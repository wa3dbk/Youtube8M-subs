00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
minimizer some of the projects that we

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.740 
minimizer some of the projects that we
work<00:00:11.890> on<00:00:12.070> are<00:00:12.370> injection<00:00:12.940> molded<00:00:13.240> components

work on are injection molded components

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.240 
work on are injection molded components
and<00:00:13.930> primarily<00:00:14.380> right<00:00:14.590> now<00:00:14.770> looking<00:00:15.160> at

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
and primarily right now looking at

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.099 
and primarily right now looking at
several<00:00:15.580> mounting<00:00:15.940> brackets<00:00:16.419> a<00:00:16.660> lot<00:00:16.929> of<00:00:17.019> these

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:17.109 
several mounting brackets a lot of these

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.650 
several mounting brackets a lot of these
parts<00:00:17.410> are<00:00:17.650> made<00:00:18.429> from<00:00:18.490> glass<00:00:18.880> fiber<00:00:19.269> and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
parts are made from glass fiber and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.859 
parts are made from glass fiber and
rough<00:00:20.320> rugged<00:00:20.890> plastic<00:00:21.789> materials<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.689> so

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
rough rugged plastic materials and so

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.870 
rough rugged plastic materials and so
it's<00:00:23.589> a<00:00:23.679> challenge<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.160> prototype<00:00:24.640> those

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
it's a challenge to prototype those

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.939 
it's a challenge to prototype those
products<00:00:25.390> with<00:00:25.749> the<00:00:25.869> black<00:00:26.079> Ultima<00:00:26.589> Tyrael

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
products with the black Ultima Tyrael

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.130 
products with the black Ultima Tyrael
it's<00:00:27.279> very<00:00:27.640> high<00:00:28.089> tensile<00:00:28.390> strength<00:00:28.869> and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
it's very high tensile strength and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.739 
it's very high tensile strength and
rigid<00:00:29.560> we<00:00:29.890> found<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.909> black<00:00:31.119> alton<00:00:31.539> is<00:00:31.659> a

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
rigid we found that the black alton is a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.600 
rigid we found that the black alton is a
good<00:00:31.900> alternative<00:00:32.079> for<00:00:32.650> us<00:00:32.770> to<00:00:33.100> prototype

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
good alternative for us to prototype

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.670 
good alternative for us to prototype
these<00:00:33.880> mounting<00:00:34.420> brackets<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:34.990> even<00:00:35.290> take

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
these mounting brackets and even take

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.130 
these mounting brackets and even take
them<00:00:35.890> out<00:00:36.070> into<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.460> field<00:00:36.580> on<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.510> truck<00:00:37.870> and

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
them out into the field on a truck and

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:51.880 
them out into the field on a truck and
and<00:00:38.680> test<00:00:38.920> them<00:00:39.100> out

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.160 

when<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> make<00:00:53.220> an<00:00:53.370> FDM<00:00:53.790> part<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.450> mounted<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
when we make an FDM part we mounted on a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.900 
when we make an FDM part we mounted on a
truck<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.740> a<00:00:55.770> lot<00:00:56.040> of<00:00:56.070> times<00:00:56.340> they'll<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> lot

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
truck so a lot of times they'll be a lot

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.050 
truck so a lot of times they'll be a lot
of<00:00:57.030> drilling<00:00:57.330> using<00:00:58.110> fasteners<00:00:58.880> even<00:00:59.880> mating

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
of drilling using fasteners even mating

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.930 
of drilling using fasteners even mating
parts<00:01:00.630> together<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:01.320> black<00:01:02.070> Ultima<00:01:02.580> Tyrael

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
parts together the black Ultima Tyrael

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
parts together the black Ultima Tyrael
is<00:01:03.060> valuable<00:01:03.540> because<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.530> needs<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
is valuable because if there needs to be

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
is valuable because if there needs to be
any<00:01:05.129> sanding<00:01:05.850> or<00:01:06.180> cutting<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> part<00:01:07.410> it

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
any sanding or cutting of the part it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
any sanding or cutting of the part it
allows<00:01:07.920> us<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.250> flexibility<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.940> do<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.290> but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
allows us the flexibility to do that but

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.330 
allows us the flexibility to do that but
still<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.860> aesthetically<00:01:11.250> pleasing

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
still have an aesthetically pleasing

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.790 
still have an aesthetically pleasing
part<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> vehicle<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.470> reason

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
part to put on the vehicle the reason

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.900 
part to put on the vehicle the reason
for<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> black<00:01:14.160> I'll<00:01:14.400> tell<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.729> they<00:01:14.820> were

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
for the black I'll tell them they were

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.820 
for the black I'll tell them they were
excited<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.140> 90<00:01:16.560> percent

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
excited to see that is that's 90 percent

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.930 
excited to see that is that's 90 percent
of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> color<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.340> product<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> our

actually using the product in Road
trials<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> album<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.899> they<00:01:25.680> decided

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
trials with the album and they decided

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.359 
trials with the album and they decided
that<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.450> order<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.780> application<00:01:28.530> we

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that you know order this application we

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
that you know order this application we
don't<00:01:29.550> need<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> many<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.540> tool<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
don't need that many to tool up for it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
don't need that many to tool up for it
so<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.070> print<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.399> out<00:01:32.990> 15

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so if you could just print this out 15

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.260 
so if you could just print this out 15
of<00:01:34.140> these<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.830> for<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.190> military<00:01:35.759> contract

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of these it's for a military contract

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.930 
of these it's for a military contract
and<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.140> need<00:01:37.290> 15<00:01:37.680> units<00:01:38.009> right<00:01:38.160> now<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
and they just need 15 units right now so

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.370 
and they just need 15 units right now so
we<00:01:39.119> said<00:01:39.300> okay<00:01:39.570> give<00:01:39.720> us<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> part<00:01:40.229> back

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
we said okay give us that part back

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
we said okay give us that part back
we'll<00:01:40.619> give<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> Altima<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> black<00:01:41.790> and
