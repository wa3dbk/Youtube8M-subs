the<00:00:31.439> 44<00:00:32.009> split<00:00:32.600> formation<00:00:33.600> um<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.350> pretty

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the 44 split formation um it's pretty

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.490 
the 44 split formation um it's pretty
good<00:00:34.950> use<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.670> seems<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.260> set

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
good use it seems like it's a lot to set

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
good use it seems like it's a lot to set
up<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.100> practice<00:00:38.340> mode<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.149> it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
up in this practice mode but it's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
up in this practice mode but it's
basically<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:40.020> based<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.829> lining<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
basically just based on lining and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.540 
basically just based on lining and
globally<00:00:42.030> blitzing<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.480> line<00:00:42.570> backers<00:00:43.260> um

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
globally blitzing the line backers um

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.590 
globally blitzing the line backers um
that's<00:00:44.550> pretty<00:00:44.760> much<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.480> about

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that's pretty much as what it's about

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930 
that's pretty much as what it's about
but<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.920> spy<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but you can see we spy the two on the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
but you can see we spy the two on the
left<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:49.289> put<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> middle<00:00:50.520> linebacker

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
left and we put the middle linebacker

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
left and we put the middle linebacker
leather<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.840> night<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.530> yellow<00:00:52.770> zone<00:00:52.860> we

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
leather one night in the yellow zone we

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.650 
leather one night in the yellow zone we
put<00:00:53.460> him<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> QB<00:00:54.510> contain<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
put him in the QB contain which can it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
put him in the QB contain which can it
confuses<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.899> whole<00:00:58.109> left<00:00:58.410> side<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.890> line

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
confuses the whole left side of the line

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.119 
confuses the whole left side of the line
which<00:00:59.430> allows<00:00:59.760> them<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.899> allows<00:01:01.289> us<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.859> put

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
which allows them was allows us to put

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.299 
which allows them was allows us to put
the<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.520> guys<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> spy<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.530> allows<00:01:05.040> us

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the two guys in the spy so it allows us

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
the two guys in the spy so it allows us
to<00:01:05.460> fake<00:01:05.729> blitz<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> three-man<00:01:06.810> edge

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to fake blitz with the three-man edge

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
to fake blitz with the three-man edge
and<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:08.010> how<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and that's how we do we get it from the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.410 
and that's how we do we get it from the
right<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.659> twice<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.189> also

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
right side twice and it's also

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.850 
right side twice and it's also
unsolvable<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.380> block<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> run

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
unsolvable so they have to block and run

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.520 
unsolvable so they have to block and run
it<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.400> block<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> three-man<00:01:15.299> blitz<00:01:15.750> which

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it back to block a three-man blitz which

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.010 
it back to block a three-man blitz which
is<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> amazing<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.509> they

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is pretty amazing because now if they

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
is pretty amazing because now if they
block<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.860> running<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.729> great

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
block of running back we have great

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
block of running back we have great
coverage<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> top<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:23.310> two

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
coverage over the top is basically two

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
coverage over the top is basically two
yellows<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.810> user<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.290> over<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> middle

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
yellows and your user in over the middle

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.539 
yellows and your user in over the middle
and<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.909> Purple's<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> three

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
and two Purple's out there and three

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.429 
and two Purple's out there and three
dark<00:01:29.549> deep<00:01:29.970> blues<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.450> guard<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:30.900> deep<00:01:31.140> which

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
dark deep blues to guard your deep which

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
dark deep blues to guard your deep which
usually<00:01:31.680> gets<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.000> trouble

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
usually gets you out a lot of trouble

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.569 
usually gets you out a lot of trouble
but<00:01:33.900> probably<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> those<00:01:34.680> same<00:01:35.009> routes<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
but probably one of those same routes is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
but probably one of those same routes is
what<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> watch<00:01:36.750> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
what you're going to have to watch but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
what you're going to have to watch but
you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> bring<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.979> blitz<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> left

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you can bring this blitz from the left

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.539 
you can bring this blitz from the left
from<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.930> doesn't<00:01:40.170> matter<00:01:40.530> um<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
from the right it doesn't matter um you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.210 
from the right it doesn't matter um you
just<00:01:41.579> saw<00:01:42.030> edge<00:01:42.479> rush<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> deal<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.950> you

the outside wide receiver against that
double<00:03:17.910> edge<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.390> they'd<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.540> open<00:03:18.810> but

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
double edge and they'd be open but
