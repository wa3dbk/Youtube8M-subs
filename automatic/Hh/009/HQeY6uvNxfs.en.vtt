this model this is the ideal choice for

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.590 
this model this is the ideal choice for
your<00:00:38.600> x99<00:00:39.380> platform<00:00:39.980> on<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:40.760> model<00:00:40.970> you<00:00:41.390> will

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
your x99 platform on this model you will

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.640 
your x99 platform on this model you will
see<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.960> lot<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.200> new<00:00:42.469> features<00:00:42.770> from<00:00:43.730> issues

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
see a lot of new features from issues

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.710 
see a lot of new features from issues
the<00:00:45.650> very<00:00:45.920> key<00:00:46.310> features<00:00:46.820> we<00:00:47.030> have<00:00:47.060> on<00:00:47.570> this

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
the very key features we have on this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.920 
the very key features we have on this
ball<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.590> OC<00:00:49.070> socket<00:00:49.580> with<00:00:50.330> this<00:00:50.510> OC

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
ball is the OC socket with this OC

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.210 
ball is the OC socket with this OC
socket<00:00:51.580> we<00:00:52.580> actually<00:00:53.090> have<00:00:53.470> provide<00:00:54.470> extra

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
socket we actually have provide extra

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.780 
socket we actually have provide extra
more<00:00:55.790> pins<00:00:56.120> for<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:56.990> socket<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.579> will

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
more pins for this socket so it will

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.230 
more pins for this socket so it will
provide<00:00:59.180> improved<00:01:00.100> stability<00:01:01.100> when<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.000> add

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
provide improved stability when you add

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.420 
provide improved stability when you add
in<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.480> voltage<00:01:02.840> when<00:01:03.740> you<00:01:03.860> do<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
in the voltage when you do in the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.330 
in the voltage when you do in the
overclocking<00:01:04.970> either<00:01:05.720> for<00:01:06.140> your<00:01:06.259> CPU<00:01:06.590> also
