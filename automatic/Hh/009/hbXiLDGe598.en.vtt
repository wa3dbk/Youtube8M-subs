 hi to all and did the job in 2014 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 then dropped on the deviated stand which 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 just announced a new series 1 and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.370
 series 3 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.670
 she 35 for a quick presentation 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.090
 35 it's independent and viable 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.730
 be aware that the higher the price 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.210
 the ragman 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.589
 hand 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.550
 the range increases a trainee involved 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.550
 the 35 and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.460
 40 for example is a little bit better 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.130
 we had the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.490
 and 80 90 is the skin 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 prayers phone figuration low costs 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.430
 also increase 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 so we had 35 it's really a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150
 entry level 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.770
 maximum 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.579
 a processor a blow of dual giguÃ¨re 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.429
 core a screen first drops of thumb 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.429
 ps 480 by 320 it's basic 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.590
 together we are sure it's still 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.740
 was bet battery 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.460
 san millan father exactly 1540 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.170
 the camera e.g. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 her neighbor without flash 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 1 megapixel 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.890
 camera in the front of course this entry 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 of range while they are going to take a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.299
 dual sim idea 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.299
 here 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.750
 so you see we can handle two 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.790
 sim cards really did range which 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.300
 had 4 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.260
 all well 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.750
 other 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.520
 it is at lg same entrances dia 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.800
 no no it was a massacre 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's not the entry level 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.430
 we do a little too much no it's 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.060
 really from lens was mine 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060
 3 megapixels 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.290
 in children's range 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.140
 we have 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.140
 android 4 - 4 that a time 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 see finally that's it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 benefit 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.780
 points 4th range 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.140
 now that there is really hungry what 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.790
 is not easy and we 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.480
 this games 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.480
 during very high quality 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.280
 regarding the practices of the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.290
 phone 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 this is the basic see it 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.900
 they did they do 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.549
 the back at the back is pretty cool 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.170
 it's plastic to its textures and 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's not brilliant plastic in itself 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 and no figures 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.650
 this range 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.650

 a quick presentation 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.970
 35 1 entry level 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.800
