 many sites idea for home and family kia 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.140
 today we will talk to you and the inner 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.049
 wardrobe structure 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.209
 before you start betting on 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.530
 yourself and order a theme we decide important 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:16.550
 question 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.420
 to increase coupon rate 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.460
 such material will be made but not less 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.779
 important question 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.269
 how much money will have no 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.210
 inner side 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.240
 solving this issue we are now 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.819
 doing 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.170
 consider the most popular cabinets 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.630
 coupe 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.630
 pay attention to drawing 1 and 2 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.930
 these cabinets are small 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.380
 they can do it like children 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.050
 one of which is porch hanging on 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.090
 shoulders 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720
 and the second day I am completely filled 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.670
 foul 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.560
 Berkova because these shelves 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.870
 and if this closet example will stand 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.060
 in the hall 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.720
 on this by both residents place 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.659
 step kim 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.700
 gloves scarves 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.880
 the top shelf itself is usually 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.270
 intended 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
 commission which is often the way 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.860
 valuables 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 Aspeka on this shelf would shoes 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.780
 peeking from time to time 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.510
 we recommend you body day from ignorance 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 birch bark novel 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 well use cellular st 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.560
 This metal shelves large 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.830
 advantage is the shelf table 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.280
 that dust does not accumulate on them 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 just not visible 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.430
 pieces they price this floor 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.260
 recommend using these 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.500
 tent courts if your bld high 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 two meters 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.390
 again we see examples of wardrobes with 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.120
 cellular floor 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.510
 on the top shelf 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.319
 Yushchenko 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.059
 can be stacked in a box for example in 

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.890
 region 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.610
 so it is and such peaks have a special regiment 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.730
 happening 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.579
 consider figures 3 and 4 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.929
 and here we add to the bottom corner 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.229
 ordinary use on debt 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.229
 Again, we recommend using a cellular 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.510
 such an opinion that at least as we see 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.899
 on the field 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.809
 choose the number of shelves 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.869
 the distance between them also depends on 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.299
 what exactly will be stored on these 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.739
 points 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.029
 the premiere 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 some shelves can be made retractable 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.239
 Consider the department where it is located 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.519
 just for clothes 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.999
 for convenience you can replace forever 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.749
 on board 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.769
 especially if the cabinet is tall enough 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.209
 on the picture 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.229
 you see the principle of the pantograph 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:13.269
 using special chicago 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.299
 we calmly reach or vice versa 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.329
 collect things to the ceiling of the fine 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.779
 generally recommend 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.759
 for the next season, how do we look at the three 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.319
 sectional cabinets 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.169
 you see that in two compartments 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.229
 established salad Dagestan 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.249
 since the cabinet is high 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.990
 such an opinion 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.359
 we have the opportunity location pitch 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.359
 at the level 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.489
 this is a place to store such things 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.719
 as 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.369
 shirts 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:54.709
 skirts 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.349
 jackets 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.789
 jackets 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.029
 jim pen 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.349
 etc 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.029
 the selection division of the use of the United States 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.099
 no positive things like the example of wine and 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.689
 fur coats 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.669
 so 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.159
 sadder long dresses and because 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.399
 could 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.529
 the third branch by example 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.389
 two-piece closet we completely 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.789
 perform the floor 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.279
 adjustment 6 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.050
 as an option 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.770
 in one of the institutions 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.639
 where is the chance 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.999
 you can install an additional shelf 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.309
 hem 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:32.490
 to the top 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.139
 again recommended 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.139
 install cellular flooring 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.680
 Further 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.300
 another internal option 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.759
 filling cabinets 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.850
 look at 1 47 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.800
 there are already two branches completely 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.759
 filled with shelves 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.759
 one is for miss 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.029
 and shining on the defendants 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.430
 in figure 8 see 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.409
 that the allocation of 50 people keeps at home 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.879
 Irkut and down 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.879
 located on the street 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.479
 however many shelves there will always be 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.159
 what was put there 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.940
 the next day in the morning 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.380
 you see on the left and the right side 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.180
 cabinets 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.160
 located console shelves they 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.160
 comfortable enough 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.289
 they can use software 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.620
 interior stuff 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.800
 pumping 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.039
 figurines 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.259
 nicknames 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.039
 and this foundation 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.039
 etc 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.580
 then we look at the wardrobes from heaven 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.120
 less brighter 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.900
 where did you usually keep valuables 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.380
 who don't want to show 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.449
 to a stranger's eye 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.220
 and use boxes as small things so they 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.479
 were all in one place and always 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.479
 it was just mail 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.770
 the court next day regarding 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.259
 drawer locations 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.259
 their number 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.710
 in figure 14 again we draw your 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.789
 Attention 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.789
