00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.620
 chess game we have a position 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.120
 in which we see that the black one is not 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 very developed have still in the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.130
 last row bishop and tower and we have a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 tactical theme with which White 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 wins the game is worth for the video as 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.430
 always to see if they guess what the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.240
 correct play white is a move of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.460
 interception and the correct play is 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.460
 tower of 7 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.250
 and the black one have to deliver her lady or 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 capture capture with the lady 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.079
 tower 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.079
 with the bishop 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 but in both cases 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.790
 White has a pretty good advantage 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.920
 advantage if capture by the horse 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.559
 Obviously they will leave this pawn 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 for the horse lady combination and this 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 because they are 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.729
 hampering the range let's see with the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:18.070
 horseback horse by 7 would come a 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:21.010
 mate 3 with lady for efe 7-8 lady 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.760
 and eight check to the black one they have no more 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.760
 to be covered and lady for 18 checkmate 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.340
 let's see if you capture with the bishop that 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.020
 pass bishop by 7 then come lady 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:53.050
 by efe 7 sorry the king is here lady 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 by efe 7 check king h 8 and bishop c4 are 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.710
 threatening a checkmate on g8 the black 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.360
 they have to remove the horse so that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.759
 tower cover g8 and the best move is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.300
 horse is 6 the best move between 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.090
 bad 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.650
 we go the position and the game was already 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.150
 lost by black 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.980
 but always you horse 6 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 they do horse and 6 is even worse because the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 white have the theme mate 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 tactical that the white ones take advantage of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.459
 delivering the lady since they can not 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.319
 capture with the king because he is 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.709
 defended by the bishop have to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.459
 capture with the tower and checkmate with 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.030
 the horse a checkmate of the thing is worth 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.739
 is intercepting the lady's action 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.360
 hindered and can not can not 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.110
 do nothing 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.110
 so that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 Black has to play horse 6 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.260
 to cover the action and also cover the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.550
 box but now they have to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.450
 deliver to the lady also because 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.110
 after horse for 6 white 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.940
 are threatening a mate here at 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.730
 Blacks have practically no more 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.220
 remedy to take the horse throw 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.220
 with the bishop and is agreed 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.050
 delivering the lady and now yes bishop 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.780
 bishop then with lady of 7 and in the lady 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.390
 by tower and bishop besides this powerful 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.670
 past pawn and position the game 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.990
 is won by white we are going to 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.990
 return to the previous position 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.819
 maybe we have seen that the play to 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.360
 horse by tower leads to a check 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.330
 mate we have seen that also the move d 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.750
 to the cic by tower the blacks are 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.990
 lost and let's see how they are also 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 lost with lady by 7 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.230
 delivering the lady 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:21.459
 at last for lady and here then at last for 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.670
 lady at last for bishop queen for efe seven 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:29.530
 check king h 8 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.930
 lady of 5 is worth and here now they are 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.920
 threatening a lot of threats with 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.280
 horse efe 7 check and then come the 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.560
 discovered with the lady 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.710
 are touching this pawn is both when 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.530
 this pawn are playing the bishop that is not 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.230
 you can stop defending yourself with the horse 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.650
 and the white get a big advantage 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.770
 I could follow h6 to give it a 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.460
 escape to the king a horse makes seven 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.830
 check 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.540
 laugh h7 and lady to see 7 touching the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.100
 tower 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.100
 touching this file 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.490
 touching this pawn when the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.130
 tower and practically because the black one is 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.740
 very lost in this good position 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.020

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.520
