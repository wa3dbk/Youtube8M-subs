00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Polaris RZR you can see we've got it in

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.999 
Polaris RZR you can see we've got it in
the<00:00:10.950> box<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:12.240> fits<00:00:12.570> perfect<00:00:13.080> side<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> side

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the box now it fits perfect side to side

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.590 
the box now it fits perfect side to side
I've<00:00:14.460> added<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.199> thin<00:00:16.199> piece<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:17.300> real<00:00:18.300> tight

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
I've added a thin piece of real tight

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
I've added a thin piece of real tight
cell<00:00:18.960> foam<00:00:19.380> we've<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> picture<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
cell foam we've got a picture of it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010 
cell foam we've got a picture of it
right<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.390> something<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> came

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
right here it's just something that came

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 
right here it's just something that came
out<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> packing<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.150> DVR<00:00:24.150> player<00:00:24.539> or

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
out of packing from a DVR player or

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.150 
out of packing from a DVR player or
something<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.289> I've<00:00:25.710> got<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> piece<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
something like that I've got a piece of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.220 
something like that I've got a piece of
that<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> bottom<00:00:26.939> because<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.750> bottom<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that in the bottom because the bottom of

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.220 
that in the bottom because the bottom of
the<00:00:28.349> battery<00:00:28.529> box<00:00:29.090> has<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.330> indentation<00:00:30.660> with

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the battery box has an indentation with

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
the battery box has an indentation with
a<00:00:31.260> hole<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.910> makes<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.450> batteries

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
a hole and that just makes the batteries

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
a hole and that just makes the batteries
be<00:00:34.020> supported<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> perimeter<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> cut<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
be supported on the perimeter so I cut a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250 
be supported on the perimeter so I cut a
piece<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> slid<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
piece of this and slid it in that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250 
piece of this and slid it in that
indentation<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.750> battery<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> like

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
indentation and the battery is like

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
indentation and the battery is like
floating<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.340> punched<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> hole<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
floating on that now punched a hole in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.130 
floating on that now punched a hole in
the<00:00:42.660> foam<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:45.030> mates<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> water

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the foam so it mates up with the water

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.959 
the foam so it mates up with the water
drain<00:00:46.500> hole<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:46.980> built<00:00:47.219> into<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> Polaris

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

I<00:00:50.190> added<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:51.030> aluminum<00:00:51.510> tabs<00:00:51.920> on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.879> both

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
I added some aluminum tabs on the both

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
I added some aluminum tabs on the both
the<00:00:54.510> positive<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> negative<00:00:55.260> posts<00:00:56.070> here

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the positive and the negative posts here

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.670 
the positive and the negative posts here
because<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> whole<00:00:57.989> arrangement<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because just the whole arrangement of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
because just the whole arrangement of
getting<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> cables<00:00:59.399> bent<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.390> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
getting the cables bent up in there I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
getting the cables bent up in there I
didn't<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.680> I'll<00:01:02.160> wrap<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.670> post<00:01:03.000> here

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
in a heavy-duty 88 or 33 3m tape to keep
anything<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.270> doing<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> dead<00:01:10.110> short<00:01:10.380> right

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
anything from doing a dead short right

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
anything from doing a dead short right
here<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> larger

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
here and I'm also gonna put a larger

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.469 
here and I'm also gonna put a larger
positive<00:01:13.400> plastic<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.580> rubber<00:01:14.760> boot<00:01:15.090> over

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
positive plastic or rubber boot over

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
positive plastic or rubber boot over
that<00:01:15.659> something<00:01:16.470> automotive<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.400> don't

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that something automotive I just don't

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
that something automotive I just don't
have<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.000> today<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.840> that'll<00:01:19.380> slide<00:01:19.650> over

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have one today and that'll slide over

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
have one today and that'll slide over
and<00:01:20.100> protect<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.700> those<00:01:20.880> cables<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.630> we

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and protect all those cables because we

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
and protect all those cables because we
sure<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.619> short<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.400> situation

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
sure don't want a short out situation

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
sure don't want a short out situation
but<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.080> allowed<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> tighten<00:01:26.280> these

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
but now it allowed me to tighten these

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.270 
but now it allowed me to tighten these
aluminum<00:01:27.150> tabs<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> correct<00:01:28.740> torque<00:01:28.979> up

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
aluminum tabs with a correct torque up

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.480 
aluminum tabs with a correct torque up
against<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.329> battery<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> drilled

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
against the battery and then I drilled

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
against the battery and then I drilled
another<00:01:32.640> hole<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.270> tabs<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:33.990> my

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
another hole in these tabs and now my

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
another hole in these tabs and now my
cables<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.340> tight<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.119> which

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
cables are really tight over here which

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
cables are really tight over here which
is<00:01:36.329> always<00:01:36.780> something<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.409> feel<00:01:37.650> like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
is always something you just feel like

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
is always something you just feel like
you<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.130> need<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.610> tightening<00:01:39.030> them

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you really need to be tightening them

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
you really need to be tightening them
but<00:01:39.990> I've<00:01:40.259> been<00:01:40.560> through<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.860> before<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
but I've been through it before you can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.429 
but I've been through it before you can
punch<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> threads<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.079> strip<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
punch the threads out to strip the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.870 
punch the threads out to strip the
threads<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.040> punch<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> bolt<00:01:44.640> through

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
threads out or punch the bolt through

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
threads out or punch the bolt through
the<00:01:44.909> front<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> battery<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:45.960> you're

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the front of the battery and now you're

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.160 
the front of the battery and now you're
out<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> water<00:01:47.390> now<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> battery<00:01:48.899> being

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
out of the water now the battery being

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
out of the water now the battery being
higher<00:01:50.030> what<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> ran<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:51.960> exactly

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
higher what I ran into and it's exactly

higher what I ran into and it's exactly
five<00:01:52.829> eighths<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.369> inch<00:01:53.460> taller<00:01:53.820> than<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
five eighths of an inch taller than the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
five eighths of an inch taller than the
factory<00:01:55.290> battery<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.159> standing<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
factory battery when it's standing in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
factory battery when it's standing in
its<00:01:56.820> normal<00:01:57.060> position<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> came<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.009> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
its normal position so I came up with a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.850 
its normal position so I came up with a
couple<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> these<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.719> plastic<00:02:00.860> bushings

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
couple of these little plastic bushings

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
couple of these little plastic bushings
that<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> had<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.119> they're<00:02:03.270> out

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that I had I don't know what they're out

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
that I had I don't know what they're out
of<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.750> something<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.170> threw<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.469> my<00:02:04.619> spare

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of just something I threw in my spare

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
of just something I threw in my spare
parts<00:02:05.759> kit<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.530> I've<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:07.950> plastic

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
parts kit and I've got these plastic

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.680 
parts kit and I've got these plastic
bushings<00:02:08.970> underneath<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
bushings underneath of the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.210 
bushings underneath of the
the<00:02:11.959> strap<00:02:12.260> right<00:02:12.500> there<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.920> course<00:02:12.950> I

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the strap right there and of course I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.830 
the strap right there and of course I
had<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> lengthen<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.970> bolts<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.510> think<00:02:14.750> I

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
had a lengthen the bolts and I think I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.619 
had a lengthen the bolts and I think I
used<00:02:15.080> an<00:02:15.260> inch<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> quarter<00:02:15.920> bolt<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:17.300> there

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
used an inch and a quarter bolt on there

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.420 
used an inch and a quarter bolt on there
because<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.140> factory<00:02:18.530> bolts<00:02:18.860> won't<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.190> long

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
because the factory bolts won't be long

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.300 
because the factory bolts won't be long
enough<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> reach<00:02:20.769> mmm<00:02:21.860> I've<00:02:21.920> got<00:02:22.099> them

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310
