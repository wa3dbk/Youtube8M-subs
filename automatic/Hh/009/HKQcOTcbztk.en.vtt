00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello welcome to the kitchen for all 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.960
 today we are going to make pork sirloin with 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.430
 pepper sauce ingredients 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.790
 we will need for four people 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.070
 They are the following 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.080
 two white onions 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.230
 2 garlic cloves half glass of brandy 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.030
 a whole glass of the half glass tumbler 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.260
 of oil 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.040
 Pepper 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.990
 salt and 750 grams of pork tenderloin 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.750
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.940
 our steer I'm going to cut it to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.940
 steaks putting the hand 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.149
 and cutting if no steaks come out like that if 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.489
 you can cut the medallions that 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.780
 because it 's like that but I prefer 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 to steaks 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.079
 when we already have the sirloin filleted 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.760
 let's move on to cut the onions 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.800
 there is no need for the court and much 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.800
 because then we're going to beat them 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.630
 once we have finished cutting the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 onion we put a pan on the fire and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.190
 we add half a glass of oil it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.320
 we put to heat to the maximum 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.320
 and while we're going to cut the garlic 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.619
 once we have the hot oil 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.619
 let's put sirloin steaks 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.530
 once we have no eyes we add 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.530
 Salt 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.570
 and we turn them over only you have to 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.570
 seal it 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.590
 once the steaks were sealed 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.740
 on both sides we separate it from the fire 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.740
 and we carefully add the brandy 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.410
 we move it a little 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.350
 we put it back on fire at 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 maximum 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.080
 and we hope to move it until it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.080
 reduce 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.410
 you can also raise but my father 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.020
 I'm not leaving 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.730
 the great ocean of the children 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.730
 and we can take out the steaks 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.319
 you have to leave the oil in it 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.319
 skillet 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.010
 then add the onion and the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.140
 garlic in the same pan where we have done 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.580
 the steaks in which the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.000
 rest oil and brandy 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.410
 we add 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.050
 and we leave this car from time to time what 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.420
 you have to move when we already have 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.580
 onion and heras as you guys 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.580
 we add the glass of cream 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.080
 and we add a tad of salt 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.080
 we move everything well 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.260
 and we leave it for a few minutes not much 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.260
 because now it is not going to curdle 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.300
 Two minutes have passed and you're ready 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.319
 so we add living names 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.640
 that now let's beat 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.640
 and we started to beat 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.400
 when we have finished beating 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.320
 there is a sauce with this texture the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.910
 you can try and if you see what those are 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.430
 things you throw a little out of 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.550
 beat again once we already have 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.140
 well then we put the steaks another 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.180
 once the arts 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.180
 and we add all our sauce 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.520
 92 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.930
 we put it 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.930
 to the fire to the maximum 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.209
 and we add pepper you have to add 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.829
 enough quantity but always at 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.590
 taste but so that this movement 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.360
 it has to be a lot of quantity we have already 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.830
 finished to add the pepper and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.840
 our sauce is already made 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.930
 put out the fire and let's move on to 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.020
 I'm putting them like this by presenting in a 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.020
 plate 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.180

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.920
