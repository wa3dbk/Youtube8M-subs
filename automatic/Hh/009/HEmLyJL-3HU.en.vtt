see<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.830> Sun<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.039> whole<00:02:07.250> lot<00:02:07.489> looking<00:02:08.090> at<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
see the Sun a whole lot looking at the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.910 
see the Sun a whole lot looking at the
lap<00:02:08.450> times<00:02:08.780> at<00:02:08.989> least<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.259> top<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.679> sheet

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
lap times at least the top of the sheet

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.190 
lap times at least the top of the sheet
I<00:02:10.310> don't<00:02:10.819> know<00:02:10.879> if<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.030> could<00:02:11.090> say<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> felt<00:02:11.750> every

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
I don't know if I could say I felt every

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
I don't know if I could say I felt every
single<00:02:12.530> team<00:02:12.680> was<00:02:12.920> truly<00:02:13.520> trying<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.880> get

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
single team was truly trying to get

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.550 
single team was truly trying to get
every<00:02:14.270> drop<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.570> speed<00:02:14.900> out<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.170> cars<00:02:15.380> are

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
every drop of speed out of the cars are

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.050 
every drop of speed out of the cars are
a<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.710> bit<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.920> gamesmanship<00:02:16.130> you're<00:02:16.880> not

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
a little bit of gamesmanship you're not

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.590 
a little bit of gamesmanship you're not
trying<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.300> show<00:02:17.390> her

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
trying to show her

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.900 
trying to show her
you<00:02:18.230> never<00:02:18.710> know<00:02:18.800> especially<00:02:19.190> from<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> driver

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you never know especially from a driver

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.640 
you never know especially from a driver
standpoint<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.570> mean<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:21.110> been<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
standpoint I mean that's been the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.460 
standpoint I mean that's been the
tendency<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.820> test<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.510> past<00:02:23.780> but

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
tendency at this test in the past but

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.290 
tendency at this test in the past but
you<00:02:24.620> know<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.890> series<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.790> on

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
you know the series really is on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.900 
you know the series really is on
everybody<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.930> push<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:28.280> they<00:02:28.430> don't<00:02:28.580> push

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
everybody to push and if they don't push

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.700 
everybody to push and if they don't push
too<00:02:29.180> many<00:02:29.480> penalties<00:02:29.660> involved<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.470> think

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
too many penalties involved and I think

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.630 
too many penalties involved and I think
they're<00:02:30.860> doing<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.130> lot<00:02:31.220> better<00:02:31.280> job<00:02:31.580> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
they're doing a lot better job of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.180 
they're doing a lot better job of
watching<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:33.260> mean<00:02:33.620> from<00:02:33.770> my<00:02:33.920> standpoint

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
watching that I mean from my standpoint

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.830 
watching that I mean from my standpoint
I<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.490> pushing<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.000> know<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.510> know<00:02:35.540> we're

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
pushing so it would be interesting to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.100 
pushing so it would be interesting to
see<00:02:37.790> how<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.030> plays<00:02:38.090> out<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.510> mean<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.870> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
see how it all plays out I mean we I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.620 
see how it all plays out I mean we I
also<00:02:39.560> wonder<00:02:40.160> what's<00:02:40.670> going<00:02:40.880> on<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.300> know<00:02:41.420> but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.900 
also wonder what's going on you know but
I<00:02:41.660> mean<00:02:41.840> that's<00:02:42.530> why<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:42.740> say<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.100> know<00:02:43.340> being

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
I mean that's why I say you know being

I mean that's why I say you know being
on<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> top<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.270> charts<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:45.170> only<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.500> test

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
on the top of charts it's only a test

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.050 
on the top of charts it's only a test
it's<00:02:46.010> only<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.280> first<00:02:46.430> day<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.850> season

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
charts you know so I think it's a good

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.160 
charts you know so I think it's a good
start<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.850> know<00:02:52.910> what<00:02:53.210> we're<00:02:53.450> doing<00:02:53.660> from<00:02:53.960> our

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
start I know what we're doing from our
