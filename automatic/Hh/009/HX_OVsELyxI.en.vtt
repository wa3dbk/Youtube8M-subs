glazing is is just to take a whole area
of<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.820> miniature<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.630> case<00:01:36.840> I'm

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
of the miniature and in this case I'm

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.810 
of the miniature and in this case I'm
taking<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.380> shoulder<00:01:37.800> pad<00:01:38.040> which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
taking this shoulder pad which is a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.000 
taking this shoulder pad which is a
green<00:01:39.090> color<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.690> I'm<00:01:39.840> using<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.140> blue<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
green color and I'm using a blue just so

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
green color and I'm using a blue just so
you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.550> what<00:01:42.020> everything<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:44.030> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you can see what everything is and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.039 
you can see what everything is and
you're<00:01:45.150> gonna<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.600> color

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
you're gonna take your color

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.109 
you're gonna take your color
you're<00:01:48.049> gonna<00:01:48.140> come<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.759> you're<00:01:50.030> gonna

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
you're gonna come in and you're gonna

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.590 
you're gonna come in and you're gonna
cover<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.659> whole<00:01:51.079> area<00:01:51.649> with<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.189> glaze

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
cover that whole area with the glaze

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.480 
cover that whole area with the glaze
what<00:01:53.600> this<00:01:53.780> can<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.229> this<00:01:54.499> tints<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.280> whole

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
what this can do is this tints the whole

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:11.309 
what this can do is this tints the whole
area<00:01:56.090> with<00:01:56.299> color<00:01:56.539> so<00:01:57.289> let's<00:01:57.500> try<00:01:57.890> this

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.420 

you're<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.739> gonna<00:02:11.890> want<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.159> push

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
you're just gonna want to push

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.209 
you're just gonna want to push
everything<00:02:12.969> around<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.019> nice<00:02:14.260> uniform

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
everything around so it's a nice uniform

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:31.180 
everything around so it's a nice uniform
layer

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.750 

pretty<00:02:32.190> much<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.569> that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.360 

so<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.599> see<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:39.200> shoulder<00:02:39.920> pad<00:02:40.220> is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
so you can see that this shoulder pad is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.690 
so you can see that this shoulder pad is
no<00:02:40.550> darker<00:02:41.060> now<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.099> essentially

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
no darker now that is essentially

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.490 
no darker now that is essentially
glazing<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.659> do<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:44.959> many<00:02:45.110> times<00:02:45.230> as

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
glazing you can do it as many times as

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.940 
glazing you can do it as many times as
you<00:02:45.650> want

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you want

00:02:46.950 --> 00:03:22.080 
you want
to<00:02:47.489> get<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.000> desired<00:02:48.540> effect<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.580> want

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.970 

and<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:23.080> we're<00:03:23.290> playing

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and because we're playing

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
and because we're playing
very<00:03:25.550> thin<00:03:26.000> paint<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:27.680> won't<00:03:27.920> take<00:03:28.160> very<00:03:28.459> long

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
very thin paint it won't take very long

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.059 
very thin paint it won't take very long
to<00:03:29.360> dry<00:03:29.599> you<00:03:30.349> actually<00:03:30.680> blow<00:03:30.830> on<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:33.069> help

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
to dry you actually blow on it to help

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:48.140 
to dry you actually blow on it to help
it<00:03:34.280> dry<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:37.040> there<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.340> have<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.870> glaze

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.209 

you
