00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.240 
fact that the defenses are now preparing
for<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> threat<00:03:12.630> just<00:03:12.960> its<00:03:13.230> threat<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.890> Robert

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
for the threat just its threat of Robert

for the threat just its threat of Robert
Griffin<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> third<00:03:15.000> running<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.050> opened

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Griffin the third running that is opened

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.590 
Griffin the third running that is opened
up<00:03:16.730> Washington's<00:03:17.730> running<00:03:18.060> game<00:03:18.210> we<00:03:18.330> talked

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
up Washington's running game we talked

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.090 
up Washington's running game we talked
about<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.230> know<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.380> couple<00:03:19.440> weeks<00:03:19.920> ago

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
about that you know a couple weeks ago

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.680 
about that you know a couple weeks ago
when<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.520> look<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:20.970> Jacksonville<00:03:21.480> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
when it look like Jacksonville is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.210 
when it look like Jacksonville is
getting<00:03:21.960> just<00:03:22.200> well<00:03:22.350> he<00:03:22.440> did<00:03:22.620> get<00:03:22.740> Blackmon

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
getting just well he did get Blackmon

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.860 
getting just well he did get Blackmon
back<00:03:23.400> briefly<00:03:23.730> how<00:03:24.210> would<00:03:24.450> open<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
back briefly how would open up the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.750 
back briefly how would open up the
running<00:03:25.170> game<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.280> fact<00:03:26.340> that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
running game I think just the fact that

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.880 
running game I think just the fact that
grip<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.480> third<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.110> least<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.500> threat

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
grip in the third is at least a threat

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.070 
grip in the third is at least a threat
to<00:03:29.100> run<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.000> opened<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.690> running

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
to run that is opened up the running

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.030 
to run that is opened up the running
game<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.380> don't<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.770> it's<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.920> coincidence

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
game I don't think it's a coincidence

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.560 
game I don't think it's a coincidence
that<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.580> Redskins<00:03:33.000> won<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.209> game<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
that the Redskins won a game is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.600 
that the Redskins won a game is
drastically<00:03:34.260> improve<00:03:34.680> second<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.459> NFL

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
drastically improve second in the NFL

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.670 
drastically improve second in the NFL
over<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> last<00:03:36.300> five<00:03:36.540> weeks<00:03:36.780> combined<00:03:37.260> all

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
over the last five weeks combined all

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
haven't even say about the total it

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.440 
haven't even say about the total it
opened<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.040> think<00:03:41.280> 48<00:03:41.730> now<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.030> crept<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.420> to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.780 
opened I think 48 now it's crept up to
48<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.020> half<00:03:43.170> or<00:03:43.290> 49<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.950> Minnesota<00:03:44.370> despite

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
of the biggest myths in sports as you

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.240 
of the biggest myths in sports as you
can<00:04:06.780> predict<00:04:07.080> turnovers<00:04:07.650> i<00:04:07.800> think<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.130> is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
can predict turnovers i think that is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.800 
can predict turnovers i think that is

gonna make mistakes on the plus side of
the<00:04:18.959> field<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.470> all<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.130> all<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.250> think<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
the field so all in all I think the

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.670 
the field so all in all I think the
totals<00:04:21.000> tough<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.840> do<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.230> think<00:04:22.260> it's

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
totals tough but do you think it's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.800 
totals tough but do you think it's
unlikely<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.520> offenses<00:04:24.060> themselves

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
unlikely that the offenses themselves

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.570 
unlikely that the offenses themselves
will<00:04:24.990> be<00:04:25.020> very<00:04:25.440> high-scoring<00:04:25.740> my<00:04:26.280> biggest

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
will be very high-scoring my biggest

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.400 
will be very high-scoring my biggest
worry<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.880> their<00:04:27.450> offenses<00:04:27.900> given<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.260> other

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
worry is their offenses given the other

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.200 
worry is their offenses given the other
teams<00:04:28.680> often<00:04:28.890> too<00:04:29.220> short<00:04:29.460> feel<00:04:29.730> but<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.060> would

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
teams often too short feel but I would

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.420 
teams often too short feel but I would
lean<00:04:30.419> towards<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> under<00:04:31.230> alright<00:04:31.800> Joe<00:04:32.220> Duffy
