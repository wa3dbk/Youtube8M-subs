liked it a lot so this is claptrap and I
kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.710> took<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.040> Lego<00:00:23.369> break<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.970> like

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
kind of took like a Lego break for like

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
kind of took like a Lego break for like
a<00:00:24.119> couple<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> months<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.900> played<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.140 
Borderlands and some people like it some
people<00:00:29.520> don't

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
people don't

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.729 
people don't
I<00:00:30.180> loved<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.860> and<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:32.580> decided<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> build<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.739> not

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
I loved it and I decided to build it not

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
I loved it and I decided to build it not
only<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> decided<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> ask<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.330> good

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
only that I decided to ask my good

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.520 
only that I decided to ask my good
friend<00:00:36.809> Sean

friend Sean
Nick<00:00:38.180> hey<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.230> build<00:00:40.410> me<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> Borderlands

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
Nick hey can you build me a Borderlands

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.299 
Nick hey can you build me a Borderlands
gun<00:00:41.400> to<00:00:41.699> go<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.330> because<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.559> didn't<00:00:44.129> tell

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
gun to go with it because I didn't tell

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.560 
gun to go with it because I didn't tell
him<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.790> away

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
him right away

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.040 
him right away
that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.890> gonna<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.250> claptrap<00:00:48.150> but<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> think

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that I was gonna do claptrap but I think

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
that I was gonna do claptrap but I think
he<00:00:49.140> knew<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.620> doing<00:00:49.860> something<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:51.030> justify

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
he knew I was doing something to justify

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.719 
he knew I was doing something to justify
that<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.580> is<00:00:53.790> pop<00:00:54.540> trap<00:00:54.839> he's<00:00:55.500> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.580> a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
that so this is pop trap he's kind of a

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.310 
that so this is pop trap he's kind of a
big<00:00:57.379> trapezoid<00:00:58.379> shape<00:00:59.059> refrigerator<00:01:00.320> this

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
big trapezoid shape refrigerator this

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
big trapezoid shape refrigerator this
actually<00:01:01.589> took<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.769> lot<00:01:01.949> longer<00:01:02.010> than<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
actually took a lot longer than it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060 
actually took a lot longer than it
should<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.690> try<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.620> angles

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
should just to try to get the angles

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.410 
should just to try to get the angles
right<00:01:05.630> like<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.440> ended<00:01:07.710> up<00:01:07.830> doing<00:01:07.890> was

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
right like what I ended up doing was

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
right like what I ended up doing was
basically<00:01:09.420> using<00:01:09.780> hinge<00:01:09.960> plates<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
basically using hinge plates and the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.080 
basically using hinge plates and the
different<00:01:11.850> types<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.650> wedge<00:01:13.650> plates<00:01:14.310> tried<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
different types of wedge plates tried to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.870 
different types of wedge plates tried to
get<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> angle<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.470> seemed<00:01:17.070> fine<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> easy

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
get the angle which seemed fine and easy

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.000 
get the angle which seemed fine and easy
at<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> time<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.720> realized<00:01:19.110> he's<00:01:19.770> got

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
at the time but then I realized he's got

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.720 
at the time but then I realized he's got
horizontal<00:01:20.760> stripes<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> back

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
horizontal stripes so to get that back

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.000 
horizontal stripes so to get that back
the<00:01:24.090> vertical<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> top<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
the vertical as well as the top of the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.960 
the vertical as well as the top of the
bottom<00:01:27.200> was<00:01:28.200> slightly<00:01:28.860> more<00:01:29.160> math<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bottom was slightly more math and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
bottom was slightly more math and
thought<00:01:30.300> that<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.960> anticipated<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:32.010> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
thought that I had anticipated when I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.150 
thought that I had anticipated when I
first<00:01:32.280> started<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:33.530> similarly<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.890> wheel<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
first started it similarly the wheel I

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.510 
first started it similarly the wheel I
wasn't<00:01:35.730> really<00:01:35.910> sure<00:01:36.120> how<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
wasn't really sure how to do that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.620 
wasn't really sure how to do that
originally<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.880> scales<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.510> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
originally one of the scales I want to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.890 
originally one of the scales I want to
do<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.870> or<00:01:40.290> thought<00:01:40.500> about<00:01:40.710> doing<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.550> more

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
do it or thought about doing it was more

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.960 
do it or thought about doing it was more
like<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> tumbler<00:01:44.369> wheel<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like with a tumbler wheel or like a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.160 
like with a tumbler wheel or like a
large<00:01:45.210> Lego<00:01:45.509> actual<00:01:46.170> wheel<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.180> wanted<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
large Lego actual wheel but I wanted it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.940 
large Lego actual wheel but I wanted it
as<00:01:49.350> big<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.770> could<00:01:49.830> possibly<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
as big as I could possibly get it so I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.370 
as big as I could possibly get it so I
went<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> couple<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
went and then like a couple of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.380 
went and then like a couple of
iterations<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.610> wheel<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.560> built<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> up

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
iterations of the wheel and built it up

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.749 
iterations of the wheel and built it up
the<00:02:00.390> wheel<00:02:00.750> inside<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.770> almost<00:02:02.070> entirely

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the wheel inside is almost entirely

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
the wheel inside is almost entirely
solid<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.710> weight<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
solid because of the weight and the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.680 
solid because of the weight and the
stuff<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.439> even<00:02:07.970> though<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
stuff it there's even though it's it's a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.229 
stuff it there's even though it's it's a
relatively<00:02:10.229> thin<00:02:11.039> panel<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:12.030> there

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
relatively thin panel that's on there

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.199 
relatively thin panel that's on there
that's<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> very<00:02:12.750> big<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.260> heavy<00:02:13.290> panel<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.459> I

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
that's a very big and heavy panel and I

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.550 
that's a very big and heavy panel and I
had<00:02:15.360> problems<00:02:15.600> where<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.530> actually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
had problems where it would actually

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130 
had problems where it would actually
start<00:02:17.160> twisting<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.760> breaking<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
start twisting and breaking so I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.940 
start twisting and breaking so I
reinforced<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.220> bottom<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.390> wheel<00:02:21.950> just

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
reinforced the bottom of the wheel just

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.490 
reinforced the bottom of the wheel just
so<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.580> he's<00:02:24.510> relatively<00:02:25.230> stable<00:02:26.060> inside

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
so that he's relatively stable inside

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
so that he's relatively stable inside
what's<00:02:28.500> above<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> wheel<00:02:29.549> in<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> main<00:02:30.030> part

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
what's above the wheel in the main part

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.789 
what's above the wheel in the main part
of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> build<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> structure<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.650> in

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
of the build with the structure like in

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.350 
of the build with the structure like in
there<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.040> keep<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.220> all<00:02:32.310> together<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:33.239> could

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
there to keep it all together you could

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.150 
there to keep it all together you could
actually<00:02:33.540> take<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> look<00:02:34.110> at<00:02:34.290> behind<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.950> back

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
actually take a look at behind the back

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
actually take a look at behind the back
I<00:02:35.370> left<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.700> open<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.090> people<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.720> but

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I left it open so people can see but

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.320 
I left it open so people can see but
it's<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.830> thin<00:02:38.900> cube<00:02:39.900> frame<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:41.330> actually

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
it's a very thin cube frame I actually

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's a very thin cube frame I actually
stole<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.049> idea<00:02:43.200> from<00:02:43.380> Forest<00:02:43.980> King<00:02:44.280> when<00:02:44.610> he

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
stole the idea from Forest King when he

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.509 
stole the idea from Forest King when he
did<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.630> when<00:02:46.230> he<00:02:46.319> designed<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.950> cubes<00:02:47.250> for

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
did the when he designed the cubes for

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.490 
did the when he designed the cubes for
bro<00:02:47.820> logs<00:02:48.090> cyber<00:02:48.630> city<00:02:48.900> display

bro logs cyber city display

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.880 
bro logs cyber city display
it's<00:02:49.799> basically<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> 32<00:02:51.060> slightly<00:02:51.989> modified<00:02:52.470> 32

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
it's basically a 32 slightly modified 32

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.180 
it's basically a 32 slightly modified 32
by<00:02:53.250> 32<00:02:53.930> frame<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.200> completely<00:02:55.560> flops<00:02:56.010> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
by 32 frame that completely flops is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.310 
by 32 frame that completely flops is
down<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.390> attachment<00:02:57.930> points<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
down and there is attachment points to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.640 
down and there is attachment points to
basically<00:02:58.680> hang<00:02:59.130> the<00:03:00.120> panels<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.530> that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
basically hang the panels on to that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.069 
basically hang the panels on to that
frame<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:03.000> slightly<00:03:03.299> wobbly<00:03:03.720> but

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
frame so it's slightly wobbly but

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.830 
frame so it's slightly wobbly but
super-strong<00:03:04.970> without<00:03:05.970> having<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.359> build<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
super-strong without having to build it

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.430 
super-strong without having to build it
entirely<00:03:07.230> solid<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.519> pack<00:03:08.730> down

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
entirely solid so this can pack down

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.599 
entirely solid so this can pack down
relatively<00:03:10.440> small<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.010> one<00:03:11.280> banker

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
relatively small it's like one banker

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.500 
relatively small it's like one banker
box<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.799> some<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.850> panel's<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.420> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
box and some the panel's going to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.590 
box and some the panel's going to
another<00:03:15.660> box<00:03:16.549> very<00:03:17.549> nice<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.480> last

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
another box very nice and one last

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.390 
another box very nice and one last
detail<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.019> noticed<00:03:19.410> here<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.890> pick<00:03:20.370> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
detail I noticed here is this a pick a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.830 
detail I noticed here is this a pick a
brick<00:03:20.609> lid<00:03:20.880> you've<00:03:21.090> got<00:03:21.269> for<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.540> an<00:03:21.690> ally

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
brick lid you've got for like an ally

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
brick lid you've got for like an ally
almost<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.350> front<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.340> pick<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> brick

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
almost on the front it is a pick a brick

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.729 
almost on the front it is a pick a brick
lid<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.570> basically<00:03:25.290> went<00:03:25.470> through<00:03:25.560> my

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
lid I basically went through my

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.750 
lid I basically went through my
collection<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.220> big<00:03:26.459> circle<00:03:26.819> II<00:03:26.910> things<00:03:27.209> and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
collection of big circle II things and

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.330 
collection of big circle II things and
just<00:03:29.930> cannot<00:03:30.930> find<00:03:31.230> anything<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.160> right

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
just cannot find anything the right

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.039 
just cannot find anything the right
scale<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:33.600> do<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.959> right<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:36.299> think<00:03:36.450> someone

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
scale to do it right and I think someone

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.800 
scale to do it right and I think someone
actually<00:03:37.260> jokingly<00:03:38.160> suggested<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.720> I

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
actually jokingly suggested it like I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.319 
actually jokingly suggested it like I
put<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.139> on<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.590> started<00:03:40.859> looking<00:03:41.609> at<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.819> I'm<00:03:42.150> I

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
put it on I started looking at it I'm I

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.960 
put it on I started looking at it I'm I
that<00:03:43.319> actually<00:03:43.769> really<00:03:44.130> really<00:03:44.519> works<00:03:44.730> that

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
that actually really really works that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.640 
that actually really really works that
actually<00:03:45.389> had<00:03:45.510> problems<00:03:45.660> figure<00:03:46.049> out<00:03:46.139> how<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
actually had problems figure out how it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.450 
actually had problems figure out how it
even<00:03:46.769> attached<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
even attached it

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.760 
even attached it
I<00:03:48.520> actually<00:03:48.930> happened<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:49.990> be<00:03:50.080> talking<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.530> Ian

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
I actually happened to be talking to Ian

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.470 
I actually happened to be talking to Ian
spate<00:03:51.100> check<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.550> time<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.970> he<00:03:52.240> was<00:03:52.390> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
spate check at the time and he was the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.240 
spate check at the time and he was the
one<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.900> actually<00:03:53.020> suggested<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.740> final

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
one that actually suggested the final

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.930 
one that actually suggested the final
assembly<00:03:54.550> which<00:03:55.210> is<00:03:55.360> almost<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.750> friction

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
assembly which is almost like friction

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.490 
assembly which is almost like friction
attached<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:59.410> such<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:01.480> cool<00:04:01.930> thanks<00:04:02.350> for
