okay series for a majority of the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
okay series for a majority of the
episode<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.869> an<00:00:27.990> average<00:00:28.410> series

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
episode it was like an average series

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.279

then<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> ending<00:00:30.119> happened<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> they

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
then the ending happened and they

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.139 
then the ending happened and they
completely<00:00:31.800> threw<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.579> loop<00:00:32.610> because

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
completely threw me for a loop because

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
completely threw me for a loop because
I'm<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:36.469> it<00:00:37.469> took<00:00:37.800> me<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> moment<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.489> realize

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I'm like it took me a moment to realize

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
I'm like it took me a moment to realize
what<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> hell<00:00:40.230> happened<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> look<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.700> at

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the episode and I realized that this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.100 
the episode and I realized that this
series<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.940> dealing<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
supposedly looks like it's going to be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.400 
supposedly looks like it's going to be
dealing<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.570> travel<00:00:48.840> time

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
manipulation stuff like that and from

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.670 
manipulation stuff like that and from
what<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.660> from<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.110> ending<00:00:52.410> part<00:00:52.559> of

hidden<00:01:36.570> gem<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.170> anime<00:01:37.500> season<00:01:37.860> this

is why pacifically I will say it's a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.330 
is why pacifically I will say it's a
hidden<00:01:40.380> gem<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> animation

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
hidden gem is because the animation

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
hidden gem is because the animation
let's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.909> lie<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.420> let's<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:46.079> honest

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
with each other and not lie the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.530 
with each other and not lie the
animation<00:01:48.840> honestly<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
animation honestly it's not that good I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.200 
animation honestly it's not that good I
mean<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.200> times<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.340> episode<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> thought

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
mean at times in this episode I thought

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.999 
mean at times in this episode I thought
the<00:01:54.420> animation<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.200> lagging<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the animation was lagging like the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.160 
the animation was lagging like the
frames<00:01:56.280> per<00:01:56.490> second<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> frames<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
frames per second and the frames I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.840 
frames per second and the frames I
thought<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.829> was<00:01:58.920> lagging<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.729> was

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
thought it was lagging when I was

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.550 
thought it was lagging when I was
watching<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> episode<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.170> stopped

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
watching this episode I actually stopped

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.660 
watching this episode I actually stopped
my<00:02:01.680> episode<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> couple<00:02:02.219> times<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:02.640> sure

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
my episode a couple times to make sure

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.069 
my episode a couple times to make sure
if<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.000> lagging<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> way

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
if it was lagging or not because the way

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.980 
if it was lagging or not because the way
the<00:02:04.200> characters<00:02:04.560> moved<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.310> felt<00:02:05.670> very

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the characters moved it just felt very

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.300 
the characters moved it just felt very
unrealistic<00:02:06.990> at<00:02:07.350> times<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> mean<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> way

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
unrealistic at times and I mean the way

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
unrealistic at times and I mean the way
the<00:02:08.459> characters<00:02:08.789> faces<00:02:09.149> looked<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.479> times<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the characters faces looked at times it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.089 
the characters faces looked at times it
looked<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.860> weird

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
looked like it was going into a weird

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
looked like it was going into a weird
CGI<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
CGI just it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
CGI just it
not<00:02:12.959> look<00:02:13.140> good<00:02:13.290> with<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> 2d<00:02:13.739> 3d<00:02:14.160> top<00:02:14.400> effect

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
not look good with the 2d 3d top effect

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.970 
not look good with the 2d 3d top effect
that<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> faces<00:02:15.360> were<00:02:15.480> giving<00:02:15.810> off<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.410> this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that the faces were giving off in this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.130 
that the faces were giving off in this
episode<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.300> really<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> only

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
episode but that really is the only

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.350 
episode but that really is the only
underlying<00:02:20.069> problem<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.090> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
underlying problem I see with this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.089 
underlying problem I see with this
episode<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.500> animation<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
episode it's just the animation the

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.830 
episode it's just the animation the
budget<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.580> definitely<00:02:23.790> lacking<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
budget is definitely lacking for the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
budget is definitely lacking for the
animation<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.739> as<00:02:25.950> always<00:02:26.550> usually<00:02:27.000> hidden

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
animation but as always usually hidden

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.229 
animation but as always usually hidden
gems<00:02:27.690> always<00:02:28.380> focus<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.010> animation<00:02:30.000> for

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
gems always focus on the animation for

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.880 
gems always focus on the animation for
instance<00:02:30.540> these<00:02:30.660> anime<00:02:31.080> always<00:02:31.410> get<00:02:31.590> skipped

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
instance these anime always get skipped

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.009 
instance these anime always get skipped
over<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.610> animation<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
over because the animation is not the

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.540 
over because the animation is not the
best<00:02:34.290> especially<00:02:34.620> after<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.099> watch<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> series

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
best especially after you watch a series

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.860 
best especially after you watch a series
like<00:02:35.610> feign<00:02:35.849> today<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:36.720> this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
like feign today not you go into this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
like feign today not you go into this
series<00:02:37.230> you'll<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.860> oh<00:02:37.980> my<00:02:38.160> god

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
series you'll be like oh my god

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.870 
series you'll be like oh my god
but<00:02:39.120> overall<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.380> episode<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:41.160> very<00:02:41.459> good<00:02:41.730> now

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
but overall the episode is very good now

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880 
but overall the episode is very good now

has<00:03:09.150> something<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.599> with<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.840> guess<00:03:09.930> time

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
has something to do with I guess time

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.449 
has something to do with I guess time
manipulation<00:03:10.650> or<00:03:10.860> whatever

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
manipulation or whatever

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.130 
manipulation or whatever
Nagisa<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.269> her<00:03:12.330> name<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.630> she<00:03:13.049> has

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
Nagisa I think her name is she has

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.300 
Nagisa I think her name is she has
something<00:03:13.380> going<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> time

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
something going on with the time

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.729 
something going on with the time
manipulation<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.360> when<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.140> saw<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.349> girl

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
manipulation and when you saw that girl

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.710 
manipulation and when you saw that girl
come<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.310> fall<00:03:17.579> up<00:03:17.760> above<00:03:18.120> stairs<00:03:18.420> I'm

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
come and fall up above stairs I'm

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.330 
come and fall up above stairs I'm
guessing<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.109> was<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.290> time<00:03:19.590> quake<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.070> girl

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
guessing that was a time quake this girl

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.580 
guessing that was a time quake this girl
that<00:03:20.549> came<00:03:20.730> back<00:03:21.000> most<00:03:21.600> likely<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:22.109> trying<00:03:22.410> to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
that came back most likely is trying to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.170 
that came back most likely is trying to
rewrite<00:03:22.950> history<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.459> stop<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:23.880> guessing

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
rewrite history and stop I'm guessing

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.729 
rewrite history and stop I'm guessing
the<00:03:24.269> main<00:03:24.390> female<00:03:24.600> character<00:03:25.079> from<00:03:25.320> dying

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the main female character from dying

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.009 
the main female character from dying
that's<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.820> think<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.239> going<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.660> here<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
that's what I think is going on here I

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:28.940 
that's what I think is going on here I
think<00:03:28.260> we're<00:03:28.380> playing<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.709> time

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
think we're playing with a time

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.430 
think we're playing with a time
manipulation<00:03:29.430> type<00:03:29.760> anime<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.480> there's<00:03:31.140> one

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
manipulation type anime so there's one

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.930 
manipulation type anime so there's one
thing<00:03:31.650> about<00:03:31.709> these<00:03:32.010> type<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.400> series<00:03:32.640> that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
thing about these type of series that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.670 
thing about these type of series that
could<00:03:33.120> either<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.420> good<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.780> bad<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.440> very

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
could either be good or bad it's very

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.520 
could either be good or bad it's very
hard<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.160> make<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.459> good<00:03:35.819> time<00:03:36.690> travel<00:03:37.260> or<00:03:37.350> time

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
hard to make a good time travel or time

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.069 
hard to make a good time travel or time
manipulation<00:03:38.010> type<00:03:38.489> series<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.840> is

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
manipulation type series it really is

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.289 
manipulation type series it really is
hard<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.680> make<00:03:40.829> these<00:03:40.980> type<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.340> series<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:41.790> so

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
hard to make these type of series and so

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.660 
hard to make these type of series and so
it<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.540> easily<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:43.200> ruined<00:03:43.799> depending<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.459> how

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it can easily be ruined depending on how

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.819 
it can easily be ruined depending on how
