00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
that all of my folders are in now it's

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
that all of my folders are in now it's
pretty<00:01:22.439> simple<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.820> trick<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> work

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
pretty simple to get this trick to work

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
pretty simple to get this trick to work
but<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.070> bit

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but it can be a little bit

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.840 
but it can be a little bit
time-consuming<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:28.460> like<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> first

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
time-consuming because like the first

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
time-consuming because like the first
couple<00:01:30.479> times<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> try<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
couple times that you try it it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.630 
couple times that you try it it's
basically<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> coordination<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:34.640> iOS

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
basically like a coordination thing iOS

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
basically like a coordination thing iOS
has<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.630> bug<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.310> Apple<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.570> had

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
has a bug in it that Apple you know had

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
has a bug in it that Apple you know had
forgot<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> fix<00:01:40.890> basically<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.759> come

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
forgot to fix basically when they come

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.469 
forgot to fix basically when they come
out<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.150> iOS<00:01:42.600> 8<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.939> Apple<00:01:44.939> still<00:01:45.149> has<00:01:45.299> not

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
out with iOS 8 and Apple still has not

perfect<00:03:48.680> timing<00:03:48.949> in<00:03:49.310> between<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.790> folders

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
perfect timing in between that folders

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.460 
perfect timing in between that folders
shutting<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.780> you're<00:03:50.930> reaching<00:03:51.109> up<00:03:51.349> and

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
dragging that other app to where this

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.599 
dragging that other app to where this
folder<00:03:54.049> opens<00:03:54.470> again<00:03:54.739> it's<00:03:54.949> basically<00:03:55.340> like

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
folder opens again it's basically like

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.699 
folder opens again it's basically like
you're<00:03:55.759> kind<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.030> tricking<00:03:56.479> it<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:56.870> then<00:03:57.500> once

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
you're kind of tricking it and then once

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.110 
you're kind of tricking it and then once
it's<00:03:57.919> in<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.220> folder<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.639> can<00:03:58.759> move<00:03:59.000> it

to<00:05:14.920> kind<00:05:15.280> of<00:05:15.340> trick<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:17.580> see<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.820> didn't<00:05:19.360> get<00:05:19.480> at

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
to kind of trick it see I didn't get at

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.170 
to kind of trick it see I didn't get at
that<00:05:19.720> time<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.140> missed<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.740> missed<00:05:20.890> it<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:21.940> it's

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
that time I missed I missed it so it's

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.050 
that time I missed I missed it so it's
going<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.360> take<00:05:22.630> a<00:05:22.960> few<00:05:23.770> tries<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.370> get<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.640> and

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
going to take a few tries to get it and

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.240 
going to take a few tries to get it and
eventually<00:05:25.720> after<00:05:25.900> doing<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.650> while<00:05:26.680> it's

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
eventually after doing it a while it's

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.800 
eventually after doing it a while it's
just<00:05:27.370> gonna<00:05:27.580> be<00:05:27.760> like<00:05:27.910> anything<00:05:28.150> else<00:05:28.480> you'll

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.590 
just gonna be like anything else you'll
eventually<00:05:29.050> start<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.530> get<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.890> hang<00:05:30.070> of<00:05:30.220> it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
eventually start to get the hang of it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.410 
eventually start to get the hang of it
and<00:05:31.680> see<00:05:32.680> how<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:32.980> did<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.220> now<00:05:34.030> see<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.240> missed

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
and see how it did it now see I missed

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.390 
and see how it did it now see I missed
at<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.900> time<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.140> let<00:05:35.410> go<00:05:35.560> of<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.830> to<00:05:35.980> surance

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
at that time I let go of it to surance

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.010 
at that time I let go of it to surance
too<00:05:36.670> soon<00:05:36.910> so<00:05:37.150> it<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:37.420> went<00:05:37.540> right<00:05:37.750> back<00:05:37.840> on

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
too soon so it just went right back on

because you have to be able to click in
one<00:06:15.190> continuous<00:06:15.760> spot<00:06:16.270> without<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.780> app

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
one continuous spot without the app

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.210 
one continuous spot without the app
moving<00:06:17.440> without<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.700> folder<00:06:18.970> moving<00:06:19.300> and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
moving without the folder moving and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.379 
moving without the folder moving and
when<00:06:21.220> you<00:06:21.370> have<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:21.729> up<00:06:21.880> here<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.270> you're

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
when you have it up here and you're

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.629 
when you have it up here and you're
trying<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.750> do<00:06:22.930> that<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.860> will<00:06:24.130> continuously

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
trying to do that it will continuously

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.360 
trying to do that it will continuously
move<00:06:25.180> over<00:06:25.540> as<00:06:25.720> you<00:06:25.900> drag<00:06:26.169> folders<00:06:26.590> into<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.160> so

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
move over as you drag folders into it so

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.550 
move over as you drag folders into it so
it<00:06:27.520> kind<00:06:27.760> of<00:06:27.850> gets<00:06:28.030> a<00:06:28.120> bit<00:06:28.300> hectic<00:06:28.540> and<00:06:28.960> it<00:06:29.080> gets

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
it kind of gets a bit hectic and it gets

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.080 
it kind of gets a bit hectic and it gets
very<00:06:29.650> hard<00:06:30.040> for<00:06:30.190> you<00:06:30.310> to<00:06:30.340> get<00:06:30.550> that<00:06:30.700> rhythm

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
very hard for you to get that rhythm

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.570 
very hard for you to get that rhythm
down<00:06:31.270> so<00:06:32.169> it's<00:06:32.410> easier<00:06:32.800> if<00:06:32.919> you<00:06:33.040> just<00:06:33.280> put<00:06:33.490> it

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
down so it's easier if you just put it

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.550 
down so it's easier if you just put it
down<00:06:33.729> here<00:06:33.790> and<00:06:34.240> then<00:06:34.330> move<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.110> back<00:06:35.260> up<00:06:35.410> when

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
down here and then move it back up when

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.719 
down here and then move it back up when
you're<00:06:35.710> done<00:06:35.889> and<00:06:36.010> then<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.220> can<00:06:36.370> click<00:06:36.580> that

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
you're done and then you can click that

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.280 
you're done and then you can click that
and<00:06:36.790> there<00:06:37.090> you<00:06:37.180> go<00:06:37.300> your<00:06:37.510> folder<00:06:37.810> is<00:06:37.840> there<00:06:38.139> on
