those see where the hard drive bay is
it's<00:00:25.199> no<00:00:25.380> longer<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.800> shiny<00:00:26.189> finish<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.880> could

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it's no longer a shiny finish it could

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
it's no longer a shiny finish it could
be<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> matte<00:00:27.689> black<00:00:28.080> plastic<00:00:28.470> finish<00:00:28.949> there

which<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.449> think<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> makes<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
which I like I think it makes the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.420 
which I like I think it makes the
console<00:00:31.380> actually<00:00:31.679> look<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> hell<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.279> lot

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
console actually look a hell of a lot

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
console actually look a hell of a lot
better<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> gets<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.840> changes<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
better but it gets the changes the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
better but it gets the changes the
revisions<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.610> even<00:00:35.880> bigger<00:00:36.059> than<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
revisions get even bigger than that the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680 
revisions get even bigger than that the
system<00:00:37.680> buttons<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> eject<00:00:38.700> button<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.540> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
can't expect that yet it's still

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
can't expect that yet it's still
relatively<00:01:05.670> early<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> eighth

generation they're not going to do price
cuts<00:01:08.580> yet<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.210> Microsoft<00:01:10.110> did<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.439> Sony

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
cuts yet well Microsoft did but Sony

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
cuts yet well Microsoft did but Sony
doesn't<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.420> didn't

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
doesn't have to and I just just didn't

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.469 
doesn't have to and I just just didn't
expect<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.320> anyway<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
expect it anyway so I think this is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
expect it anyway so I think this is
smart<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.140> glad<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.680> made<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.100> changes

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
smart I'm glad they made these changes

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
smart I'm glad they made these changes
to<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> PlayStation<00:01:18.420> 4<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.900> hate<00:01:19.200> shiny

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to the PlayStation 4 I hate shiny

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
to the PlayStation 4 I hate shiny
plastic<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.400> hate<00:01:20.939> touch<00:01:21.479> sensitive<00:01:22.049> buttons

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
plastic I hate touch sensitive buttons

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
plastic I hate touch sensitive buttons
and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.610> smart<00:01:24.210> good

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and I think these are smart good

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
and I think these are smart good
revisions<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.740> lower<00:01:26.280> power

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
revisions and the lower power

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
revisions and the lower power
consumption<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.479> always<00:01:27.810> expect<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
consumption that's always expect that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
consumption that's always expect that
they're<00:01:28.500> always<00:01:28.650> constantly<00:01:29.310> working<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> cut

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
they're always constantly working to cut

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
they're always constantly working to cut
costs<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> console<00:01:32.040> more

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
costs and and make the console more

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
costs and and make the console more
power<00:01:32.460> efficient<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
power efficient and I think this is a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.539 
power efficient and I think this is a
good<00:01:34.680> revision<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.520> thinking

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
good revision so if you're thinking

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.460 
good revision so if you're thinking
about<00:01:35.790> getting<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.180> playstation<00:01:36.720> 4<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
playstation 4 model i don't think these

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
playstation 4 model i don't think these
are<00:01:43.229> cuts<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> lower<00:01:44.549> costs<00:01:45.119> obviously<00:01:45.570> they

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
are cuts to lower costs obviously they

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.120 
are cuts to lower costs obviously they
are<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.380> saying<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
are but I'm saying I don't think this is

are but I'm saying I don't think this is
making<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> playstation<00:01:48.240> 4<00:01:48.420> crappier<00:01:48.899> I

making the playstation 4 crappier I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
making the playstation 4 crappier I
think<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.740> making<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> more<00:01:50.280> practical

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
think it's making it more practical

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
think it's making it more practical
making<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> better<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.810> honest<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
