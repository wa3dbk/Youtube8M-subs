00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 boys live but also died this 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.889
 aimed at assisting me with the subject 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.679
 of this video is the witcher 3 gdr that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.199
 will be released relatively soon by 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 which we know practically all this already 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.970
 title in fact protagonist every day 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 of gameplay news previews stuff stuff 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.279
 other examples similar to the last effort 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.189
 some guys from cd projekt red could 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.140
 obviously be the annual titles like 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 for example call of duty and assassin's 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 creed but also watchdog and in general e 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 more or less all the titles triple a con 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.590
 a business literally done with i 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.149
 counter-creeps counter-trend instead yes 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.579
 can say that the work of rockstar games 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.800
 they have a lot to teach in this regard 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 the US development house indeed 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.539
 chosen to implement a policy 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.180
 decidedly based on the release of 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.420
 some information with the dropper 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.129
 trailer some pictures some 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 information of everything to elevate 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.229
 naturally live of gamers a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.479
 another speech that goes in this direction and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.310
 early access to beta 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.380
 if you are a PC player 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 obviously used steam you will know 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.420
 almost all very well there is one 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 dedicated section completely 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 early access to video games on 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.479
 which isn't even bad if it wasn't 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.970
 that we often find ourselves in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 pay to shell out to find a title 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.200
 which has not yet come out is still underway 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 of development and very probably indeed 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 surely it will be full of problems 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.259
 obviously this is a move of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.990
 marketing implemented by the developers of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.939
 video games that fully exploit 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.250
 the wave of hype towards a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.259
 title in short, so to speak if not there 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.149
 were all this expectation in the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.100
 against a video game one does not 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 would never dream of paying to log on 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.040
 to the beta especially considering that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.159
 many times the games are not even 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 concluded at this point the question arises 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.729
 spontaneous was better before 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.189
 or is it better now let me explain better in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.009
 past of course life was there was 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.619
 obviously present however the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.870
 information that leaked from the few 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.340
 trade magazines and above all from 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.879
 for net that was almost completely 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.250
 absent made the player do it 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.200
 created a kind of expectation that not 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.790
 went beyond what it was 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.769
 actually the video game 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.640
 let's say the real hype 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.959
 then it was created by word of mouth 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.329
 following the release of the video game 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.879
 while currently in the present live 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.069
 is literally made to explode at 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.930
 due to the very high flow of 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.610
 information that comes out above all 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.799
 before the release of the video game 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.680
 however in this sense there is one to do 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.420
 a consideration would be hypocritical not 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.700
 talk is obvious with all these 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.799
 information with all this criticality 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.450
 more often than not we find ourselves ad 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.209
 buy a title that is almost there 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.730
 one hundred percent sure we will like it 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 despite the expectations created 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 from the hype of various gameplay from everything 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.379
 how they do not reflect at all 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.480
 reality watchdog already is also also 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.180
 interesting to analyze the appearance of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.099
 discrepancy between triple and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.750
 games a little more niche like 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.669
 may be the indices on which 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.130
 practically impossible to find 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.859
 information in the various search engines 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.919
 in short, the real masters of 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.379
 google are always and in any case the titles 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.730
 triple a so light is created only 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.680
 in that sense 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.709
 in short, we live in an age in which hiv 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.780
 it's literally the gasoline on the fire 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.940
 of expectations towards a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.250
 videogame but more often than not 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.800
 does not fully reflect our 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.000
 expectations does not fully reflect i 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.709
 our wishes 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.890
 you who say you are for or against 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.840
 this disproportionate aips these hyperbole 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.930
 that always does so 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.390
 and then drops in short prefer the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.190
 surprise factor or prefer e 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.739
 know everything about a video game 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.600
 before the guys come out of course 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.549
 as usual let me know below in the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.069
