when it goes down to 0 or when it goes
up<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> 100<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.830> knows<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.220> recognized<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
up to 100 it knows it's recognized it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
up to 100 it knows it's recognized it
and<00:01:27.000> our<00:01:27.240> Zed<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> throttle<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> set

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and our Zed is the throttle so you set

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.230 
and our Zed is the throttle so you set
that<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> throttle<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.320> brake<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:32.280> why<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that to throttle and brake is why so you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870 
that to throttle and brake is why so you
set<00:01:33.540> Y<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.750> brake<00:01:34.220> when<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
set Y to brake when you first get it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.920 
set Y to brake when you first get it
they'll<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.329> none<00:01:36.600> clutch<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.780> as

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
they'll be on none clutch is the same as

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.920 
they'll be on none clutch is the same as
brake<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:41.090> don't<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.240> why<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> could

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
brake for me I don't know why you could

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.639 
brake for me I don't know why you could
it<00:01:43.020> reverse<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.649> probably<00:01:43.890> why<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
it reverse that's probably why and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.740 
it reverse that's probably why and
steering<00:01:46.649> left

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
steering left

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
steering left
so<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.079> steering<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:49.950> 100<00:01:50.399> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
so that's steering so when it's 100 it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
so that's steering so when it's 100 it's
all<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> way<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> right<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.720> 50

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
all the way on the right when it's on 50

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.090 
all the way on the right when it's on 50
it's<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> middle<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.470> then

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's in the middle and so on and then

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
it's in the middle and so on and then
all<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.520> others<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.210> things<00:01:57.899> even

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
all these others are like things even

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
all these others are like things even
have<00:01:58.469> press<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.189> whatever<00:01:59.340> undis<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> button

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have press and whatever undis a button

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.670 
have press and whatever undis a button
so<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:01.350> go<00:02:01.500> over<00:02:01.590> to
