00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.340
 hello how about you talk price welcome 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.130
 to a new video this time 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.320
 I bring the crepe and my parents were 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.220
 surgeons and I usually talk to the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.810
 furniture 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.340
 I hope it is sacred 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.990
 agree that I am always 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.210
 receiving your personal experiences 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.720
 so they do not stop sending them 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.990
 agreement 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.990
 very good without saying more let's start 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.530
 my parents were surgeons and I used to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.330
 talk to the furniture 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.070
 cristian a neighborhood where 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.200
 properties were so large and the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.500
 so wealthy families who built 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.460
 Huge mansions and walls around 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.340
 locking themselves in their own paradises 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.619
 secrets never interacting with their 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.480
 neighbors more than for some strange 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.180
 coincidence 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.130
 I was educated at home until the age of 7 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.979
 years that's when this story ends 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.560
 but first this starts when I had 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.170
 4 the time when I hardly have 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.450
 memories and how was my childhood 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.640
 as a child I thought to stay 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.770
 locked up all the time at home was what 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.020
 that all children did 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.479
 every time my parents went to them 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.000
 I asked if I could go with them but 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.920
 they always refused explaining that only 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 adults can leave home and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.369
 exclusively in very serious emergencies 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.160
 apart from that desire he never asked 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.950
 toys or stuff like that so 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.420
 I developed what my parents said was 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 a very creative imagination 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.410
 I started forming relationships with the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.270
 furniture of my house spending days 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.319
 complete chatting with them and 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.319
 naming them all 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.450
 parents seemed to unleash on me 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 creativity adding more and more 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 furniture to the house in an exaggerated way 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.510
 my father considered himself a very man 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.040
 skillful with the tools and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.860
 He often expressed his passion for 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.300
 build things in addition to how he 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.020
 had created several parts of the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.320
 furniture 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.030
 and so three years passed full of 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.850
 deep emotional relationships that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.370
 I created with the furniture of my home 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.680
 arnold on the sofa in the room that looks 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.130
 move up and down when I 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.040
 I reclined on it to read 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.130
 sofÃ­a was my bed which got me 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.650
 gently forward and behind 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.060
 done sometimes I could hear it 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.830
 gently hum 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.120
 when leaning on my head in the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.150
 desk in my room 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.150
 claudio heard throbbing is that they were going to 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.760
 rhythm with the beat of my heart used to 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.980
 talk to Teodoro a small chair that 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.950
 I was very talkative, answering 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.660
 slight moans and strange vibrations and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.970
 even the ones and spontaneously without him 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.570
 speak 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.590
 but above all he loved gladys the most 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.690
 big and comfortable zuffa in the house 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 all the furniture felt so soft 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.890
 warm and alive for me 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.870
 it's strange how things can change 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.379
 so fast 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.599
 It was a Monday my seventh birthday my 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.470
 parents were in their workshop building 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.600
 a new piece of furniture as my gift 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.820
 a woman had gotten lost driving 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.310
 through the city and although our doors 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.170
 they were completely closed they were 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.140
 arranged to leave 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.180
 hit the door slightly which made 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.050
 that I'm about to jump because I've never 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.390
 we receive visits 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.870
 when I saw the door the expression of his 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.549
 face changed to complete horror 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.739
 sniffed a little air and had gagging 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.739
 he took me and started running 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.940
 tomorrow I'm 27 and I have not stopped giving 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.590
 back to the question of whether or not you should 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.510
 sit in the showroom 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.430
 while my parents are executed 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.480
 the headlines in the newspapers and we 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.960
 They rated worse than cars brand 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.800
 having rebuilt 167 people 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.680
 until the day of my seventh birthday 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.830
 they were never told neighbors because nobody 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.960
 actually died however they did 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.849
 Something worse 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.699
 167 people were needed to 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.259
 make 71 pieces of furniture 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.599
 those are six hundred forty four 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.129
 members re assembled in ways that 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.199
 no healthy mind should get 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.500
 sometimes people think I'm 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.670
 buddhist 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.970
 since there is no furniture in my house 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.960
 my parents were surgeons and I used to 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.960
 talk to the furniture
