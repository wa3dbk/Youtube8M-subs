00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 update and release will also have the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.510
 way of the geday that is when what goes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.610
 there with the yoda 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.360
 but he is one of those that you have to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.729
 buy it then 99 to buy it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.190
 planet 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.640
 I did not buy also has the planet of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.910
 Bonus that's really cool you have to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.940
 Find out how you're playing and the one here. 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:39.000
 It is with 63 proea with useful art also the 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.520
 well the difference is who you go 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.910
 unlock one of the characters 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.960
 I say okay, everyone here. 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:54.270
 you will then playing for example 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.050
 quinta 30 a igual em ubud normal por 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.900
 example here is the look 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.460
 but I do not think it 's with the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.640
 power in haiti not know 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:13.100
 you saw that all this he put there and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:26.489
 You lord that destroyed the whole parade. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:27.989
 you touch him the difference is the thematic 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.930
 about the game 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.970
 for example I'm here with obvious am 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.970
 I have to be careful watching it. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.310
 all of which we have 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.160
 feature of the movie eg I 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.280
 I think it 's a geday. 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.780
 and he uses the strength to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.450
 End the crowd when you click and 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.720
 uses the very force to gallas hail of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.950
 when you finish level close with a 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.010
 symbol 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.860
 When you pass, look at the transition. 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.660
 Just like the movie they thought of everything. 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.920
 really shows that now in the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:28.160
 second planet that is the one left from death 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.160
 there it is different and it has to do with the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:39.780
 there is already the gameplay of angry birds 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:43.319
 space that already has new for us 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.060
 to experience that they want to 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.060
 sometimes even if divided into three 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.430
 I think I think my son 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.000
 each one has its characteristic 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:09.239
 any super cool and that's it I do not 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.239
 I'm going to play more levels than not 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.750

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:57.590
 You'll find it in the course of the game. 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.199

 I said I 'm addicted who will spend 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.949
 more is who likes star wars right now because 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.389

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.539
 others games 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.690
 angry birds is no longer my focus is what 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.690
 would be eagle on the normal billboard 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.990
 it can save those at those levels 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.830
