00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 good morning to all the boys today we are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 plan of joint space engineers and after 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.440
 release of the latest update I want to make you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.440
 see what they added 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:30.830
 here we are various glasses let's start here 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.190
 the glass this wind to 1 for one 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.040
 flat not aside is obscured by the other 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.330
 you see this is the same thing 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 one for a flat inverted ie that the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.739
 glass is always placed on the same 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.300
 block but this is reversed 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.420
 failure in the place to do things 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.440
 done well 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.550
 same thing 2 x 12 x an inverted mi 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.850
 seems to be a normal 3x2 excused block 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.020
 3 for the normal 3x2 inverted 3x3 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.940
 normal 3x3 inverted obviously on 01 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.630
 become a darkened on the other then 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.990
 go on 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.840
 they are all so weird types of glasses 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 all polluted to do 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.400
 sort of fate arose sort of domes 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.850
 in the normal part of the other and yes 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.770
 will see neglected by the other normal 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.960
 normal darkened darkened normal 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.020
 look carefully at this order and after 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.630
 built a place of this here 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.450
 on one side this of the other side always 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.810
 darkened in a darkened obscured not 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.150
 obscured inclined so of two of 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.760
 length and 1 in height or later you can 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.680
 reverse to become one in length 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.680
 but two of pulling height 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.950
 just me just not really 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 it can be said is one by one 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.820
 normally inclined well another 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.840
 very nice addition were these 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.610
 new stations these new settings 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 cockpit command posts yes 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.489
 can tell of the big ships they have 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.250
 added the one similar to the small ship 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.470
 This here is that normal is usual 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 a third that if I show the first one 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 and like that of the small ship but 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.019
 as big as the station lock 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.280
 great 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.310
 the second is the usual from the usual la 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.709
 third to a smaller boot but 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.470
 because this because he had to do it 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.910
 cool to get in here is to see 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.950
 also in first person as well as in 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.500
 third then you can create some 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.390
 large ships with big na'vi with 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.150
 a front dome of rear as it comes 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.970
 he had seen her drive it firsthand 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.290
 a majestic thing like the last one 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.450
 what this weird block is called 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.280
 it is called artifices to the mass max 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.480
 artificial artificial mass mass that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.990
 when powered, let's feed it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 with a very normal rectum 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.900
 follows the direction of gravity comes 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.250
 just pushes the whole block 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.740
 therefore towards the direction of truth 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.630
 be careful that now 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:34.600
 active all the gravity and down 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.600
 active generator attack and attention 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:44.060
 goodbye so you can create some 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.350
 very interesting things in the choir that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 fruit 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 for example this application here thing 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.430
 they are practically missiles 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.490
 huge with headboards 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.920
 then hooked onto the ship 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.590
 they follow the the ship they are hooked the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.230
 ship and when will be released i 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.880
 carts will be pushed automatically 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.290
 forward to infinity i believe now is 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.360
 a proof that they still do 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.209
 tried I want to try them with you for one 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.530
 time now has not put gravity because 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.300
 otherwise he would push the ship forward 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.760
 ii everything stuck and see 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.250
 this put this way generator 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.910
 that gravity was different on that side 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.790
 from the bottom then towards the tip of the ship 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.890
 note that when the missiles are released then 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.700
 they will go forward by force 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:41.900
 well then we can activate the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.900
 good gravity generator now I press p 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.770
 to release all those who are not 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.280
 I know how to call them let's see what happens 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.290
 in and launched guys well here they are 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.919
 been influenced by the severity of 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:02.199
 base but threatened as front 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.060
 park and why we never check great 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.669
 gravity player ok let's put a 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.759
 gravity generator here now should 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.319
 leaving because I have not got it wrong 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.210
 checked that the gravity arrived 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.020
 from the cd tip to the ship 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.020
 let's look higher 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:30.070
 attention pay pe is fired boom 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.480
 madonna bella is what I like added 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:39.010
 I really like it a lot and nothing like this 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.350
 it's everything from brutal to that 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.950
 guide of this ship one of the rockets 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.600
 hallucinating and everything I've already said not 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.700
 I know 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.700
 at the next goodbye video
