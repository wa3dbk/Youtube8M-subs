this has an 8 megapixel camera on the

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.940 
this has an 8 megapixel camera on the
back<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:45.100> got<00:00:45.250> an<00:00:45.340> Adreno<00:00:45.730> 320<00:00:46.210> GPU<00:00:46.770> there<00:00:47.770> is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
back it's got an Adreno 320 GPU there is

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.500 
back it's got an Adreno 320 GPU there is
no<00:00:48.129> LTE<00:00:48.579> though<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:48.969> I<00:00:49.000> know<00:00:49.059> that's<00:00:49.270> been<00:00:49.480> a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
no LTE though and I know that's been a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.450 
no LTE though and I know that's been a
sticking<00:00:49.780> point<00:00:50.020> for<00:00:50.170> many<00:00:50.500> of<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.890> know<00:00:51.100> LTE

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
sticking point for many of you know LTE

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.869 
sticking point for many of you know LTE
so<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:51.879> just<00:00:52.120> HH<00:00:52.890> hspa+<00:00:53.890> which<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.730> still

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
so it's just HH hspa+ which is still

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.430 
so it's just HH hspa+ which is still
plenty<00:00:55.059> fast<00:00:55.360> but<00:00:55.719> it's<00:00:55.840> definitely<00:00:56.050> not<00:00:56.379> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
plenty fast but it's definitely not the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.709 
plenty fast but it's definitely not the
newest<00:00:57.070> latest<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.579> greatest<00:00:57.820> wireless

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
newest latest and greatest wireless

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.500 
newest latest and greatest wireless
network<00:00:59.050> technology<00:00:59.620> and<00:00:59.890> LTE<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:00.789> it's<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.390> bit

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
network technology and LTE so it's a bit

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.299 
network technology and LTE so it's a bit
of<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.629> sticking<00:01:01.870> point<00:01:01.989> this<00:01:02.199> has<00:01:02.410> 16<00:01:02.920> gig<00:01:03.160> of

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
of a sticking point this has 16 gig of

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.219 
of a sticking point this has 16 gig of
internal<00:01:03.789> storage<00:01:04.000> in<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.570> they<00:01:04.689> also<00:01:04.839> make<00:01:05.110> an

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
internal storage in it they also make an

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.250 
internal storage in it they also make an
eight<00:01:05.379> gig<00:01:05.530> version<00:01:06.060> no<00:01:07.060> microSD<00:01:07.750> slot<00:01:07.780> so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
eight gig version no microSD slot so

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.539 
eight gig version no microSD slot so
you're<00:01:08.409> just<00:01:08.530> stuck<00:01:08.860> with<00:01:09.070> whatever<00:01:09.280> you've

you're just stuck with whatever you've
got<00:01:09.580> internally<00:01:10.450> but<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.049> one<00:01:11.200> only<00:01:11.320> cost

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
got internally but this one only cost

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.760 
got internally but this one only cost
349<00:01:12.220> dollars<00:01:12.760> no<00:01:13.000> contract<00:01:13.600> whatsoever<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
349 dollars no contract whatsoever the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.609 
349 dollars no contract whatsoever the
eight<00:01:14.950> gig<00:01:15.189> is<00:01:15.400> 299<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.390> again<00:01:16.630> no<00:01:16.960> contracts

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
eight gig is 299 and again no contracts

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
a 4.7 inch IPS plus display it's really

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.289 
a 4.7 inch IPS plus display it's really
nice<00:01:53.259> it's<00:01:53.590> HD<00:01:54.070> it's<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.700> same<00:01:54.909> one<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.149> was

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
nice it's HD it's the same one that was

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.780 
nice it's HD it's the same one that was
in<00:01:55.540> me<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> optimus<00:01:56.950> G<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:57.340> we've<00:01:57.460> seen<00:01:57.670> it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
in me in the optimus G so we've seen it

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.760 
in me in the optimus G so we've seen it
plenty<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.390> beautiful<00:01:58.899> but<00:01:59.110> one<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.710> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
plenty it's beautiful but one of the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.469 
plenty it's beautiful but one of the
cool<00:01:59.950> things<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.280> Google's<00:02:00.670> done<00:02:00.969> it's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
cool things that Google's done it's

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.580 
cool things that Google's done it's
going<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.719> be<00:02:01.810> tough<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.170> capture<00:02:02.439> on<00:02:02.560> camera

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
going to be tough to capture on camera

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.770 
going to be tough to capture on camera
but<00:02:03.040> they<00:02:03.130> actually<00:02:03.430> made<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.909> screen<00:02:04.390> sort

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
but they actually made the screen sort

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.100 
but they actually made the screen sort
of<00:02:04.899> cascade<00:02:05.619> over<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.340> over<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.090> outside<00:02:07.659> and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
of cascade over the over the outside and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.820 
of cascade over the over the outside and
so<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:09.009> sort<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.700> has<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.149> rounded<00:02:10.959> feel<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
so it sort of has this rounded feel to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.710 
so it sort of has this rounded feel to
it<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.610> put<00:02:12.760> your<00:02:12.819> finger<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.330> it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it so when you put your finger on it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.080 
it so when you put your finger on it
you<00:02:13.810> swipe<00:02:14.290> there's<00:02:14.890> no<00:02:15.070> edge<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.880> not<00:02:15.970> like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you swipe there's no edge it's not like

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.580 
you swipe there's no edge it's not like
you're<00:02:16.240> coming<00:02:16.450> from<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.690> sharp<00:02:16.990> edge<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.500> then

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you're coming from a sharp edge and then

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.200 
you're coming from a sharp edge and then
swiping<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.430> know<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.550> lot<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.730> people<00:02:18.820> start

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
swiping you know a lot of people start

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
swiping you know a lot of people start
their<00:02:19.240> finger<00:02:19.660> over<00:02:19.870> here<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:20.800> this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
their finger over here so it's just this

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.370 
their finger over here so it's just this
really<00:02:21.190> smooth<00:02:21.670> sort<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.060> field<00:02:22.270> also<00:02:22.930> this<00:02:23.140> I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
really smooth sort of field also this I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.980 
really smooth sort of field also this I
think<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:23.980> called<00:02:24.100> g2<00:02:24.610> hybrid<00:02:25.330> touches<00:02:25.810> what

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
think it's called g2 hybrid touches what

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.690 
think it's called g2 hybrid touches what
else<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.320> using<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.220> screen<00:02:27.340> just

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
else is using it and the screen just

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700 
else is using it and the screen just
feels<00:02:27.910> soft<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.870> touch<00:02:28.990> like<00:02:29.500> when<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
feels soft to the touch like when you

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.620 
feels soft to the touch like when you
touch<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.250> doesn't<00:02:30.430> feel<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:31.420> there's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
touch it it doesn't feel like there's

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.330 
touch it it doesn't feel like there's
any<00:02:31.780> resistance<00:02:32.380> your<00:02:32.620> finger<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.070> kind<00:02:33.280> of

any resistance your finger just kind of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.940 
any resistance your finger just kind of
glides<00:02:33.670> over<00:02:33.940> its<00:02:34.210> really<00:02:34.810> really<00:02:34.960> smooth<00:02:35.380> so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
know that sounds like a stretch but you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 
know that sounds like a stretch but you
know<00:03:34.120> google<00:03:34.390> sort<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.720> said<00:03:34.959> like<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.440> left

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
know google sort of said like we left

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.160 
know google sort of said like we left
LTE<00:03:36.459> out<00:03:36.760> because<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.239> want<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.540> battery<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.989> be

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
LTE out because we want a battery to be

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.620 
LTE out because we want a battery to be
good<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.580> then<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.940> battery<00:03:40.209> life<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.390> not

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
good and then the battery life is not

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.330 
good and then the battery life is not
really<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:40.989> awesome<00:03:41.290> once<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.860> turn<00:03:42.100> off

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.830 
Wi-Fi so had some battery issues i guess
i<00:03:45.820> shouldn't<00:03:46.030> say<00:03:46.090> issues<00:03:46.480> they<00:03:46.600> just<00:03:46.750> have

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
i shouldn't say issues they just have

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.240 
i shouldn't say issues they just have
the<00:03:47.110> battery<00:03:47.290> life<00:03:47.500> doesn't<00:03:47.709> blow<00:03:47.890> me<00:03:48.160> away

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
the battery life doesn't blow me away

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.400 
the battery life doesn't blow me away
i'm<00:03:48.489> getting<00:03:48.700> here<00:03:48.790> from<00:03:49.060> nine<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.570> 15<00:03:50.260> hours

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
i'm getting here from nine to 15 hours

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.530 
i'm getting here from nine to 15 hours
but<00:03:50.830> i<00:03:50.890> would<00:03:51.070> say<00:03:51.190> mostly<00:03:51.760> on<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.180> lower<00:03:52.420> end

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
but i would say mostly on the lower end

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.740 
but i would say mostly on the lower end
of<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.080> about<00:03:53.920> performance<00:03:54.910> responsiveness

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
of that about performance responsiveness

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.350 
of that about performance responsiveness
touched<00:03:56.739> all<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.220> stuff<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:58.000> good<00:03:58.180> as

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
touched all that stuff is as good as

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.509 
touched all that stuff is as good as
you'd<00:03:58.480> expect<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.620> high-end<00:03:59.799> phone<00:04:00.220> these

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
you'd expect in a high-end phone these

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.600 
you'd expect in a high-end phone these
days<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.019> then<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:02.920> only<00:04:03.070> other<00:04:03.190> thing<00:04:03.340> i

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
days and then the only other thing i

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.160 
days and then the only other thing i
guess<00:04:03.820> i<00:04:03.910> would<00:04:03.970> say<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.420> i<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.720> like<00:04:04.930> is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
guess i would say that i don't like is

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.259 
guess i would say that i don't like is

such<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> thing<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:19.690> concerns<00:04:20.470> me<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:20.830> bit

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
such a thing so concerns me a little bit

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
such a thing so concerns me a little bit
I<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.549> think<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.000> Google<00:04:22.270> least<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.349> think<00:04:23.440> I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
I do think that Google least I think I

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.050 
I do think that Google least I think I
remember<00:04:23.740> them<00:04:24.070> mentioning<00:04:24.099> that<00:04:24.669> they've

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
remember them mentioning that they've

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.230 
remember them mentioning that they've
sort<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.360> made<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.810> edge

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
sort of made the edge

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.600 
sort of made the edge
is<00:04:26.330> stick<00:04:27.050> up<00:04:27.259> so<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.560> frame<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.490> actually

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
is stick up so this frame it actually

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.760 
is stick up so this frame it actually
sticks<00:04:29.120> out<00:04:29.389> just<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.900> little<00:04:29.930> bit<00:04:30.139> more<00:04:30.410> over

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
sticks out just a little bit more over

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.409 
sticks out just a little bit more over
the<00:04:30.860> blood<00:04:31.220> over<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> glass<00:04:31.759> back<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.330> when

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the blood over the glass back so when

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.240 
the blood over the glass back so when
you<00:04:32.509> set<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.840> down<00:04:33.020> you're<00:04:33.620> actually<00:04:33.770> resting

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
you set it down you're actually resting

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.760 
you set it down you're actually resting
it<00:04:34.370> on<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.669> frame<00:04:35.060> rather<00:04:35.509> than<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.840> glass<00:04:36.110> so

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
it on the frame rather than the glass so

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.870 
it on the frame rather than the glass so
hopefully<00:04:37.039> that<00:04:37.190> will<00:04:37.310> help<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.610> little<00:04:37.699> bit

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
hopefully that will help a little bit

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.580 
hopefully that will help a little bit

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
like that but to finish this up let's

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.150 
like that but to finish this up let's
just<00:04:42.080> look<00:04:42.169> at<00:04:42.319> what<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.530> looks<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:42.830> compared

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
just look at what it looks like compared

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.800 
just look at what it looks like compared
to<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> couple<00:04:43.550> of<00:04:43.610> other<00:04:43.729> big<00:04:44.150> devices<00:04:44.690> out

Nexus which you all remember from last

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.430 
Nexus which you all remember from last
year<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.360> see<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.630> shape<00:04:51.020> of<00:04:51.259> them

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
year so you see the shape of them

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.650 
year so you see the shape of them
they're<00:04:51.680> actually<00:04:51.710> almost<00:04:52.280> identical<00:04:53.240> now

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660

the LG is a little bit wider than the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.300 
the LG is a little bit wider than the
Galaxy<00:04:56.479> Nexus<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.860> know<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.099> screen

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
Galaxy Nexus you know the screen

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.559 
Galaxy Nexus you know the screen
resolution<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> little<00:04:59.150> bit<00:04:59.240> different

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
resolution is a little bit different

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.390 
resolution is a little bit different
things<00:04:59.720> like<00:04:59.870> that<00:05:00.050> bump<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:01.039> once<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.310> get

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
things like that bump but once you get

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.490 
things like that bump but once you get
to<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.610> back<00:05:01.819> the<00:05:02.090> differences<00:05:02.569> are<00:05:02.599> very

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
to the back the differences are very

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.990 
to the back the differences are very
noticeable<00:05:03.979> you<00:05:04.159> can<00:05:04.280> see<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:04.729> sort<00:05:04.940> of

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
noticeable you can see this is sort of

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.360 
noticeable you can see this is sort of
plastic<00:05:05.659> material<00:05:06.199> sort<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.680> soft<00:05:07.009> touch

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
plastic material sort of a soft touch

plastic material sort of a soft touch
plastic<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:08.569> is<00:05:08.750> definitely<00:05:08.960> glass<00:05:09.500> LG

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
plastic this is definitely glass LG

I<00:05:21.349> wouldn't<00:05:21.740> necessarily<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.220> LG<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.789> thinner

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
I wouldn't necessarily the LG is thinner

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.930 
I wouldn't necessarily the LG is thinner
by<00:05:23.449> any<00:05:23.599> means<00:05:23.870> in<00:05:24.139> fact<00:05:24.440> in<00:05:25.159> some<00:05:25.190> places<00:05:25.639> it's

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
by any means in fact in some places it's

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.930 
by any means in fact in some places it's
thicker<00:05:26.210> some<00:05:26.599> lists<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.110> thinner<00:05:27.409> so

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
thicker some lists it's thinner so

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.100 
thicker some lists it's thinner so
that's<00:05:28.940> what<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.210> looks<00:05:29.360> like<00:05:29.509> there<00:05:29.780> anyway

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
that's what it looks like there anyway

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.620 
that's what it looks like there anyway
I'm<00:05:30.590> also<00:05:31.009> interesting<00:05:31.729> note<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.300> Galaxy

with this LG device they decided that

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.830 
with this LG device they decided that
was<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.009> experiment<00:05:44.000> they<00:05:44.090> didn't<00:05:44.509> need<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.719> go

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
was a experiment they didn't need to go

was a experiment they didn't need to go
down<00:05:45.080> that<00:05:45.380> road<00:05:45.830> anymore<00:05:46.159> so<00:05:46.490> I<00:05:46.669> here<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.150> is

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
down that road anymore so I here it is

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.200
