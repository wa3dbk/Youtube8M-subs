how<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> already<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.039> torn<00:00:20.250> apart

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
how I already have kind of torn apart

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.490 
how I already have kind of torn apart
for<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.510> looked<00:00:21.750> into<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
for that to be looked into and kind of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.529 
for that to be looked into and kind of
show<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> basics<00:00:23.100> over<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.580> well<00:00:23.760> so

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
show you the basics over that as well so

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
show you the basics over that as well so
getting<00:00:24.750> started<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.560> hardest<00:00:25.800> part<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.130> guess

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
getting started the hardest part I guess

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.779 
getting started the hardest part I guess
for<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.699> MSD<00:00:27.210> two-step<00:00:27.689> controller<00:00:28.609> is<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
for this MSD two-step controller is to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.859 
for this MSD two-step controller is to
find<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.090> where<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> want<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> mount<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
find out where you want to mount it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.330 
find out where you want to mount it
because<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.230> very<00:00:31.470> plug-and-play<00:00:31.769> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
because it is very plug-and-play it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270 
because it is very plug-and-play it's
very<00:00:32.550> simple<00:00:33.500> now<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.530> chose<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> mount<00:00:35.130> mine

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
very simple now I chose to mount mine

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
very simple now I chose to mount mine
over<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> passenger<00:00:36.570> side<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
over here on the passenger side of the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.530 
over here on the passenger side of the
vehicle<00:00:37.700> some<00:00:38.700> people<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.059> mount

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
vehicle some people like to mount

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
vehicle some people like to mount
there's<00:00:39.840> over<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> driver<00:00:40.860> side<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
there's over there on the driver side of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
there's over there on the driver side of
the<00:00:41.190> vehicle<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.760> each<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.000> their<00:00:42.120> own<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.570> chose

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the vehicle to each of their own I chose

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.330 
the vehicle to each of their own I chose
over<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.739> okay<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.489> let's<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.090> started

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
over here okay so let's get started

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.020 
over here okay so let's get started
now<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.940> big<00:00:48.090> long<00:00:49.160> wire<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.789> that's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
now there big long wire here that's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.060 
now there big long wire here that's
going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> obviously<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> two

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
going to obviously come out of the two

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.959 
going to obviously come out of the two
step<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.469> you're<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.590> run<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.309> over

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
step I you're gonna run it through over

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
step I you're gonna run it through over
here<00:00:57.180> plug<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.620> actual<00:00:58.980> coil

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
here plug it in to your actual coil

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.209 
here plug it in to your actual coil
packs<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.300> both<00:01:00.629> sides<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.949> side

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
packs on both sides now the one side

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
packs on both sides now the one side
you're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.609> come<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.850> over<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.420> unplug

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you're gonna come on over here unplug

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.469 
you're gonna come on over here unplug
your<00:01:04.890> factory<00:01:05.580> connector<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> goes<00:01:06.150> into

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
your factory connector that goes into

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
your factory connector that goes into
your<00:01:07.159> coil<00:01:08.159> pack<00:01:08.659> plug<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.140> MSD<00:01:11.210> I've<00:01:12.210> take

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
your coil pack plug in the MSD I've take

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
your coil pack plug in the MSD I've take
the<00:01:12.450> factory<00:01:13.439> wire<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.740> plugs<00:01:13.799> typically

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the factory wire that plugs typically

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.940 
the factory wire that plugs typically
into<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.330> coil<00:01:15.570> pack<00:01:15.810> plug<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> MSD

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
into your coil pack plug it into the MSD

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.760 
into your coil pack plug it into the MSD
to<00:01:17.130> step<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:18.000> simple<00:01:18.630> you're<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.680> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to step very simple you're going to do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.820 
to step very simple you're going to do
that<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.790> driver's<00:01:21.390> side<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.689> well<00:01:21.930> now

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that on the driver's side as well now

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.530 
that on the driver's side as well now
this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> where<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> guess<00:01:23.970> people<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
this is where I guess people to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.770 
this is where I guess people to
typically<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.439> kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> confused<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:27.439> how<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
typically get kind of confused on how to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.109 
typically get kind of confused on how to
have<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.810> activate<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.520> wire<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.909> use

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have it activate and what wire to use

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
have it activate and what wire to use
and<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:35.220> gonna<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.549> two

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and what to do now you're gonna have two

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.840 
and what to do now you're gonna have two
wires<00:01:36.780> coming<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.189> solid<00:01:38.640> blue

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
wires coming out of here the solid blue

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
wires coming out of here the solid blue
wire<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> pig<00:01:40.439> connector<00:01:41.070> here

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wire here what this pig connector here

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
wire here what this pig connector here
is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.880> ground<00:01:42.270> source<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:43.649> activate<00:01:44.070> your

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is a ground source to activate your

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.789 
is a ground source to activate your
two-step<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.090> however<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.960> am<00:01:46.380> NOT<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
two-step now however I am NOT going to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
two-step now however I am NOT going to
use<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.189> ground<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> tuck<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.570> under

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
use the ground so I tuck it up under

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.889 
use the ground so I tuck it up under
here<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.649> hide<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.430> wire<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.509> using

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.310 
volt source to activate my two-step and
so<00:01:59.520> it's<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> come<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.899> connector

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
so it's going to come with the connector

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.749 
so it's going to come with the connector
here<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> solid<00:02:02.700> blue<00:02:02.909> wire<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:05.189> run<00:02:05.640> your

here with a solid blue wire to run your

here with a solid blue wire to run your
source<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:07.129> now<00:02:08.160> I've<00:02:08.610> had<00:02:08.940> some<00:02:09.149> excess<00:02:09.509> wire

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
source for now I've had some excess wire

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.670 
source for now I've had some excess wire
left<00:02:10.920> over<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:12.270> chose<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> mount

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
left over because I chose to mount

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
left over because I chose to mount
mine<00:02:13.859> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.819> passenger<00:02:15.209> side<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.840> well

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
mine on the passenger side here as well

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.360 
mine on the passenger side here as well
as<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.319> guess<00:02:16.469> some<00:02:16.709> people<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.250> mount

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
as I guess some people like to mount

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780 
as I guess some people like to mount
there's<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.879> clutch<00:02:18.090> switch<00:02:18.530> up<00:02:19.530> under<00:02:19.799> there

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
there's the clutch switch up under there

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.509 
there's the clutch switch up under there
-<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.510> run<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> through<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.560> firewall<00:02:23.040> which

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
- and run it through the firewall which

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.429 
- and run it through the firewall which
I<00:02:23.760> choose<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.299> because<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.230> kind<00:02:25.409> of

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
I choose not to because it's kind of

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.259 
I choose not to because it's kind of
more<00:02:25.590> work<00:02:25.769> than<00:02:25.980> needed<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.730> I've<00:02:26.819> figured

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
more work than needed and I've figured

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.880 
more work than needed and I've figured
out<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.719> much<00:02:27.870> easier<00:02:27.900> way<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.409> doing<00:02:28.560> this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
out of a much easier way of doing this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.289 
out of a much easier way of doing this
now<00:02:29.609> I<00:02:29.700> run<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.269> source<00:02:30.540> wire<00:02:30.810> here<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:32.670> into

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
now I run this source wire here up into

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.539 
now I run this source wire here up into
my<00:02:33.510> factory<00:02:33.959> harness<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.400> protect

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
my factory harness here one to protect

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.899 
my factory harness here one to protect
the<00:02:35.819> wire<00:02:35.969> two<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.450> give<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.599> clean<00:02:36.900> look<00:02:37.879> now<00:02:38.879> I

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
the wire two to give a clean look now I

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.869 
the wire two to give a clean look now I
urge<00:02:39.689> it<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:39.989> into<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.340> over<00:02:41.639> and

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
urge it up into here up and over and

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.119 
urge it up into here up and over and
into<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.450> top<00:02:42.689> half<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.170> your<00:02:43.230> ECU<00:02:43.650> here

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
into the top half of your ECU here

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.819 
into the top half of your ECU here
you're<00:02:44.609> gonna<00:02:44.730> want<00:02:44.969> to<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.150> into<00:02:45.359> number<00:02:46.319> 32

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
you're gonna want to go into number 32

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.589 
you're gonna want to go into number 32
now<00:02:47.099> there's<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.459> small<00:02:47.790> numbers<00:02:48.269> you

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
now there's some small numbers you

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.300 
now there's some small numbers you
probably<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.079> can't<00:02:49.319> see<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.159> they're

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
probably really can't see but they're

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.390 
probably really can't see but they're
right<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:50.909> number<00:02:51.629> 32<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.409> a<00:02:52.439> great<00:02:52.799> source

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
right here number 32 is a great source

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.179 
right here number 32 is a great source
wire<00:02:53.730> okay<00:02:54.419> now<00:02:55.379> you're<00:02:55.769> gonna<00:02:55.859> want<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.099> be

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
wire okay now you're gonna want to be

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.800 
wire okay now you're gonna want to be
careful<00:02:56.609> because<00:02:56.760> there<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.150> many<00:02:57.329> gray

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
careful because there is many gray

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.119 
careful because there is many gray
source<00:02:58.079> wires<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.530> come<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.799> at<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:58.980> top

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
source wires that come out at the top

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.539 
source wires that come out at the top
half<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.669> so<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.329> what<00:03:01.109> I<00:03:01.169> do<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.769> peel

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
half of this so I what I do is I peel

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.929 
half of this so I what I do is I peel
away<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.939> harness<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:04.310> find<00:03:05.310> 32<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:05.849> I'm

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
away this harness here find 32 and I'm

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.190 
away this harness here find 32 and I'm
wiggle<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.359> around<00:03:06.419> to<00:03:06.719> make<00:03:06.780> sure<00:03:06.900> it's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
wiggle it around to make sure it's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.860 
wiggle it around to make sure it's
moving<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.189> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.819> tell<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.599> of

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
moving down there as you can tell out of

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.670 
moving down there as you can tell out of
32<00:03:10.260> okay<00:03:10.950> now<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.239> cut<00:03:12.719> and<00:03:12.959> splice<00:03:13.200> open<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
32 okay now I cut and splice open the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.069 
32 okay now I cut and splice open the
wire<00:03:13.909> peel<00:03:14.909> back<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.620> wire<00:03:16.829> here<00:03:17.269> feeding<00:03:18.269> my

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
wire peel back the wire here feeding my

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.409 
wire peel back the wire here feeding my
source<00:03:19.409> wires<00:03:19.650> solder<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.459> heat<00:03:20.909> shrink<00:03:21.269> it

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
source wires solder it in heat shrink it

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.300 
source wires solder it in heat shrink it
you're<00:03:21.629> good<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.019> go<00:03:22.099> okay

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you're good to go okay

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.369 
you're good to go okay
that's<00:03:23.549> pretty<00:03:23.790> much<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.120> install<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.319> the

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
that's pretty much the install of the

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.879 
that's pretty much the install of the
MSD<00:03:26.449> and<00:03:27.449> then<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:27.959> just<00:03:28.109> activate<00:03:28.500> it

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
MSD and then you can just activate it

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.649 
MSD and then you can just activate it
and<00:03:29.310> off<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.329> left<00:03:30.540> side<00:03:30.659> here<00:03:31.229> is<00:03:31.409> for<00:03:31.709> your

and off the left side here is for your
RPMs<00:03:33.659> by<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.870> thousands<00:03:34.439> and<00:03:34.620> then<00:03:34.829> off<00:03:35.189> to

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
RPMs by the thousands and then off to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.210 
RPMs by the thousands and then off to
the<00:03:35.370> right<00:03:35.549> side<00:03:35.819> is<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.329> knob<00:03:36.659> -<00:03:36.959> dialing<00:03:37.739> by

the right side is a knob - dialing by

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.899 
the right side is a knob - dialing by
hundreds<00:03:38.970> pretty<00:03:39.629> simple<00:03:40.519> so<00:03:41.519> while<00:03:41.669> I<00:03:41.699> got

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
hundreds pretty simple so while I got

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.159 
hundreds pretty simple so while I got
this<00:03:42.000> torn<00:03:42.239> apart<00:03:42.329> I'm<00:03:42.599> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.870> over<00:03:43.049> how

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
this torn apart I'm going to go over how

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.460 
this torn apart I'm going to go over how

okay<00:03:56.239> those<00:03:57.239> are<00:03:57.329> your<00:03:57.449> main<00:03:57.530> wires<00:03:59.150> now<00:04:00.150> your

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
okay those are your main wires now your

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.020 
okay those are your main wires now your
green<00:04:00.569> source<00:04:00.959> wire<00:04:01.489> you're<00:04:02.489> going<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.699> run

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
green source wire you're going to run

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.449 
green source wire you're going to run
into<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.689> bottom<00:04:04.109> side<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.680> ECU<00:04:05.009> over

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
into the bottom side of the ECU over

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.809 
into the bottom side of the ECU over
here<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:05.849> number<00:04:06.269> ten<00:04:07.169> it's<00:04:07.979> a<00:04:08.099> white<00:04:08.340> wire

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
here in number ten it's a white wire

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.490 
here in number ten it's a white wire
that<00:04:09.359> comes<00:04:09.629> out<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:09.900> I'll<00:04:09.989> be<00:04:10.109> careful

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that comes out and I'll be careful

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.319 
that comes out and I'll be careful
because<00:04:10.709> there<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.189> many<00:04:11.459> white<00:04:11.729> wires<00:04:12.060> as

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
because there is many white wires as

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.509 
because there is many white wires as
there<00:04:12.509> was<00:04:12.659> gray<00:04:12.900> wires<00:04:13.169> up<00:04:13.439> in<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.340> once

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
there was gray wires up in here so once

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.469 
there was gray wires up in here so once
again<00:04:14.639> you're<00:04:14.939> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.120> want<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.299> make<00:04:15.419> sure

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
again you're going to want to make sure

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.979 
again you're going to want to make sure
it<00:04:16.199> is<00:04:16.349> number<00:04:16.739> ten<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.509> that<00:04:18.509> you're<00:04:18.630> tapping

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
it is number ten and that you're tapping

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.629 
it is number ten and that you're tapping
into<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> same<00:04:19.799> thing<00:04:20.039> till<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.459> wire

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
into and do the same thing till the wire

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.409 
into and do the same thing till the wire
back<00:04:20.940> solder<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:22.849> heat<00:04:23.849> shrink<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.330> you're

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
back solder it heat shrink it and you're

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.570 
back solder it heat shrink it and you're
good<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.599> go<00:04:25.070> now<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.909> a<00:04:26.940> black<00:04:27.210> wire

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
good to go now this is a black wire

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.670 
good to go now this is a black wire
we<00:04:27.789> talked<00:04:28.030> about<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.240> green<00:04:28.479> wire<00:04:28.659> however<00:04:29.289> my

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
we talked about a green wire however my

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.469 
we talked about a green wire however my
factory<00:04:30.069> tag<00:04:30.280> didn't<00:04:30.610> have<00:04:30.729> long<00:04:31.419> enough

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
factory tag didn't have long enough

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.409 
factory tag didn't have long enough
green<00:04:32.020> wire<00:04:32.319> to<00:04:33.250> reach<00:04:33.370> Clarinda<00:04:34.000> here<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.389> I

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
green wire to reach Clarinda here so I

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.809 
green wire to reach Clarinda here so I
had<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.840> splice<00:04:35.139> in<00:04:35.409> this<00:04:35.590> black<00:04:35.860> wire<00:04:36.190> this

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
had to splice in this black wire this

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.360 
had to splice in this black wire this
essentially<00:04:37.659> is<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> tent<00:04:38.259> attached<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.190> the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
essentially is a tent attached to the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.760 
essentially is a tent attached to the
green<00:04:39.580> wire<00:04:39.849> that<00:04:39.879> comes<00:04:40.240> off<00:04:40.419> your<00:04:40.599> tack<00:04:40.780> okay

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
green wire that comes off your tack okay

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.279 
green wire that comes off your tack okay
now<00:04:42.430> how<00:04:42.789> you<00:04:42.819> want<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.210> run<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.479> has<00:04:43.810> up<00:04:44.229> to

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
now how you want to run that has up to

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.010 
now how you want to run that has up to
you<00:04:44.530> I've<00:04:44.740> got<00:04:44.770> mine<00:04:45.300> obviously<00:04:46.300> I'm<00:04:46.900> not

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
you I've got mine obviously I'm not

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.719 
you I've got mine obviously I'm not
gonna<00:04:47.139> go<00:04:47.289> into<00:04:47.470> detail<00:04:47.889> how<00:04:48.069> that's<00:04:48.280> all<00:04:48.430> ran

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
gonna go into detail how that's all ran

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.070 
gonna go into detail how that's all ran
because<00:04:48.970> that's<00:04:49.240> gonna<00:04:49.360> take<00:04:49.569> forever

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
because that's gonna take forever

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.230 
because that's gonna take forever
that's<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.680> mean<00:04:50.949> set<00:04:51.759> up<00:04:51.879> a<00:04:51.970> how<00:04:52.090> you're

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
that's the mean set up a how you're

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.149 
that's the mean set up a how you're
gonna<00:04:52.300> install<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.900> now<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.530> can<00:04:53.680> elaborate<00:04:54.099> a

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
gonna install that now I can elaborate a

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.649 
gonna install that now I can elaborate a
little<00:04:54.220> bit<00:04:54.400> more<00:04:54.669> on<00:04:54.849> how<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:57.610> hook<00:04:57.789> up<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
little bit more on how to hook up the

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:09.779 
little bit more on how to hook up the
tack<00:05:07.080> now<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.379> heater<00:05:08.590> vent<00:05:08.860> here<00:05:09.159> is<00:05:09.550> the

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
tack now in this heater vent here is the

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.279 
tack now in this heater vent here is the
white<00:05:09.940> wire<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.210> was<00:05:10.389> also<00:05:10.659> talking<00:05:10.900> about<00:05:11.020> that

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
white wire I was also talking about that

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.719 
white wire I was also talking about that
will<00:05:11.409> come<00:05:11.590> out<00:05:11.680> of<00:05:11.740> your<00:05:11.949> tack<00:05:12.159> you<00:05:12.490> can<00:05:12.610> also

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
will come out of your tack you can also

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.930 
will come out of your tack you can also
see<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.150> red<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:14.469> black<00:05:14.710> black<00:05:15.610> is

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
see the red and the black black is

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.990 
see the red and the black black is
ground<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:17.169> red<00:05:17.379> is<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.639> you're<00:05:18.759> just<00:05:18.819> gonna

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
ground the red is so you're just gonna

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.499 
ground the red is so you're just gonna
ground<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.479> out<00:05:20.129> your<00:05:21.129> red<00:05:21.340> wire<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:22.090> have

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
ground that out your red wire I have

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.129 
ground that out your red wire I have
hooked<00:05:22.719> to<00:05:22.960> my<00:05:23.409> ignition<00:05:24.129> so<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.930> comes<00:05:25.930> on

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
hooked to my ignition so it comes on

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.300 
hooked to my ignition so it comes on
when<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:27.490> key<00:05:27.699> is<00:05:27.969> an<00:05:28.180> accessory<00:05:28.599> now<00:05:29.310> your

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
when the key is an accessory now your

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.850 
when the key is an accessory now your
white<00:05:30.460> wire<00:05:30.699> here<00:05:31.169> just<00:05:32.169> tap<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.500> right<00:05:32.650> into

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
white wire here just tap it right into

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.189 
white wire here just tap it right into
here<00:05:33.279> so<00:05:33.430> when<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.509> actually<00:05:34.659> turn<00:05:35.020> your

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
here so when you actually turn your

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.050 
here so when you actually turn your
lights<00:05:35.440> on<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:36.099> actually<00:05:36.250> illuminates<00:05:36.849> the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
lights on and actually illuminates the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.499 
lights on and actually illuminates the
tack<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:38.080> pretty<00:05:38.979> simple<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.490> basic<00:05:39.940> on<00:05:40.180> the

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
tack so pretty simple and basic on the

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.920 
tack so pretty simple and basic on the
tack<00:05:40.750> as<00:05:40.930> well<00:05:41.110> now<00:05:41.529> on<00:05:42.159> the<00:05:42.550> LS<00:05:42.849> engines<00:05:43.360> the

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
tack as well now on the LS engines the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.879 
tack as well now on the LS engines the
way<00:05:44.169> there<00:05:44.529> ignition<00:05:44.889> setup<00:05:45.400> is<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.969> have<00:05:46.210> to

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
way there ignition setup is you have to

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.769 
way there ignition setup is you have to
actually<00:05:47.889> run<00:05:48.219> it<00:05:48.400> I<00:05:48.610> believe<00:05:49.120> is<00:05:49.419> what<00:05:49.630> they

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
actually run it I believe is what they

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.260 
actually run it I believe is what they
call<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.199> as<00:05:50.349> a<00:05:50.380> 4-cylinder<00:05:51.370> because<00:05:52.029> of<00:05:52.180> the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
call it as a 4-cylinder because of the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.930 
call it as a 4-cylinder because of the
way<00:05:52.389> they<00:05:52.750> run<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.139> now<00:05:53.349> I<00:05:53.770> don't<00:05:54.759> if<00:05:54.819> you<00:05:54.849> can

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
way they run it now I don't if you can

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.629 
way they run it now I don't if you can
see<00:05:55.270> but<00:05:55.569> you<00:05:55.599> have<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.840> cut<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.259> wire<00:05:56.639> you

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
see but you have to cut that wire you

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.490 
see but you have to cut that wire you
have<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:57.909> loop<00:05:58.150> wires<00:05:58.509> let<00:05:58.990> me<00:05:59.080> see<00:05:59.229> if<00:05:59.319> I<00:05:59.409> can

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
have to loop wires let me see if I can

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.990 
have to loop wires let me see if I can
get<00:05:59.590> a<00:05:59.620> better<00:05:59.770> angle<00:06:00.159> of<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:02.969> through<00:06:03.969> the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
get a better angle of it through the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.129 
get a better angle of it through the
back<00:06:04.240> here<00:06:06.150> you<00:06:07.150> have<00:06:07.210> two<00:06:07.449> looped<00:06:07.659> wires<00:06:07.930> that

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
back here you have two looped wires that

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.580 
back here you have two looped wires that
come<00:06:08.259> out<00:06:08.379> here<00:06:08.529> the<00:06:08.650> back<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.949> your<00:06:09.039> tack<00:06:10.590> a

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.619 
come out here the back of your tack a
brown<00:06:12.370> wire<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:13.000> a<00:06:13.150> blue<00:06:13.419> wire<00:06:14.250> brown<00:06:15.250> wire<00:06:15.629> is

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.629 
brown wire and a blue wire brown wire is

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.059 
brown wire and a blue wire brown wire is
over<00:06:16.990> there<00:06:17.169> as<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.469> can<00:06:17.500> tell<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:20.590> blue<00:06:20.800> wire

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
over there as you can tell the blue wire

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.110 
over there as you can tell the blue wire
is<00:06:21.340> right<00:06:21.940> there<00:06:22.180> you<00:06:22.810> snip<00:06:23.259> that<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:23.800> half

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
is right there you snip that in half

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.129 
is right there you snip that in half
okay<00:06:26.550> that<00:06:27.550> way<00:06:27.729> cuz<00:06:27.909> if<00:06:28.029> you<00:06:28.150> leave<00:06:28.719> it<00:06:28.900> hooked

okay that way cuz if you leave it hooked

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.749 
okay that way cuz if you leave it hooked
up<00:06:29.289> it's<00:06:29.650> it's<00:06:30.069> gonna<00:06:30.279> throw<00:06:30.430> your<00:06:30.580> tack

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
reading off okay so leave the brown wire

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.510 
reading off okay so leave the brown wire
just<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.529> way<00:06:35.649> it's<00:06:35.830> supposed<00:06:36.159> to<00:06:36.250> be<00:06:36.399> you

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
just the way it's supposed to be you

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
don't do anything with it the blue wire

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.970 
don't do anything with it the blue wire
there<00:06:38.680> you're<00:06:38.949> gonna<00:06:39.070> snip<00:06:39.599> so<00:06:40.599> pretty

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
there you're gonna snip so pretty

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.690 
there you're gonna snip so pretty
that's<00:06:42.930> logistics<00:06:43.930> of<00:06:44.020> how<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.170> do<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.700> let's

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
that's logistics of how to do it let's

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.820 
that's logistics of how to do it let's
fire<00:06:46.240> it<00:06:46.330> up<00:06:46.480> and<00:06:46.630> I'll<00:06:46.750> kind<00:06:46.960> of<00:06:47.020> let<00:06:47.530> you<00:06:47.620> hear
