00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.930
 hello today I bring you this look in which 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.850
 the products used just like the 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.610
 Most of the brushes are of the brand 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.110
 of mineral cosmetics da vinci da vinci a 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.000
 a brand that I had already heard 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.309
 very good opinions but that there was no 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.439
 had the luck to try now that if 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.570
 the bird I'm going to tell you what I think 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.339
 about her about her products in this 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.019
 video while also learning to 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.019
 perform the come let's go to it 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.820
 these are the four hair brushes 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.150
 natural that I'm going to use these shadows 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 da da vinci come in a tower we choose 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.850
 the color of bed centers and ready 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 we take a brush and we give 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 pat to remove excess 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.710
 shadow and we do the same thing working on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.079
 the back of our hand as it comes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.839
 from a shadow in powder first we go 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.329
 to apply with a few taps and 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.640
 then we will work it as if it were 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.200
 We apply a normal shadow in the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 eyelid mobile and motionless 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 we apply the same golden shade to rne 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.140
 of the lower lashes 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 this is the format of the shadows 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.159
 compact that also comes with a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.189
 sponge-shaped applicator 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.200
 with this golden brown shadow we are going to 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.930
 give depth to the look 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.110
 we take as a reference the eyelashes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 lower in the palm draw a line 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 as if we wanted to extend the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.520
 height that you want me in this case but 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.950
 no feline look 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 to delimit the makeup I'm going to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 draw a line how samu is drawn a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.810
 uvi here I will not go to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 apply the shadow more 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.880
 we apply the shadows above the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.520
 fold the eyelid and a little bit in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 end of the mobile eyelid and we blur 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.540
 very well 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.230
 moisten the brush I work the shadow and 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.240
 so I will create a more intense effect 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 even as if it were a profiler 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.280
 The good thing about these shadows is that if 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.460
 we want a more marked look simply 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.830
 we have to moisten the brush with the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.520
 brown shadow we are going to outline the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.700
 waterline 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.310
 we apply the golden shadow again 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.310
 and brown to intensify the makeup 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.710
 mascara and ready 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.410
 now let's continue with the face 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.950
 I will use this foundation 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.580
 in powder I put it on the back of a light 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.330
 tap cited for the product to come out 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.690
 beige and if I left the lid 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.620
 first we correct the imperfections and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.960
 the ojera applied the makeup with this 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 powder brush 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.040
 I remove the excess and make movements 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.549
 circular 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.290
 Leaves a very light finish and nothing 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.450
 loaded 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.870
 the more makeup we apply the more 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.870
 it covers 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.050
 we got a very nice blush with this 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.050
 rouge 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.150
 h a lip gloss without color the only thing 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.849
 what we have to do is wet the brush 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.209
 in the shade we want and not what 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.209
 we apply 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.150
 to a very beautiful color 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.530
 ah 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.200
 how the products of the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.060
 marca da vinci to me the truth is that what 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.549
 What I like most is the finish that 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.739
 they have the texture but especially the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.420
 versatility I hope you liked it and 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.420
 see you next trias
