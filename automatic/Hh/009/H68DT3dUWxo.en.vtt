 Thank you 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.400

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.559
 percent and tried to come with more and more points less possible maybe because 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.639
 After 20 years of teaching at the University of Ecology Biodiversity 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.329
 environmental impact 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.230
 maybe I should be bored talking about these issues but I'm not not because 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:09.169
 reading is amazing but things are fine at a normalism speed 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.919
 that climate change is evidence another thing is extrapolating towards 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.829
 the future 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.269
 if the trend at the end is confirmed towards a warming of so many 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.109

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.609
 the 20 year scenario effectively confirms that the brothers site very 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:29.599
 wet 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.959
 in short we have clues to follow 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.859
 how can those things be the acacias and and acts
