00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
not far from here where it was a whole

not far from here where it was a whole
bunch<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.469> bricks<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.089> did<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> stucco

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
bunch of bricks and so we did the stucco

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.060 
bunch of bricks and so we did the stucco

we left the hole and they placed a brick
in<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.820> without<00:00:18.060> looking<00:00:18.930> at<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.230> other

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
in and without looking at this other

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
in and without looking at this other
side<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.189> assumed<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> was<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> same

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
side I just assumed it was the same

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.990 
side I just assumed it was the same
situation<00:00:21.529> anyhow<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.310> homeowner<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.910> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
situation anyhow the homeowner and I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.029 
situation anyhow the homeowner and I
went<00:00:24.359> over<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.199> thought<00:00:25.410> gee<00:00:25.800> there's

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
went over this and I thought gee there's

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
went over this and I thought gee there's
a<00:00:26.130> lot<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.400> ways<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.660> no

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
a lot of ways to do this there's no

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
a lot of ways to do this there's no
backing<00:00:28.109> left<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.099> wall

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
backing left here because this wall

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.510 
backing left here because this wall
actually<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.880> coming<00:00:30.179> out<00:00:30.330> next<00:00:30.599> year<00:00:31.430> needs<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
actually is coming out next year needs a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
actually is coming out next year needs a
lot<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> wood<00:00:32.940> rot<00:00:33.120> repair<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:34.710> come<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
lot of wood rot repair so we come to the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
lot of wood rot repair so we come to the
conclusion<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.670> said<00:00:35.880> well<00:00:36.059> gee<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> could

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
conclusion I said well gee what we could

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
conclusion I said well gee what we could
do<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.500> stick<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> brick<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
do is we could stick a brick in here and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.510 
do is we could stick a brick in here and
I<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:40.170> throw<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> wire<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> won't

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I can throw a wire in there so it won't

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
I can throw a wire in there so it won't
fit<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.390> then<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> could<00:00:42.930> stucco<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> brick

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
fit it and then I could stucco the brick

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
fit it and then I could stucco the brick
and<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> give<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> give<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> stuff<00:00:45.510> of

the same slope so it's just for looks at

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.330 
the same slope so it's just for looks at
how<00:03:33.019> they're<00:03:33.200> gonna<00:03:33.260> tear<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.620> wall<00:03:33.830> out<00:03:33.890> but
