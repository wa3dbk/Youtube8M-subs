00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:13.570
 today I will teach how to make a braid of 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.570
 spike what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.580
 2.2 of the hair 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.030
 and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.099
 a comb 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.890
 like this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:43.090
 and if you want we can use a comb 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.559
 of these although this is optional what 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.480
 first thing we're going to do is comb 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 our hair properly 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.829
 that does not have any knots and that neither 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.689
 it can or anything like that is much more comfortable 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.380
 the next step that we are going to perform 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.850
 is going to be a tail to match 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.850
 we want to make our braid 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.230
 it is a very simple braid that remains 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.830
 really pretty 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.830
 ah 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.880
 once we have our tail made 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 the only thing we will have to do is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.570
 Separate the hair into two parts 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.570
 OK 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.500
 then the technique is to catch the end of 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.540
 one side and pass it to the center good to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.890
 center does not pass it to the other side is to say 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 from here I have passed here now from this 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.310
 better we will go to the other lock 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:27.020
 of this inn from the end we will pass to this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.020
 tuft and so we will be doing 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 until we finish our braid we have to 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.540
 say that this braid looks prettier 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.459
 if we do it with fine tufts 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.459
 that if we do it with fat strands 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.170
 it is also not necessary to put the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.990
 connected up here what happens is that 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.900
 would have put in order to have a greater 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.060
 subjection 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.600
 but we could also do it without 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 Need to 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400
 to put the tail 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.330
 As you can see it is completing 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.550
 our braid 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.760
 and finally we should put in the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.260
 end of the braid 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.260
 another hair gum 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.060
 how I'm going to see is a very simple braid 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.390
 and very showy 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.989
 we can not do it also is to ruffle 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.989
 the little bit 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.760
 and here would be the tang braid 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.760
 completed 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.800
 but we have liked it until then
