Walmart to begin cut 18 inches of the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.930 
Walmart to begin cut 18 inches of the
paper<00:00:37.199> and<00:00:37.470> then<00:00:37.710> start<00:00:37.980> folding<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.489> into<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
paper and then start folding it into a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:50.689 
paper and then start folding it into a
small<00:00:39.300> roll<00:00:48.589> now<00:00:49.589> using<00:00:49.979> scissors<00:00:50.220> cut<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
small roll now using scissors cut a

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.729 
small roll now using scissors cut a
curve<00:00:50.909> at<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.299> top<00:00:51.540> so<00:00:51.839> when<00:00:52.049> it's<00:00:52.170> unrolled

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
curve at the top so when it's unrolled

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:10.899 
curve at the top so when it's unrolled
it<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:53.010> create<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.519> scalloped<00:00:53.970> pattern

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909

or disbarred you can use any type of
wire<00:01:13.460> I'm<00:01:13.759> using<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.360> fluoro<00:01:14.689> one<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.590> start<00:01:15.860> on

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
wire I'm using a fluoro one so start on

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.859 
wire I'm using a fluoro one so start on
the<00:01:16.159> right<00:01:16.340> side<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.789> paper<00:01:17.000> feed<00:01:17.689> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the right side of the paper feed the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.719 
the right side of the paper feed the
wire<00:01:18.079> through<00:01:18.469> the<00:01:18.560> plot<00:01:18.890> side<00:01:19.189> until<00:01:19.610> you

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
wire through the plot side until you

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:32.139 
wire through the plot side until you
reach<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.119> other<00:01:20.270> end

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.660 

now<00:01:32.899> it's<00:01:33.200> time<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.530> create<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.100> stem<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
now it's time to create the stem of the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.789 
now it's time to create the stem of the
flower<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.570> decided<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.049> use<00:01:36.200> materials

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
flower and I decided to use materials

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.499 
flower and I decided to use materials
that<00:01:36.950> were<00:01:37.100> lying<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:37.670> my<00:01:37.700> room<00:01:38.030> like<00:01:38.270> this

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
that were lying in my room like this

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.139 
that were lying in my room like this
pencil<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.710> all<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:39.979> did<00:01:40.369> was<00:01:40.579> wrap<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.000> paper

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
pencil so all I did was wrap the paper

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.029 
pencil so all I did was wrap the paper
around<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:41.869> notice<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.530> while<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.740> keep

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
around and notice that while I keep

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.830 
around and notice that while I keep
wrapping<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.880> petals<00:01:44.210> will<00:01:44.390> start<00:01:44.720> to

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
wrapping it the petals will start to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.730 
wrapping it the petals will start to
take<00:01:45.049> form

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.390
