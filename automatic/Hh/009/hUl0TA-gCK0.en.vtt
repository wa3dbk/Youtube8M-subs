and<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.170> work<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.560> CSIRO<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.610> got<00:00:08.880> on<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.240> ship

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and I work for CSIRO I got on this ship

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.910 
and I work for CSIRO I got on this ship
the<00:00:09.480> southern<00:00:09.929> surveyor<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.530> measure<00:00:10.710> how

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
the southern surveyor to measure how

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
the southern surveyor to measure how
much<00:00:11.040> carbon<00:00:11.280> dioxide's<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> ocean<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
much carbon dioxide's in the ocean the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.900 
much carbon dioxide's in the ocean the
level<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.620> carbon<00:00:13.950> dioxide<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> ocean<00:00:14.849> is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
level of carbon dioxide in the ocean is

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.550 
level of carbon dioxide in the ocean is
really<00:00:15.179> important<00:00:15.630> because<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:16.109> affects<00:00:16.199> our

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
really important because it affects our

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380 
really important because it affects our
Earth's<00:00:16.800> climate<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.580> also<00:00:17.730> affects<00:00:18.000> how

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
Earth's climate and it also affects how

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.060 
Earth's climate and it also affects how
a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.750> important<00:00:19.260> organisms<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
a lot of important organisms in the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.330 
a lot of important organisms in the
ocean<00:00:20.100> grow<00:00:20.730> including<00:00:21.449> corals<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.980> thing<00:00:23.220> I

like<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.699> being<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.390> research<00:00:24.810> scientist<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
like about being a research scientist is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
like about being a research scientist is
that<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> work<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.210> interesting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
use the ship for research but let's go

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.340 
use the ship for research but let's go
onboard<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.980> I'll<00:00:38.070> show<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.340> around

step<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.500> it's<00:00:47.590> what<00:00:47.770> keeps<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.190> water<00:00:48.370> out

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
step and it's what keeps the water out

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.080 
step and it's what keeps the water out
of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.760> ship<00:00:48.970> in<00:00:49.120> rough<00:00:49.300> weather<00:00:50.970> even<00:00:51.970> though

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
of the ship in rough weather even though

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.420 
of the ship in rough weather even though
the<00:00:52.150> ship's<00:00:52.480> really<00:00:52.809> big<00:00:53.050> it<00:00:53.379> only<00:00:53.650> handles<00:00:54.040> 14

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
the ship's really big it only handles 14

are very heavy at the front of the ship
which<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.580> called<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.910> bow<00:01:04.089> there<00:01:04.390> are<00:01:04.449> cabins

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
which is called the bow there are cabins

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.239 
which is called the bow there are cabins
for<00:01:05.140> sleeping<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:05.770> let's<00:01:06.100> go<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.460> look

most<00:01:11.789> cabins<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.359> the<00:01:12.390> ship<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.020> bunks

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
most cabins on the ship have two bunks

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.830 
most cabins on the ship have two bunks
and<00:01:13.700> see<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.850> piece<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.240> material<00:01:15.359> up<00:01:15.810> here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and see this piece of material up here

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.139 
and see this piece of material up here
this<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.499> this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.310> stops<00:01:17.579> us<00:01:17.700> rolling

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
this what this is what stops us rolling

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.990 
this what this is what stops us rolling
out<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.600> rough<00:01:18.840> seas<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.679> over<00:01:20.069> here<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.969> have
