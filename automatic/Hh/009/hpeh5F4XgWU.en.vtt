00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
we're given instructions it's kind of

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.529 
we're given instructions it's kind of
funny<00:01:46.009> cuz<00:01:46.250> these<00:01:46.399> instructions<00:01:47.179> are<00:01:47.270> thinner

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
funny cuz these instructions are thinner

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.139 
funny cuz these instructions are thinner
than<00:01:47.599> the<00:01:47.810> ones<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.229> came<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.009> return

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.010 

which<00:01:53.149> I'm<00:01:53.270> not<00:01:53.420> sure<00:01:53.539> where<00:01:53.689> they<00:01:53.750> are<00:01:53.780> right

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
which I'm not sure where they are right

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.839 
which I'm not sure where they are right
now<00:01:54.110> look<00:01:54.439> I'd<00:01:55.009> say<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:55.399> at<00:01:55.459> least<00:01:55.520> half<00:01:55.819> the

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
now look I'd say it's at least half the

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:03.160 
now look I'd say it's at least half the
size<00:01:58.659> constructions<00:02:01.450> pick<00:02:02.450> some<00:02:02.599> of<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:02.750> off

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
size constructions pick some of this off

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:14.319 
size constructions pick some of this off
so<00:02:03.649> we're<00:02:03.829> gonna<00:02:03.920> really<00:02:04.369> one<00:02:04.549> sees<00:02:13.329> this

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
so we're gonna really one sees this

so we're gonna really one sees this
actually<00:02:15.040> went<00:02:16.040> around<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.670> pieces<00:02:21.700> so

gonna<00:03:02.780> be<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:03.920> didn't<00:03:04.160> measure<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.639> first

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
gonna be we didn't measure it at first

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.470

the features of the corner desk that I

talked about or the USB hub it wasn't

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.550 
talked about or the USB hub it wasn't
strong<00:04:22.340> enough<00:04:22.400> just<00:04:22.639> on<00:04:23.000> its<00:04:23.150> own<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:24.409> be<00:04:24.530> able

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
strong enough just on its own to be able

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.770 
strong enough just on its own to be able
to<00:04:24.710> use<00:04:24.860> all<00:04:25.099> four<00:04:25.130> ports<00:04:25.909> and<00:04:26.120> transfer<00:04:26.599> data

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
I've never ever had it scratch so I'm

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.880 
I've never ever had it scratch so I'm
not<00:06:17.150> sure<00:06:17.390> why<00:06:17.570> this<00:06:18.260> test<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.680> getting

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
not sure why this test is getting

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.770 
not sure why this test is getting
scratched<00:06:19.190> up<00:06:19.430> but<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.060> do<00:06:20.180> actually<00:06:20.360> have<00:06:20.660> like

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
scratched up but I do actually have like

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.930 
scratched up but I do actually have like
a<00:06:20.900> big<00:06:21.080> mat<00:06:21.260> that<00:06:21.500> I<00:06:21.590> use<00:06:22.070> for<00:06:22.220> playing<00:06:22.730> Magic

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
a big mat that I use for playing Magic

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.370 
a big mat that I use for playing Magic
the<00:06:23.150> Gathering<00:06:23.180> and<00:06:23.900> that<00:06:24.050> should<00:06:24.169> be<00:06:24.230> big

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
the Gathering and that should be big

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.690 
the Gathering and that should be big
enough<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.590> actually<00:06:24.770> put<00:06:25.040> all<00:06:25.070> three<00:06:25.460> devices

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
enough to actually put all three devices

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.820 
enough to actually put all three devices
on<00:06:25.970> there<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.870> I'm<00:06:26.990> gonna<00:06:27.110> try<00:06:27.320> that<00:06:27.500> out<00:06:27.530> and

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
on there and I'm gonna try that out and

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.490 
on there and I'm gonna try that out and
hopefully<00:06:28.600> that'll<00:06:29.600> cover<00:06:29.780> everything<00:06:30.050> up

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
hopefully that'll cover everything up

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.870 
hopefully that'll cover everything up
now<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:30.830> scratch<00:06:31.100> not<00:06:31.340> the<00:06:31.460> end<00:06:31.580> of<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.700> world

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
now the scratch not the end of the world

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.620 
now the scratch not the end of the world
but<00:06:32.450> really<00:06:33.110> that's<00:06:33.169> my<00:06:33.440> only<00:06:33.919> gripe<00:06:34.630> solid

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
but really that's my only gripe solid

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.469 
but really that's my only gripe solid
construction<00:06:36.700> feels<00:06:37.700> really<00:06:37.940> sturdy<00:06:38.150> I<00:06:38.300> could

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
construction feels really sturdy I could

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.540 
construction feels really sturdy I could
probably<00:06:38.630> stand<00:06:38.840> on<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.169> no<00:06:39.410> problem<00:06:39.950> you

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
probably stand on this no problem you

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.190 
probably stand on this no problem you
know<00:06:40.640> if<00:06:40.729> I<00:06:40.820> had<00:06:41.450> to<00:06:41.660> I<00:06:41.690> probably<00:06:41.990> see<00:06:42.080> a<00:06:42.110> little

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
know if I had to I probably see a little
