00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
you can sell those certificates on the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.199 
you can sell those certificates on the
auction<00:03:07.950> block<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.490> might<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.760> wrong<00:03:08.940> on<00:03:09.150> that

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209

of these signature series cards they're
pretty<00:04:08.610> cool<00:04:08.820> i<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.330> idea<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.780> it

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
pretty cool i like the idea of it

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.600 
pretty cool i like the idea of it
they're<00:04:10.500> probably<00:04:10.769> sell<00:04:11.100> for<00:04:11.130> about<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.580> same

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
they're probably sell for about the same

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.330 
they're probably sell for about the same
as<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.120> regular<00:04:12.299> card<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.170> as<00:04:13.440> long<00:04:14.130> as<00:04:14.220> you

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
as the regular card so as long as you

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
as the regular card so as long as you
can<00:04:14.489> do<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.820> them<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.450> i<00:04:16.229> believe<00:04:16.440> they're<00:04:16.590> on

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
can do on them and i believe they're on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
can do on them and i believe they're on
the<00:04:16.799> auction<00:04:16.919> block<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.400> might<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.580> able

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
the auction block so you might be able

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.890 
the auction block so you might be able
to<00:04:17.850> sell<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> certificate<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.600> authenticity

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
to sell the certificate of authenticity

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.750 
to sell the certificate of authenticity
and<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.680> might<00:04:19.859> be<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> way<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.250> make<00:04:20.489> coins

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
and that might be a way to make coins

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760
