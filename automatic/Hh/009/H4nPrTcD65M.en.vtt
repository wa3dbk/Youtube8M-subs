00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.299
 every kilometer in a region to fight 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.490
 these are the messages that you 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.490
 you have left on the skoda website 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.019
 Carlos, what do you think? 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:32.400
 I find it very funny I think what 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's go guys the goal is close to 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.220
 encouragement and therefore the truth I believe that no 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.470
 we can complain we are giving up 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.390
 albert and we are doing pretty 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.520
 back to the team andalusia and have 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.560
 reason and the goal is near 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.800
 will arrive at the end of the turn is already 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.070
 won is having won and it is true 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 true 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.320
 a message left to you our messages 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.539
 that you have to be with the same illusion 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.059
 since the first pedaling to the 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.430
 last is the case not always the same 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.930
 illusion if there is that up in the moments 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 bad are the good times there are 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.580
 you have to have hope you can always 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.409
 get things or fight for something there 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.780
 to suffer for the sugar cane champion and 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.729
 there's a lot about telling the truth 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.500
 that I think is suffering from the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.539
 first runner to the last meter 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.070
 back making a very hard return but 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.860
 we have to suffer a lot because we are all 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.380
 the songs of a message in the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.170
 bicycle for the people that that clothes and 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.320
 that help morale champions we're going to fight 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.100
 as brave you are very big 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 if you do what you can fight, do not 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.520
 get 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390

 kilometer giving everything encouragement with fire 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.650
 in each see that you give us, you make us sleepy 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 dreaming you do not always have to have dreams 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.900
 if it runs around Spain for us 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.750
 it was already a dream for example of the case and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.569

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.190
 very fast and we're going fast and we're 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.190
 fighting a lot against each other
