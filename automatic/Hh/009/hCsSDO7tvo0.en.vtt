insight<00:00:37.110> into<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.610> grand<00:00:38.970> prix<00:00:39.210> car<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
insight into what a grand prix car is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.280 
insight into what a grand prix car is
like<00:00:41.240> when<00:00:42.240> I<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.360> practicing<00:00:42.810> on<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.020> sim<00:00:43.200> we

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
like when I was practicing on the sim we

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950 
like when I was practicing on the sim we
did<00:00:43.470> i'm<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:44.010> full<00:00:44.370> full<00:00:44.970> loaded<00:00:45.390> fuel<00:00:45.630> car

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
did i'm like a full full loaded fuel car

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840 
did i'm like a full full loaded fuel car
and<00:00:46.260> then<00:00:46.740> went<00:00:46.950> straight<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.400> qualifying

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and then went straight to a qualifying

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760 
and then went straight to a qualifying
car<00:00:48.060> and<00:00:48.210> their<00:00:48.300> differences<00:00:48.870> unbelievable

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
car and their differences unbelievable

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
car and their differences unbelievable
it's<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.040> same<00:00:50.220> on<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.430> computer<00:00:50.940> games

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's the same on your computer games

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's the same on your computer games
i've<00:00:51.300> tried<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.720> i<00:00:51.960> went<00:00:52.380> from<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.620> road<00:00:52.800> car<00:00:53.070> at

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
i've tried it i went from a road car at

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
i've tried it i went from a road car at
a<00:00:53.310> hundred<00:00:53.550> points<00:00:53.850> about<00:00:54.150> to<00:00:54.330> 200mm<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.440> put

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a hundred points about to 200mm but put

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.960 
a hundred points about to 200mm but put
my<00:00:55.710> foot<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:55.920> thinking<00:00:56.370> i'll<00:00:56.460> never<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.910> able

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
my foot down thinking i'll never be able

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.660 
my foot down thinking i'll never be able
to<00:00:57.150> control<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.630> amount<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.080> power<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.040> many

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
to control this amount of power so many

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.460 
to control this amount of power so many
took<00:00:59.850> about<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> year<00:01:00.180> hundreds<00:01:00.720> very<00:01:01.050> yeah

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
took about a year hundreds very yeah

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.910 
took about a year hundreds very yeah
okay<00:01:01.800> yes<00:01:02.490> it's<00:01:03.450> actually<00:01:03.660> more<00:01:04.110> difficult<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.220 
okay yes it's actually more difficult to
get<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.549> precise<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:06.840> doing<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
get it so precise when you're doing it

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.750 
get it so precise when you're doing it
in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> simulator<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.190> when<00:01:08.370> you're<00:01:08.520> doing

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in the simulator then when you're doing

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270 
in the simulator then when you're doing
it<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.730 

actually<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:13.310> playing<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:14.090> lot<00:01:14.480> of<00:01:15.200> from<00:01:15.500> a<00:01:15.530> one

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
actually I playing a lot of from a one

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.560 
actually I playing a lot of from a one
game<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.220> learn<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.580> tracks<00:01:16.910> to<00:01:17.180> get<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> little

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
game to learn the tracks to get a little

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.160 
game to learn the tracks to get a little
bit<00:01:17.870> yet<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:19.370> feeling<00:01:19.730> of<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.940> track<00:01:23.170> because

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
bit yet the feeling of the track because

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.350 
bit yet the feeling of the track because
the<00:01:24.350> circuit<00:01:24.800> survey<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.610> star<00:01:26.060> accurate

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
the circuit survey is a star accurate

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.180 
the circuit survey is a star accurate
now<00:01:26.510> for<00:01:26.780> us<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.260> simulator<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.800> for<00:01:28.130> the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
now for us in the simulator and for the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.860 
now for us in the simulator and for the
game<00:01:28.370> as<00:01:28.580> well<00:01:28.730> you<00:01:29.000> can<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.240> drive<00:01:29.690> around

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
game as well you can just drive around

game as well you can just drive around
in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.230> game<00:01:30.410> on<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.770> same<00:01:31.190> circuit<00:01:31.640> you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
in the game on the same circuit you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.190 
in the game on the same circuit you
won't<00:01:31.850> get<00:01:32.000> any<00:01:32.090> surprises<00:01:32.420> when<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.840> turn<00:01:33.050> up

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
won't get any surprises when you turn up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.830 
won't get any surprises when you turn up
it<00:01:33.350> won't<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.590> completely<00:01:33.920> different

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
the car how close were we did we get it

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.919 
the car how close were we did we get it
right<00:01:43.700> yeah<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.329> actually<00:01:44.569> quite<00:01:44.659> funny

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
right yeah it's actually quite funny

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.270 
right yeah it's actually quite funny
because<00:01:45.140> when<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.530> was<00:01:45.649> playing<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.039> game<00:01:46.250> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
because when I was playing the game and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.099 
because when I was playing the game and
I<00:01:46.549> wasn't<00:01:46.729> hot<00:01:47.060> before<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.479> from<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:47.780> one<00:01:47.929> guy

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.179 
I wasn't hot before you from the one guy
I<00:01:48.229> really<00:01:48.469> fought<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.829> little<00:01:48.979> bit<00:01:49.069> too

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
I really fought it's a little bit too

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.279 
I really fought it's a little bit too
much<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.520> an<00:01:49.670> arcade<00:01:50.000> game<00:01:50.060> or<00:01:50.990> something

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
much like an arcade game or something

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.539 
much like an arcade game or something
like<00:01:51.409> that<00:01:51.469> but<00:01:51.829> now<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.039> really<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.459> say

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
like that but now I really have to say

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.680 
like that but now I really have to say
it's<00:01:52.880> really<00:01:53.060> good

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690
