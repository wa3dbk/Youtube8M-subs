00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello, welcome to another Tuesday of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.710
 tutorial or tuto Tuesday today I'm going to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.710
 draw because you asked for it 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.230
 pink 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.610
 start tracing the perimeter and the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.610
 petals that are further back 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.230
 the drawings in a kind of spiral 1 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.470
 cover the one below and the one below and the one 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.470
 down 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180
 when he arrived at the center I make the button and 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.360
 then the petals that are at your 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.360
 around 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.950
 since I have them traced I start them 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.950
 shade 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.620
 I'm going to put a few drops of water 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.910
 and spreading the graphite with your finger 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.910
 here are going to be the strongest shadows 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.180
 now he blurred with the brush if the 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.720
 surface is wide it is much better to use 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.720
 the brush 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.530
 after other droplets 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.479
 the petals look darker where 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.159
 they are born and they are clarifying outwards 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.729
 this is obviously because it gives them more light 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.729
 on the banks 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 blurred to make the graphite look more 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.659
 uniform and then pulled out lights with the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.659
 moldable eraser 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.290
 sometimes this does not erase as much as one 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.450
 I would like what I require for the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.460
 reflections of the drops so that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.840
 I need a sharp corner of a 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.840
 normal eraser for pencil 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 ah 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.630
 that was dramatic 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.350
 this sharp eraser is perfect for 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.600
 the details 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.540
 if you are going to try to cut it in your house 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.549
 please do it very carefully 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 if you have not seen the how-to tutorial 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.920
 do waterproof boots I recommend it I'll 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 to put the link here below at the end of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.810
 the description section of the video 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.629
 I continue to reinforce some shadows 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.549
 especially those that are next to 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.549
 lights to make them contrast 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.660
 for this drawing I used two 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 pens in the black I have a lace 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.230
 h which is more or less hard and in the red 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.569
 12 go softer for the dark ones 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.739
 you can see the list of materials in the 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.739
 video information 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.099
 I would love to know what you think 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.640
