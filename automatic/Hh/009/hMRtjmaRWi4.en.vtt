00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:10.760
 hi friends gentlemen perez and in this 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.549
 new video I come to you with some clear 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.030
 to install them to your gta as this is 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.340
 a very easy procedure 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.110
 well let's start the first thing that 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are going to do is to leave someone who 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.670
 I will leave the description of the video 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.710
 here as you see it does not weigh so much only 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.780
 weighs 441 kilobytes now let's extract 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.380
 the rar file we are going to click on 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.340
 right and extract here if you give here 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.780
 Well that's the same thing and here, too, 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.420
 practically the same is that these 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.430
 two what happens is that if for example 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.690
 we extract this in time example 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.969
 sorry let's give them and here 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.739
 what he is going to do is create us a 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.379
 folder and inside that folder is 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.199
 the folders from where they are 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.610
 the smoke is the same thing to give here and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.300
 here 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.510
 well once extracted from this we are going to 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.490
 to go 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.530
 to the folder and we're going to install this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.370
 program because if this program does not 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.740
