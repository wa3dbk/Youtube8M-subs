00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
these need treatment before we would

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
even consider stem cell therapy at the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990 
even consider stem cell therapy at the
point<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.740> decided<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.400> pet<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.880> an

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
point we decided this pet is an

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.510 
point we decided this pet is an
excellent<00:02:51.420> candidate<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.920> come<00:02:53.220> in

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
excellent candidate they then come in

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.760 
excellent candidate they then come in
for<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> surgical<00:02:54.540> harvest<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.530> it's<00:02:55.680> an

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
for a surgical harvest so it's an

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.380 
for a surgical harvest so it's an
anesthetic<00:02:56.310> procedure<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.150> pain

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
anesthetic procedure we use pain

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.860 
anesthetic procedure we use pain
medication<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:59.220> collect<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.450> sample

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.540 

um<00:04:06.500> there's<00:04:07.500> two<00:04:07.740> points<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> recovery

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
um there's two points to the recovery

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.120 
um there's two points to the recovery
time<00:04:08.880> one<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.390> harvesting<00:04:09.960> we<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.770> suture

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
time one is the harvesting we do suture

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.100 
time one is the harvesting we do suture
removal<00:04:11.490> in<00:04:11.580> two<00:04:11.760> weeks<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.300> lot<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.600> times<00:04:12.900> that

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
removal in two weeks a lot of times that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.470 
removal in two weeks a lot of times that
can<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.530> more<00:04:13.710> problematic<00:04:14.580> site<00:04:14.910> because

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
can be the more problematic site because

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.860 
can be the more problematic site because
there's<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.620> scar<00:04:17.160> there<00:04:17.220> sutures<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.180> animal

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
there's a scar there sutures the animal

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.660 
there's a scar there sutures the animal
they<00:04:18.959> bother<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.830> animal<00:04:20.190> needs<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> leave

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
they bother it the animal needs to leave

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.340 
they bother it the animal needs to leave
it<00:04:20.790> alone<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.330> need<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.570> make<00:04:21.690> sure<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.900> point

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
it alone we need to make sure that point

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.770 
it alone we need to make sure that point
doesn't<00:04:22.710> get<00:04:22.830> infected<00:04:22.950> as<00:04:23.520> far<00:04:24.360> as<00:04:24.390> seeing

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
doesn't get infected as far as seeing

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.830 
doesn't get infected as far as seeing
results<00:04:25.050> from<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.740> injection<00:04:26.720> owners<00:04:27.720> are

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
results from the injection owners are

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.900 
results from the injection owners are
reporting<00:04:28.350> quite<00:04:28.710> rapidly<00:04:29.400> they're<00:04:29.670> seeing

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
reporting quite rapidly they're seeing

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.010 
reporting quite rapidly they're seeing
the<00:04:30.060> pets<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.450> more<00:04:30.630> comfortable<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:32.930> think<00:04:33.930> it

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
the pets are more comfortable I think it

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.870 
the pets are more comfortable I think it
varies<00:04:34.410> but<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.650> think<00:04:34.920> within<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.340> week<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.700> two

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
varies but I think within a week to two

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.610 
varies but I think within a week to two
weeks<00:04:35.910> we<00:04:36.330> should<00:04:36.510> expect<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.960> see<00:04:37.140> some<00:04:37.170> sort

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
weeks we should expect to see some sort

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.270 
weeks we should expect to see some sort

at stem cell therapy they felt that they

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
do stem cells then they felt like they

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.230 
do stem cells then they felt like they
could<00:05:42.289> do<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.620> with<00:05:42.800> placental<00:05:43.280> cord<00:05:43.639> where

could do it with placental cord where

and that got into a whole bunch of

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.469 
and that got into a whole bunch of
issues<00:05:49.069> that<00:05:49.099> people<00:05:49.520> feel<00:05:49.909> one<00:05:50.150> way<00:05:50.330> or<00:05:50.449> the

issues that people feel one way or the
other<00:05:50.569> on<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:52.180> now<00:05:53.180> we're<00:05:54.020> into<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.710> level

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
other on and now we're into a level

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.300 
other on and now we're into a level
where<00:05:55.550> we<00:05:55.610> can<00:05:55.909> use<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> person's<00:05:56.599> own<00:05:56.840> tissue

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
where we can use a person's own tissue

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.300 
where we can use a person's own tissue

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
so we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.159 
so we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul
we're<00:06:01.310> not<00:06:01.460> handicapping<00:06:02.180> someone<00:06:02.750> else's

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
we're not handicapping someone else's

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.249 
we're not handicapping someone else's
life<00:06:03.439> but<00:06:04.159> I<00:06:04.189> think<00:06:04.550> because<00:06:04.759> of<00:06:04.969> the

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
life but I think because of the

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.779 
life but I think because of the

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
know how long this will last but

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.290 
know how long this will last but
hopefully<00:07:14.480> will<00:07:14.690> it'll<00:07:15.560> last<00:07:15.740> some<00:07:16.520> time<00:07:16.760> the

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
hopefully will it'll last some time the

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.960 
hopefully will it'll last some time the
other<00:07:17.450> thing<00:07:17.690> is<00:07:17.870> vet<00:07:18.140> stem<00:07:18.440> banks<00:07:18.980> cells<00:07:19.430> from

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:19.970 
other thing is vet stem banks cells from

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.630 
other thing is vet stem banks cells from
this<00:07:20.210> dog<00:07:20.450> and<00:07:20.750> those<00:07:21.650> cells<00:07:21.980> are<00:07:22.130> available

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
this dog and those cells are available

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.140 
this dog and those cells are available
to<00:07:22.790> me<00:07:24.040> for<00:07:25.040> the<00:07:25.130> dog<00:07:25.310> to<00:07:25.340> get<00:07:25.550> reinjection

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
to me for the dog to get reinjection

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.140 
to me for the dog to get reinjection
because<00:07:26.600> it's<00:07:27.040> with<00:07:28.040> the<00:07:28.070> Arthritis<00:07:28.760> I<00:07:28.940> think

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 
because it's with the Arthritis I think

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.220 
because it's with the Arthritis I think
you<00:07:29.270> slowed<00:07:29.510> it<00:07:29.630> down<00:07:29.660> but<00:07:29.840> you<00:07:30.020> never

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.230 
you slowed it down but you never

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.280 
you slowed it down but you never
completely<00:07:30.650> stop<00:07:31.040> it<00:07:31.280> so<00:07:31.940> the<00:07:32.360> reinjection

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290 
completely stop it so the reinjection

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:54.119 
completely stop it so the reinjection
will<00:07:33.680> be<00:07:33.890> needed

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:54.129 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:08:14.040 

you

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.050 

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.110
