and everybody's different but for me I

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.960 
and everybody's different but for me I
don't<00:01:17.890> think<00:01:18.100> about<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.430> whole<00:01:18.610> hundred

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970

don't think about the whole hundred
miles<00:01:19.180> if<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.420> think<00:01:19.660> about<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.870> hundred<00:01:19.990> miles

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290

miles if you think about a hundred miles
that<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.650> me<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.770> just<00:01:20.890> way<00:01:21.130> too<00:01:21.190> overwhelming

that to me is just way too overwhelming
and<00:01:22.390> what<00:01:22.570> I<00:01:22.600> do<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.870> I<00:01:22.960> break<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.320> race<00:01:23.470> down

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
and what I do is I break the race down

and what I do is I break the race down
and<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.580> think<00:01:24.790> of<00:01:24.880> more<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.180> race<00:01:25.300> in<00:01:25.570> either

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
and I think of more the race in either

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.320 
and I think of more the race in either
10<00:01:26.200> or<00:01:26.229> 15<00:01:26.710> or<00:01:26.770> 20<00:01:27.100> mile<00:01:27.220> increments<00:01:27.850> what<00:01:28.300> I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
10 or 15 or 20 mile increments what I

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.150 
10 or 15 or 20 mile increments what I
think<00:01:28.630> about<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.200> got<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.440> job<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.800> do<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.130> just

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160

race like this what goes through my mind

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.960 
race like this what goes through my mind
once<00:01:44.440> again<00:01:44.650> I<00:01:44.740> think<00:01:44.950> about<00:01:45.130> each<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.460> station

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
once again I think about each a station

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.710 
once again I think about each a station
I<00:01:46.060> break<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.420> up

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
I break it up

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.690 
I break it up
and<00:01:47.619> what<00:01:47.830> am<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:47.979> going<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.160> do<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.340> get<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.610> up

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
and what am I going to do to get that up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.340 
and what am I going to do to get that up
to<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.090> next<00:01:49.270> aid<00:01:49.479> station<00:01:49.960> what<00:01:50.140> will<00:01:50.229> I<00:01:50.259> do

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
to that next aid station what will I do

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.960 
to that next aid station what will I do
after<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.640> break<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.910> up

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
after that and so I just break it up

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.030 
after that and so I just break it up
into<00:01:52.119> increments<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.680> Sun<00:01:53.890> Goes

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
into increments but as that Sun Goes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.440 
into increments but as that Sun Goes
Down<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.400> starts<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.790> get<00:01:54.880> dark<00:01:54.940> then<00:01:55.360> you're

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
Down it starts to get dark then you're

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.730 
Down it starts to get dark then you're
starting<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.869> think<00:01:55.900> you've<00:01:56.320> started<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.560> kind

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
starting to think you've started to kind

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.200 
starting to think you've started to kind
of<00:01:56.800> gear<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.009> little<00:01:57.070> differently<00:01:57.640> because

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
of gear a little differently because

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.210 
of gear a little differently because
during<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.630> daytime<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.259> can<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.920> can<00:02:00.070> move

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
during the daytime you can you can move

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.030 
during the daytime you can you can move
faster<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.910> can<00:02:01.060> see<00:02:01.900> ahead<00:02:02.020> farther<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.890> mean

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
faster you can see ahead farther I mean

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.770 
faster you can see ahead farther I mean
your<00:02:03.160> vision<00:02:03.580> there's<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.270> lot<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.509> things<00:02:04.660> that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
your vision there's a lot of things that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.880 
your vision there's a lot of things that
come<00:02:04.899> into<00:02:05.020> play<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:05.440> different<00:02:05.800> your

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
come into play that are different your

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.590 
come into play that are different your
body's<00:02:06.220> more<00:02:06.369> relaxed<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.300> as<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.479> go

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
body's more relaxed and as you go

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.029 
body's more relaxed and as you go
through<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.899> night<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.140> tend<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.380> tighten<00:02:08.860> up

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
through the night you tend to tighten up

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.200 
through the night you tend to tighten up
probably<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.310> little<00:02:09.550> bit<00:02:09.700> because<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.090> are<00:02:10.149> a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
probably a little bit because you are a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.730 
probably a little bit because you are a
little<00:02:10.330> bit<00:02:10.539> more<00:02:10.690> tense<00:02:10.929> about<00:02:11.110> your<00:02:11.319> footing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
little bit more tense about your footing

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.530 
little bit more tense about your footing
and<00:02:12.220> where<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.550> are<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.150> race<00:02:13.390> in

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and where you are and in this race in

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.170 
and where you are and in this race in
this<00:02:13.630> case<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.800> are<00:02:14.890> some<00:02:15.040> drop-offs<00:02:15.490> and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
this case there are some drop-offs and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.400 
this case there are some drop-offs and
you're<00:02:16.480> gonna<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.900> alert<00:02:17.140> at<00:02:17.380> all

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you're gonna have to be alert at all

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.010 
you're gonna have to be alert at all
times<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:19.240> there<00:02:19.390> really<00:02:19.480> isn't<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.780> time<00:02:19.990> to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
times so there really isn't it time to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.230 
times so there really isn't it time to
get<00:02:20.200> tired<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.740> mean<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.950> might<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.250> sleepy

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240

get tired I mean you might get sleepy
and<00:02:22.420> kind<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.810> quiet<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.319> things<00:02:23.770> like<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
and kind of quiet and things like that

going<00:02:24.880> through<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> night<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
going through the night it's just a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.110 
going through the night it's just a
matter<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.069> have<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.090> just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
matter of you have to do it and you just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.920 
matter of you have to do it and you just
keep<00:02:28.420> moving<00:02:28.480> through<00:02:28.900> it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
keep moving through it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.369 
keep moving through it
the<00:02:30.230> hardest<00:02:30.620> part<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.250> race<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:32.170> don't<00:02:33.170> know

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
the hardest part of a race I don't know

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.809 
the hardest part of a race I don't know
if<00:02:33.440> hardest<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:33.890> really<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.160> word<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:34.580> it

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
if hardest is really the word for it

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.070 
if hardest is really the word for it
I<00:02:34.849> truly<00:02:35.330> believe<00:02:35.599> if<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.810> don't<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.050> a

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
I truly believe if you don't have a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.610 
I truly believe if you don't have a
passion<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.590> do<00:02:36.769> this<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:38.420> heart<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.410> word

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
passion to do this if heart is a word

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.770 
passion to do this if heart is a word
that<00:02:39.769> you're<00:02:39.860> thinking<00:02:40.099> then<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:41.569> really

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
that you're thinking then then really

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.000 
that you're thinking then then really
this<00:02:41.870> isn't<00:02:42.200> something<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.440> should<00:02:42.470> be<00:02:42.680> doing

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
don't have gear out there that doesn't

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.509 
don't have gear out there that doesn't
work<00:03:24.560> you're<00:03:24.709> not<00:03:24.799> going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.099> continue<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
work you're not going to continue you

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.130 
work you're not going to continue you
know<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.640> race<00:03:28.849> like<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.269> people<00:03:29.780> ask<00:03:29.959> how

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
know a race like this people ask how

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.660 
know a race like this people ask how
much<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.410> physical<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:30.950> how<00:03:31.040> much<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.310> mental

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
much is physical and how much is mental

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.539 
much is physical and how much is mental
I<00:03:31.879> truly<00:03:32.780> feel<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.160> races<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.400> are

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
I truly feel that races like this are

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.770 
I truly feel that races like this are
more<00:03:34.700> mental<00:03:35.150> than<00:03:35.180> physical

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
more mental than physical

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.120 
more mental than physical
so<00:03:35.959> I'd<00:03:36.049> say<00:03:36.170> mentally<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:36.950> be<00:03:37.010> more

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
so I'd say mentally you have to be more

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.979 
so I'd say mentally you have to be more
prepared<00:03:37.519> that<00:03:38.299> probably<00:03:38.540> takes<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.900> a

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
prepared that probably takes more of a

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.400 
prepared that probably takes more of a
beating<00:03:39.319> is<00:03:39.500> pushing<00:03:40.310> yourself<00:03:41.290> having<00:03:42.290> your

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
beating is pushing yourself having your

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.309 
beating is pushing yourself having your
confidence<00:03:42.920> being<00:03:43.160> able<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.340> perform<00:03:44.319> and

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
confidence being able to perform and

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.479 
confidence being able to perform and
being<00:03:45.530> in<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.709> zone<00:03:45.889> I<00:03:45.920> talk<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.250> lot<00:03:46.370> about

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
being in the zone I talk a lot about

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.849 
being in the zone I talk a lot about
being<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.269> zone<00:03:47.299> or<00:03:47.720> flowing<00:03:48.109> where<00:03:48.799> you

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
being in the zone or flowing where you

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:49.780 
being in the zone or flowing where you
can<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.130> out<00:03:49.250> there<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.489> almost<00:03:49.670> be

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
can be out there and almost be

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.160 
can be out there and almost be
subconscious<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.599> just<00:03:50.750> keeping<00:03:51.109> yourself

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
subconscious and just keeping yourself

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.610 
subconscious and just keeping yourself
moving<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.250> how<00:03:52.549> do<00:03:52.609> you<00:03:52.700> get<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.090> state

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
moving and how do you get to that state

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.170 
moving and how do you get to that state
you<00:03:54.620> go<00:03:54.799> through<00:03:54.950> an<00:03:55.010> extreme<00:03:55.340> amount<00:03:55.519> of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
you go through an extreme amount of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.520 
you go through an extreme amount of
variations<00:03:57.180> through<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.420> course<00:03:57.689> and<00:03:58.379> so

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
variations through the course and so

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.870 
variations through the course and so
really<00:03:58.680> explain<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.280> somebody<00:03:59.489> it<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.569> hard
