but for now let's have a look at how the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
but for now let's have a look at how the
software<00:00:52.170> handles<00:00:52.410> modeling<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.489> 3d

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
geometric profiles and extrusion tools
you'll<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.270> find<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> software<00:01:01.379> has<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you'll also find that the software has a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.889 
you'll also find that the software has a
rich<00:01:01.800> set<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> tools<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> model<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.239> point

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
modeling commands here is for example

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
modeling commands here is for example
how<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> might<00:01:10.500> revolve<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.189> spline<00:01:11.670> into<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
how you might revolve a spline into a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.859 
how you might revolve a spline into a
profile<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:14.150> here<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> would

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
profile and then here is how you would

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
profile and then here is how you would
use<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.110> spline<00:01:16.650> projected<00:01:17.549> along<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> profile

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
use a spline projected along a profile

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
use a spline projected along a profile
as<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.080> dissecting<00:01:19.830> line<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> slice<00:01:20.670> through

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
as a dissecting line to slice through

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.410 
as a dissecting line to slice through
that<00:01:21.150> model

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.120 

you

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.920 

now<00:01:37.130> as<00:01:37.370> you<00:01:37.580> changed<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.270> position<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
now as you changed the position of the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.750 
now as you changed the position of the
dissecting<00:01:39.320> line<00:01:39.740> you'll<00:01:39.980> notice<00:01:40.370> that<00:01:40.550> the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
dissecting line you'll notice that the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.930 
dissecting line you'll notice that the
sliced<00:01:41.180> object<00:01:41.960> also<00:01:42.380> updated<00:01:43.370> surfaces

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
sliced object also updated surfaces

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.530 
sliced object also updated surfaces
accordingly

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
accordingly

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.480 
accordingly
it<00:01:44.960> shows<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.470> software<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.980> great<00:01:46.280> at

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
it shows the software is great at

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.420 
it shows the software is great at
tracking<00:01:46.940> geometric<00:01:47.570> relationships

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
tracking geometric relationships

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.560 
tracking geometric relationships
something<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.910> would<00:01:50.060> expect<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.510> see

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
something that you would expect to see

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.790 
something that you would expect to see
in<00:01:50.960> parametric<00:01:51.680> modeling<00:01:52.280> programs

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.010 

the<00:01:55.800> subway<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.400> has<00:01:56.580> an<00:01:56.760> automatic<00:01:57.360> surface

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the subway also has an automatic surface

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
the subway also has an automatic surface
patching<00:01:58.530> -<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.220> very<00:01:59.430> useful<00:01:59.820> way<00:01:59.970> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
patching - it's a very useful way to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.360 
patching - it's a very useful way to
connect<00:02:00.540> surfaces<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.410> are<00:02:01.470> apart<00:02:02.220> from
