00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
so we decided to make this about three
albums<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.579> filled<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> form<00:00:58.140> is

spine<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.649> game<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.109> made<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
spine of the game and then we made it so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.750 
spine of the game and then we made it so
if<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.010> three<00:01:02.160> albums<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
if there are three albums there are

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
if there are three albums there are
three<00:01:02.910> concerts<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.840> instead<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.320> going

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
through their entire career which using

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270 
through their entire career which using
these<00:01:05.760> key<00:01:06.210> three<00:01:06.600> moments<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
these key three moments to have like a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
these key three moments to have like a
special<00:01:08.430> concert<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.030> special<00:01:09.299> menu<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.720> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
special concert in special menu and we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
special concert in special menu and we
add<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> cool<00:01:10.890> details<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.369> nuances

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
add a lot of cool details and nuances

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
add a lot of cool details and nuances
that<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.600> only<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that you can only really do when you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
that you can only really do when you
concentrate<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.010> three<00:01:14.159> spaces<00:01:14.630> so

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
concentrate on like three spaces so

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
concentrate on like three spaces so
that's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.080> big<00:01:16.200> difference<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.619> focus<00:01:16.890> there

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's a big difference that focus there

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.039 
that's a big difference that focus there
we<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.400> twice<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.479> video

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we have about twice as much video

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.899 
we have about twice as much video
material<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.130> did<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.280> Beatles<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
material as we did in Beatles just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.130 
material as we did in Beatles just
because<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.240> sort<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.720> grow<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> air

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
because they sort of grow up in the air

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
because they sort of grow up in the air
of<00:01:22.259> MTV<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.979> lots<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> material<00:01:23.340> to

reason why was there was this meant to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
reason why was there was this meant to
happen<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.240> from<00:01:57.450> Beatles<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.079> green
