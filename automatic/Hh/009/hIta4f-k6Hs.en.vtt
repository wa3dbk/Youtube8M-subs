00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.219 

this<00:02:01.760> defensively<00:02:02.420> what<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.900> do<00:02:03.020> they're

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
this defensively what can you do they're

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.020 
this defensively what can you do they're
strong<00:02:03.680> enough<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:04.190> they<00:02:04.340> can<00:02:04.400> just<00:02:04.820> back

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
strong enough that they can just back

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.180 
strong enough that they can just back
you<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.420> over<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.020> over<00:02:06.080> again<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.530> get<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> lab

so<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:07.700> thought<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:08.330> were<00:02:08.509> aggressive

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
so we thought that if we were aggressive

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.660 
so we thought that if we were aggressive
starting<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> ball<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.700> might<00:02:11.090> work<00:02:12.670> it

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.590
