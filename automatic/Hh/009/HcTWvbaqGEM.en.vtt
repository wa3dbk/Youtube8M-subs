00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.720 

and<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:20.620> getting<00:03:20.860> another<00:03:20.920> piece<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.550> fabric

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
and then getting another piece of fabric

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.770 
and then getting another piece of fabric
to<00:03:22.030> complement<00:03:22.569> your<00:03:22.720> work<00:03:24.420> place<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.660> on

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
there and just cut it out slightly

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.890 
there and just cut it out slightly
larger<00:03:29.459> about<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.490> millimeter<00:03:31.209> larger<00:03:31.630> all<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
larger about a millimeter larger all the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.390 
larger about a millimeter larger all the
way<00:03:31.990> around<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> edge

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.610 

so<00:03:36.060> trim<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.390> again<00:03:36.659> a<00:03:36.690> little<00:03:36.810> bit<00:03:37.170> there<00:03:39.620> and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so trim it again a little bit there and

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.100 
so trim it again a little bit there and
then<00:03:40.830> setting<00:03:41.519> your<00:03:41.670> machine<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.299> its<00:03:42.450> widest

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
then setting your machine on its widest

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.649 
then setting your machine on its widest
zigzag<00:03:43.349> again<00:03:45.409> and<00:03:46.849> I'm<00:03:47.849> still<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.269> free

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
zigzag again and I'm still in free

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.630 
zigzag again and I'm still in free
motion<00:03:49.080> mode<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.739> can<00:03:49.950> move<00:03:50.099> backwards

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
motion mode so that I can move backwards

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.899 
motion mode so that I can move backwards
and<00:03:50.730> forwards<00:03:51.269> I'm<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.440> zigzag<00:03:52.909> around

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
and forwards I'm going to zigzag around

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:00.230 
and forwards I'm going to zigzag around
the<00:03:54.360> edge

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.700 

cuts<00:04:01.240> off<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.570> ends<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.140> threads<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.530> they

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
cuts off the ends of the threads so they

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.020 
cuts off the ends of the threads so they
don't<00:04:02.920> get<00:04:03.040> punched<00:04:03.310> around<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.730> front<00:04:03.910> of

don't get punched around the front of
the<00:04:04.120> machine<00:04:06.270> machine<00:04:07.270> is<00:04:07.720> exact<00:04:08.140> all<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.500> way

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
the machine machine is exact all the way

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.320 
the machine machine is exact all the way
around<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:09.010> edge<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.400> can<00:04:09.550> cut<00:04:09.850> off<00:04:10.090> just

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
around the edge you can cut off just

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.600 
around the edge you can cut off just
trim<00:04:10.630> off<00:04:10.750> any<00:04:10.930> hairy<00:04:11.920> bits<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.430> are
