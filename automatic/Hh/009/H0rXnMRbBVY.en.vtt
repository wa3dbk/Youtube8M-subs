 Hello to you mak rodarte videoblog 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.170
 dedicated to apple products 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.240
 today we compare two fresh telephone 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.050
 Apple's flagship iphone 6 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.090
 and the first ever apple tablet 6 years 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.400
 let's start the dimensions and weights are the thinnest 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.470
 smartphones in the history of apple when 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.680
 dimensions 67 by one hundred thirty eight 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.320
 millimeters thickness i background 6 total 69 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.000
 millimeter record numbers not 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.460
 much wider iphone 6 plus 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 its thickness is only 1 millimeter 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.540
 dimensions of almost seventy eight to one hundred 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.000
 fifty eight millimeters 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.940
 because of this thickness the universal began 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.910
 hysteria with attempts to bend iphone 6 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.670
 plus despite record breaking thickness 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.070
 new iPhones heavier than all previous 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.230
 iphone 6 versions weighs one hundred twenty 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.570
 nine grams and iphone 6 plus one hundred 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.030
 seventy two grams as for 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 Convenience both gadgets have rounded 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.149
 the edges 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.690
 despite its size lie in hand like 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.020
 slabs 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.630
 Now about the size of the screen diagonal 4 7 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.610
 inch iphone 6 holds much 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 more information than 4-inch screen 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 for virgins at the same time due 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.930
 streamlining can be quite convenient 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.450
 manage and with one hand to improve 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.119
 ergonomics designer apple transferred 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.220
 button on the side but not worth 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.430
 worry accustomed to the historical 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.909
 the location of this key above is necessary 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.950
 just getting used to turn on the phone not 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.659
 index and thumb in 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.380
 further it will not cause any 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.900
 discomfort 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.689
 as for the iphone 6 plus 5 diagonal 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.150
 inches it is quite rightly called 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.430
 Fablet pocket tablet but in 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.649
 unlike ipad it is much more 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.810
 Compact and more comfortable to carry around. 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.180
 contrary to individual complaints and even 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 jeering we have seen in practice that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.860
 iphone 6 plus can be controlled 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.530
 one-handed invaluable help here 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.560
 will have the function of ricci to whiten and twice 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.299
 I click on the home button the whole interface 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.520
 wraps up yes half the screen so 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.709
 that you can reach the top two buttons 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.619
 not using the second hand but first 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.409
 turn 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.690
 it will appreciate the fans of the big screen on 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.670
 iphone 6 plus fits more content 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.250
 it is very convenient to read on it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.530
 video play do not type text 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.480
 iphone 6 plus big screen 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.379
 high resolution among all smartphones 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.120
 apple 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.010
 come on hd which is 1080 on 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 1920 pixels 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.909
 indicators have usually sixes slightly 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.799
 modest resolution 4 7 inch screen 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:42.620
 is 750 by 1334 pixels go 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.640
 to the stuffing iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus has 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.420
 64 bit dual core processor a8 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.060
 1 and 4 GHz frequency coprocessor m 8 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.209
 and 1 gigabyte of RAM now 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.340
 using the benchmark we will check different 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.349
 whether the performance of new iPhones 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 despite the slight differences you can 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.030
 call 6 and 6 plus the fastest on 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.370
 currently apple all smartphones 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.819
 programs quickly open any games 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.519
 fly faster react takachidi it's time 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.989
 talk about such important indicators as 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.329
 battery life 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.970
 All the more so with the new iPhones with this all 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.709
 okay on the presentation apple assured 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.590
 iphone 6 works offline 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.959
 250 hours, that is 10 days 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.669
 iphone 6 plus will hold on as many as six 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.129
 days more record in 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.799
 three hundred eighty four hours in 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.190
 reality is all the sadder iphone 6 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.709
 under normal use lives about 18 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.049
 hours and iphone 6 plus thanks to its 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.599
 big battery can stretch in two 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.370
 times the work time is very strong 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.829
 depends on the applications that you 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.160
 use as well as your connection 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.350
 cellular or wifi network 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.320
 In any case, both new devices with 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.660
 versions of 802 showed much more 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.280
 running time than iphone 5s costs 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.750
 talk about new features for 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.910
 lovers filed background 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.430
 matrix size of both iPhones 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.500
 still 8 megapixels nonetheless 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.600
 no improvements added 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.650
 software part manual tuning 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.930

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.510
 time lapse mode improved mode 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.670
 panoramas with a resolution of 43 megapixels 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.590
 the ability to shoot full hd video from 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.630
 a frequency of 60fps and words with a frequency of 240 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.400
 frames per second but optical 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.590
 only 6 plus has stabilization 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.290
 thanks to this function, even the morning 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.840
 Trevor does not hurt to make clear photos 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.000
 stabilization reduces soul vibration during 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.380
 photo time 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.500
 wiggle pictures on video and even 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.810
 low light in general more 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.100
 quality photos with even smaller 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.440
 effort on your part 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.680
 summarize we do not undertake to assert 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.610
 which of the new iPhones is better here all 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.800
 it depends on you 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.470
 if you have long been staring at large 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.990
 screens for example for reading games and 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.840
 watching videos in excellent quality 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.700
 iphone 6 plus definitely wins but 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.400
 if you always called big screens 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.630
 choose iphone 6 with shovels 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.669
 inferior to his brother in 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.500
 performance has very good 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.140
 battery life and excellent 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.960
 but on the quality of the photo and video shooting 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.900
 degree of ease of wearing management gives 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.120
 with . forward to your big brother you
