00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 and so there are plenty enough 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.140
 Many ways to clean gold in 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.650
 home conditions will be the first way 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.030
 use a glass of milk is cool what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.830
 milk a glass of water and a teaspoon 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.859
 liquid soap is offered either by some 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.220
 teaspoon dishwashing products 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.060
 we will put all this in a saucepan on the bottom 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 saucepans 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 put a soft cloth on a rag 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 gold and put somewhere this whole 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.690
 the structure consisting of the pan glass 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.790
 water into her spoons of detergent and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 gold on a rag somewhere minutes 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.649
 five to ten will boil 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 and so in the pot we have a half 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 glasses of water and a half teaspoons 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:56.899
 dishwashing liquid aos lemon and we 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 gold we lay down ours and in this whole capacity 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.409
 I have not cleaned gold for a long time 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 about a year exactly and now we turn 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.540
 tile out there still, our 510 birds 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.540
 brew boil mark time 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.090
 five minutes we will boil or 7 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.640
 We can look sick at the fire now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 let down a little 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.119
 put on Pyaterochka boil we 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.870
 our gold is about 8 minutes now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.490
 fill it up will wash everything cold 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.980
 my and then we calculate with a soft cloth 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.850
 by the way I advise you to use for 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.500
 some economic needs like that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.630
 cloths like the rescue for her 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.390
 can wash it can be reusable 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.520
 use for dry and wet cleaning 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.280
 very convenient to use 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.120
 take our little gold and dry it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.780
 wiped 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:06.220
 In a rag I think the result is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:11.180
 glittered gold glittered glittered 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.620
 began to shimmer with all the yellow flowers 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.080
 rainbows glittered 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.000
 you looked like it glitters hundred 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.930
 percent so now we are cross 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 life-giving we clean and in principle 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.420
 See my friends method of cleansing gold 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 in such conditions he gave results 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.739
 gold began to fly look 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.190
 overflowed with really fresh yellow 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.190
 by color
