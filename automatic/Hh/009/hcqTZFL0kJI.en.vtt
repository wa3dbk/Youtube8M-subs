00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
three and my eyes are still red they're

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.449 
three and my eyes are still red they're
very<00:02:45.880> sensitive<00:02:46.569> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.410> light<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:48.040> mean<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
very sensitive to the light I mean it

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.770 
very sensitive to the light I mean it
really<00:02:48.940> hurts<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.160> right<00:02:51.550> here<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.120> still

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
really hurts this I right here I still

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.949 
really hurts this I right here I still
can't<00:02:53.550> see<00:02:54.550> very<00:02:54.819> well<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.420> it

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
can't see very well out of it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.860 
can't see very well out of it
I<00:02:56.640> assume<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.910> have<00:02:58.000> scratched<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
I assume that I have scratched the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.750 
I assume that I have scratched the
cornea<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> surface<00:03:02.760> superficial

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
cornea which is a surface superficial

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.430 
cornea which is a surface superficial
surface<00:03:04.770> damage<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:08.050> gonna<00:03:08.200> put<00:03:08.410> my

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
surface damage and I'm gonna put my

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.070 
surface damage and I'm gonna put my
patch<00:03:08.740> back<00:03:09.069> on<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.670> won't<00:03:10.000> keep<00:03:10.240> blinking

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
patch back on so I won't keep blinking

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.220 
patch back on so I won't keep blinking
my<00:03:11.470> eye<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.720> kept<00:03:13.720> blinking<00:03:14.080> my<00:03:14.200> eye

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
my eye I think I kept blinking my eye

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.229 
my eye I think I kept blinking my eye
and<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.770> scratched<00:03:15.100> my<00:03:15.340> cornea

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and it scratched my cornea

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.780 
and it scratched my cornea
so<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.569> see<00:03:17.750> how<00:03:17.900> red<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.319> is<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:19.549> Reds

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
so you can see how red it is the Reds

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.199 
so you can see how red it is the Reds
not<00:03:20.060> really<00:03:20.390> going<00:03:20.659> away<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:24.049> I'm<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:25.209> I'm

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
on my third day so I'm really hoping

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.089 
on my third day so I'm really hoping
that<00:03:28.159> this<00:03:29.030> will<00:03:29.180> heal<00:03:29.360> up<00:03:29.569> very<00:03:29.780> soon<00:03:32.739> now<00:03:33.739> I'm
