what they want to see and for most of
them<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.280> got<00:00:11.610> online<00:00:11.880> strategies<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.799> I

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
them I got online strategies so here I

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.589 
them I got online strategies so here I
am<00:00:13.950> giving<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.730> an<00:00:14.790> online<00:00:15.000> strategies<00:00:15.360> video

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
am giving you an online strategies video

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.200 
am giving you an online strategies video
so<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.529> every<00:00:16.980> course<00:00:17.250> there<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.760> obvious

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
so in every course there are obvious

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
so in every course there are obvious
trap<00:00:18.449> spot<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.410> no<00:00:19.680> real<00:00:19.949> way<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
trap spot but there is no real way to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
trap spot but there is no real way to
make<00:00:20.550> someone<00:00:20.880> hit<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> partner

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
make someone hit them but with a partner

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710 
make someone hit them but with a partner
there<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> way<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.210> hit<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> drum

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there is a way to make them hit the drum

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
there is a way to make them hit the drum
so<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:25.949> we've<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.160> storm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so on are me see here we've got storm

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
so on are me see here we've got storm
ian<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> ken<00:00:27.720> falling<00:00:28.170> right<00:00:28.380> after

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
ian first and ken falling right after

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
ian first and ken falling right after
Kent<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.189> dragging<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:29.640> item<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> stormy<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
Kent is dragging an item and stormy is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
Kent is dragging an item and stormy is
the<00:00:31.410> trapper<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> racer<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.880> usually<00:00:33.000> be

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the trapper so a racer would usually be

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
the trapper so a racer would usually be
cautious<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.899> take<00:00:34.200> tight<00:00:34.469> lines<00:00:34.739> right

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cautious and not take tight lines right

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
cautious and not take tight lines right
behind<00:00:35.850> sound<00:00:36.210> let's<00:00:36.329> trailing<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:36.809> item<00:00:37.140> so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
behind sound let's trailing an item so

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
behind sound let's trailing an item so
they<00:00:38.070> tend<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:38.579> wide<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.840> this

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
they tend to go wide but with this

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.229 
they tend to go wide but with this
strategy<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.210> can

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
strategy what you can do is you can

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
strategy what you can do is you can
predict<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> place<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.829> item<00:00:44.040> wide

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
predict that and place an item wide

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
predict that and place an item wide
right<00:00:44.969> after<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> blind<00:00:45.750> turn<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.559> are

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
right after a blind turn so they are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.750 
right after a blind turn so they are
bound<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.610> hit<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:49.309> here's<00:00:50.309> another<00:00:50.489> example

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
bound to hit it here's another example

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
bound to hit it here's another example
of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.930> strategy<00:00:52.680> except<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> first

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of the same strategy except on the first

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.740 
of the same strategy except on the first
turn<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> Delfino<00:00:54.960> square<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:57.300> kick<00:00:57.449> off<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
turn of Delfino square to kick off the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.720 
turn of Delfino square to kick off the
next<00:00:57.960> set<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> online<00:00:58.469> strategies<00:00:58.920> we've<00:00:59.370> got

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
next set of online strategies we've got

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
next set of online strategies we've got
the<00:01:00.000> draft<00:01:00.270> strats<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> over<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.190> I've<00:01:02.399> got

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the draft strats so over here I've got

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.789

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
remote the fastest lap strat is to use

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.109 
remote the fastest lap strat is to use
the<00:01:11.970> mushroom<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> banister<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.409> cut<00:01:13.890> off

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
the mushroom on the banister and cut off

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.090 
the mushroom on the banister and cut off
part<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.659> banister<00:01:16.290> itself<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
part of the banister itself and just

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.969 
part of the banister itself and just
land<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> escalator<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.830> as

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
land on the top of the escalator so as

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.070 
land on the top of the escalator so as
you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.759> i<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.270> behind<00:01:21.630> aruba

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you can see here i just get behind aruba

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
you can see here i just get behind aruba
get<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> draft<00:01:23.130> hop<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> banister<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
get a draft hop on to the banister and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.840 
get a draft hop on to the banister and
just<00:01:26.610> drive<00:01:26.909> away<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:29.070> next<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
just drive away this next one here is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
just drive away this next one here is
basically<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.299> same<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> last<00:01:31.170> one

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
basically the same thing as the last one

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.880 
basically the same thing as the last one
but<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.460> banister<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.900> past<00:01:34.200> room<00:01:34.590> spot

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
but this banister is just past room spot

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.319 
but this banister is just past room spot
same<00:01:35.880> concept<00:01:36.479> same<00:01:37.200> difficulty<00:01:37.740> level<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
same concept same difficulty level and

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
same concept same difficulty level and
same<00:01:39.329> result<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.310> those<00:01:41.400> razors<00:01:41.820> had<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
same result so for those razors had a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
same result so for those razors had a
less<00:01:42.210> experienced<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> Cooper<00:01:43.409> case

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
less experienced with the Cooper case

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
less experienced with the Cooper case
rimless<00:01:43.979> cut<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> an<00:01:44.880> alternative<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
rimless cut there is an alternative and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350 
rimless cut there is an alternative and
it's<00:01:46.200> using<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> draft<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.759> manage<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.149> get

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's using a draft if you manage to get

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
it's using a draft if you manage to get
behind<00:01:48.479> someone<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.229> pull<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> draft<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
behind someone and pull a draft out you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
behind someone and pull a draft out you
can<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.090> hop<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.689> left<00:01:52.020> bring<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.560> your

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
can just hop to the left bring up your

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
can just hop to the left bring up your
really<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.189> quick<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.610> make<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> shroom

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
really really quick and make the shroom

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.310 
really really quick and make the shroom
was<00:01:54.960> cut<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.380> Cooper<00:01:55.740> cape

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
was cut on Cooper cape

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.649 
was cut on Cooper cape
this<00:01:57.680> next<00:01:57.950> one<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.520> pretty<00:01:58.909> simple<00:01:59.330> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
this next one here is pretty simple and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.240 
this next one here is pretty simple and
I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.440> know<00:02:00.470> what<00:02:00.770> we're<00:02:00.920> going<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.130> do

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
I think you know what we're going to do

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.180 
I think you know what we're going to do
I'm<00:02:01.460> drafting<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:02.150> rubra<00:02:02.479> right<00:02:02.690> now<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:03.190> right

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm drafting a rubra right now and right

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.640 
I'm drafting a rubra right now and right
where<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.820> off-road<00:02:05.420> needs<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.990> road

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
where the off-road needs to the road

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.029 
where the off-road needs to the road
itself<00:02:07.010> I<00:02:07.479> perform<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.539> hop<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.619> managed<00:02:10.009> to

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
itself I perform a hop and I managed to

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.970 
itself I perform a hop and I managed to
cut<00:02:10.369> off<00:02:10.399> at<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.990> go<00:02:12.230> through<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> shortcut

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
cut off at and I go through the shortcut

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.360 
cut off at and I go through the shortcut
pretty<00:02:13.280> smooth<00:02:14.320> this<00:02:15.320> next<00:02:15.620> strategy<00:02:15.920> here<00:02:16.340> is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
pretty smooth this next strategy here is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.500 
pretty smooth this next strategy here is
known<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.690> has<00:02:17.810> been<00:02:18.020> done<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.440> um<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:20.240> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
known and it has been done for um so I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.620 
known and it has been done for um so I
just<00:02:21.130> substitute<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.580> shroom<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.390> ghost

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
just substitute the shroom on ghost

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.020 
just substitute the shroom on ghost
valley<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> draft<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.580> able<00:02:25.850> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
valley to with a draft and I'm able to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.410 
valley to with a draft and I'm able to
make<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.420> shortcut<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:28.580> next<00:02:28.820> one<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.300> is

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
make the shortcut this next one here is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.650 
make the shortcut this next one here is
on<00:02:29.600> rainbow<00:02:29.989> road<00:02:30.230> instead<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:32.000> moon<00:02:32.300> jumping

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
on rainbow road instead of moon jumping

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.540 
on rainbow road instead of moon jumping
with<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> shroom<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.739> can<00:02:33.860> simply<00:02:34.040> moon<00:02:34.370> joke

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
with the shroom you can simply moon joke

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.030 
with the shroom you can simply moon joke
with<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> draft<00:02:35.000> it's<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:36.470> easy<00:02:36.709> setup

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
with the draft it's really easy setup

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.070 
with the draft it's really easy setup
just<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.030> hop<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.900> will<00:02:39.170> be<00:02:39.320> fine<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.900> we've

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
just a hop and you will be fine so we've

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.890 
just a hop and you will be fine so we've
got<00:02:42.230> mushroom<00:02:42.560> gorge<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.300> again<00:02:44.300> it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
got mushroom gorge here and again it's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.750 
got mushroom gorge here and again it's
the<00:02:45.230> very<00:02:45.530> first<00:02:45.620> room<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> app<00:02:46.489> flap

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the very first room of the app flap

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.750 
the very first room of the app flap
strategy<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:48.050> would<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.410> get<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.920> draft<00:02:49.190> hop

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
strategy you would just get a draft hop

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.580 
strategy you would just get a draft hop
over<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.180> off<00:02:50.360> road<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.930> you'll<00:02:51.019> be<00:02:51.200> able<00:02:51.410> to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
over the off road and you'll be able to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.979 
over the off road and you'll be able to
access<00:02:51.769> those<00:02:52.370> two<00:02:52.580> mushrooms<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.510> left<00:02:53.720> over

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
access those two mushrooms the left over

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.000 
access those two mushrooms the left over
there<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.600> strategy<00:02:57.080> mainly<00:02:57.470> goes<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
there so this strategy mainly goes to

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
there so this strategy mainly goes to
the<00:02:58.100> more<00:02:58.280> experienced<00:02:58.940> glitchers<00:02:59.330> out<00:02:59.600> there

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the more experienced glitchers out there

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.350 
the more experienced glitchers out there
so<00:03:00.440> as<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.739> may<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.250> for<00:03:01.610> funky<00:03:01.910> Kong<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
so as you may know for funky Kong and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.970 
so as you may know for funky Kong and
flame<00:03:02.660> runner<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.380> generally<00:03:03.680> need<00:03:03.920> a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
flame runner you generally need a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.680 
flame runner you generally need a
mushroom<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.640> perform<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.060> shortcut<00:03:05.450> you

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
mushroom to perform the shortcut you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.570 
mushroom to perform the shortcut you
have<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.870> keep<00:03:05.989> in<00:03:06.170> mind<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.650> gain<00:03:07.220> speed

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
have to keep in mind that you gain speed

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.050 
have to keep in mind that you gain speed
and<00:03:07.900> you're<00:03:08.900> turning<00:03:09.260> angle<00:03:09.590> becomes<00:03:10.100> wider

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and you're turning angle becomes wider

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.479 
and you're turning angle becomes wider
right<00:03:12.780> here<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.080> Delfino<00:03:13.500> square<00:03:13.800> aruba<00:03:14.280> sets

up behind me as we both go to do the dot
cut<00:03:16.950> however<00:03:17.760> he<00:03:18.390> doesn't<00:03:18.660> take<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.110> one<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> do

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
cut however he doesn't take the one I do

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.500 
cut however he doesn't take the one I do
with<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.069> little<00:03:20.310> draft<00:03:20.550> boost<00:03:20.819> he<00:03:21.120> manages

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
with the little draft boost he manages

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.970 
with the little draft boost he manages
to<00:03:21.569> go<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.050> way<00:03:22.140> over<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.620> next<00:03:22.739> side

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
to go all the way over to the next side

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.410 
to go all the way over to the next side
with<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> strategy<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.090> actually<00:03:24.239> do

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
with the strategy you can actually do

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.030 
with the strategy you can actually do
the<00:03:24.569> Delfino<00:03:24.989> double<00:03:25.290> cut<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.620> only<00:03:25.830> once

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
the Delfino double cut with only once

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.930 
the Delfino double cut with only once
room<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.610> draft<00:03:28.099> so<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.340> next<00:03:29.489> segment<00:03:29.700> is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
room and a draft so this next segment is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.900 
room and a draft so this next segment is
actually<00:03:30.390> one<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.660> my<00:03:30.810> favorites<00:03:31.910> mainly

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
actually one of my favorites mainly

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:44.930 
actually one of my favorites mainly
because<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:42.170> yep<00:03:43.170> that's<00:03:43.560> right<00:03:43.940> 100cc

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
because of this yep that's right 100cc

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.970 
because of this yep that's right 100cc
the<00:03:45.630> reason<00:03:45.959> why<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.590> much<00:03:46.739> is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the reason why I like it so much is

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.680 
the reason why I like it so much is
because<00:03:47.010> if<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:47.940> know<00:03:48.090> these<00:03:48.269> strategies

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
because if you do know these strategies

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.490 
because if you do know these strategies
