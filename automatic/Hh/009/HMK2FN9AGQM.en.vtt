 hi to all these video site visits 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.859
 test.com today i'm going to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.540
 present the creator testons from at pic 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.830
 so the created one test the argument as 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 the business arguments that I'm given 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.790
 well he's a muscular guy from 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.160
 several pounds in six weeks a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 30 to 35% strength boost six weeks 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 a loss of 1 to 2 kg having six weeks 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 better nitrogen assimilation 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.510
 strengthening of life rieder 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.310
 strengthening the immune system and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.930
 better regeneration during 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.930
 sleep so let's check this 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.930
 then the creation of peak and well 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 it's a whole in twenty two of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.380
 ingredients which include the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 British vitamin yielded 3 who had 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.510
 two niacin vitamin b6 b12 a little you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.180
 have said calcium magnesium phosphorus etc 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 I had seen the timing of the taurine 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 sodium potassium here you have got 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.830
 lots of things some of which some 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 some things with dosages 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.310
 completely incomprehensible so voila 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.240
 if not after on the site as usual 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.280
 we put you a little bit of what serves 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 some some welcoming some 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.360
 nutrients tells you more so 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 do not hesitate to go see the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 articles it's really articles 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 complete what we do what we can not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 tell everything in video so that's it then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 otherwise on the use so normally 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.649
 it's 85 grams of powder of 4.2 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.690
 and in 250 milliliters of water and jesus 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.430
 complementary directly after 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.720
 morning workout on the days of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.720
 rest then 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:49.340
 we are here in the gay box 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:54.890
 to suffer then to have yielded white 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:59.759
 so for info I 'm going to watch 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.229
 I asked to be explained 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.640
 why there were capsules and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.420
 why there was powder in the end 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.929
 count the capsules contain all 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.510
 that there is a bad taste to allow 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:35.040
 the oral solution to have a taste a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 okay ok so I'm not going to mix 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.940
 a lot because it's not helpful so 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.569
 you see there is mud this name it's 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 a bit like in all mixtures 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.609
 there is a small amount of deposits but 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.390
 that's mostly due I think creative and 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.870
 it is that which not fall very well 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.890
 but there are a few deposits but 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.560
 it's not a problem when you have to drink it 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.190
 hd strong return so this is a complex 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.590
 lÃ¼thi source eligibility which is 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.460
 good as you could see and so 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.210
 the extract finally 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.330
 plant extracts everything there is a 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.710
 bad taste that in capsules this is where 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 had to think about it is still rather 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.750
 smart on the other hand in weak point 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 I would say the fact that there is too much 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.430
 of ingredients the fact that there are 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.160
 overdose also of some nutrients 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.490
 so my personal opinion and well despite 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.340
 despite that in so I tried to 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:40.090
 therefore produces the taste already and is rather 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.200
 good I lost weight quickly i 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.760
 had an improvement in quality 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.170
 muscular now the side I like 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 that's fine so that's it if you have 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.190
 if you have tried this product or what 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.780
 and well put comments and everything 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.360
 that and then that's if you have any 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.610
 information or if you want to know 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.920
 more it is you are writing as 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.730
 usually and then I tell you see you soon 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.730
 for a new test
