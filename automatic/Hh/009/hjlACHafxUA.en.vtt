00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
crack if you wait too long to do

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.830 
crack if you wait too long to do
whatever<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.060> need<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.240> do<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.570> does<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.330 
whatever you need to do it does it
actually<00:02:20.870> break<00:02:21.380> through<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.980> start<00:02:22.250> to

actually break through and you start to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.310 
actually break through and you start to
fall<00:02:22.490> eventually<00:02:23.150> start<00:02:23.600> chipping<00:02:23.780> away<00:02:24.110> and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
fall eventually start chipping away and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.620
