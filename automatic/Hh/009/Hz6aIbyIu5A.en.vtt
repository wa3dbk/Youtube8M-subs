00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.179
 hello guys this video is to tell you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:13.160
 I recommend that you say and write 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 airplane does not airplane the term 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 airplane comes from the French aeroplan 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.570
 whose origin is Latin and derives precisely 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 from air which means air and planus that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.830
 means flat in Italian today 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 most commonly we use the term 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.450
 airplane but be careful because plane 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.320
 hence the term we use 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.719
 to describe the medium that flies there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 door around brings us on vacation is not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.629
 the abbreviation of airplane but is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.010
 right in the end, therefore I am 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.620
 two different words plane and airplane 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 as many people think that the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.200
 aerial term is the abbreviation of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 airplane mistakenly write and say 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 airplane but so it was not so 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.250
 very careful not to commit this 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.159
 mistake the same goes for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 terms like aerobic airport 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:29.549
 aeronautics therefore they will not be an airport 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:32.280
 or aerial bica or aeronautics but it is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.280
 precisely of aero that is the first part of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 these words are aero and not aerial 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.509
 be very careful so airplane and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.720
 no airplane is said and written 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.310
 aerosol and non-aerosol therefore 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.350
 the appliance we use when 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.110
 we are sick, we have flu 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.990
 cough colds have been very much 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.149
 very very careful own airplane 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.159
 as you want it written in the title 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.439
 do lots of exercises on the site 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.569
 let's see where you put me like it 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.280
 facebook page by schematizing e 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.080
 also on the facebook page 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.080
