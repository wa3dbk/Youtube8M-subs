yo<00:00:07.200> guys<00:00:07.350> spider<00:00:07.740> here<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.130> got<00:00:08.370> another<00:00:08.910> audio

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
yo guys spider here we got another audio

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.709 
yo guys spider here we got another audio
log<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.050> second<00:00:10.500> audio<00:00:10.650> log<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.360> found

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
log the second audio log that we found

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.369 
log the second audio log that we found
here<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.620> laboratory<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.020> we're<00:00:16.020> sweet

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
here in the laboratory and we're sweet

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.730 
here in the laboratory and we're sweet
for<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.890> epic<00:00:17.570> 1,000<00:00:18.570> foot<00:00:18.750> robot<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.529> make

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
for that epic 1,000 foot robot to make

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
for that epic 1,000 foot robot to make
its<00:00:19.920> way<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.730> top<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.000> us<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.689> can

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
its way over top of us so we can

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.279 
its way over top of us so we can
actually<00:00:22.020> hear<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:23.430> hear<00:00:23.460> what's<00:00:24.330> being<00:00:24.750> said

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
actually hear to hear what's being said

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.400 
actually hear to hear what's being said
so<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> laboratory<00:00:26.779> it's<00:00:27.779> over<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.260> on

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
so in the laboratory it's over here on

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
so in the laboratory it's over here on
this<00:00:28.560> workbench<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this workbench and we're just going to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.560 
this workbench and we're just going to
hit<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.390> let's<00:00:30.779> listen<00:00:32.570> researching

of indeterminate origin it is my
hypothesis<00:00:50.820> however<00:00:51.390> outlandish<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.739> this

hypothesis however outlandish that this
transfer<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> matter<00:00:54.690> may<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.860> be

believe<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> answer<00:01:00.180> may<00:01:00.660> lay<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
believe the answer may lay with the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.270 
believe the answer may lay with the
broken<00:01:01.770> rune<00:01:02.160> stones<00:01:02.609> located<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> mound
