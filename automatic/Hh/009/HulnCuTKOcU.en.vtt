 open to open the video game 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.809
 We've already found a lot of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.719
 video out there on youtube or leave the link 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 for you a dowry games can access 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.230
 to know how to videogame good friend 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.580
 joseph freed 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 You can say that the following people 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 here is the connector on the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 videogame motherboard and a booklet that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.430
 we already cut and already I think 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 points of sale here have the tips of the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 already released as a connector on the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.099
 position that it is this and the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.620
 here in the part of the video game that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.059
 going to look this one had a search for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 have an idea of ​​the size I do not know it is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.140
 much smaller than on ps3 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 I put here a standard club of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 you see the size is much smaller than 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 that a usb club then you already are 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.480
 about how big you are. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.370
 will find the components 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.899
 We had difficulty peeling 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 uncut yarn 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.410
 You chose to cut and is in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.399
 ends to five years , and is already cut 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 easier 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.960
 this is the part is the kit with a lot 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 people call so that we will 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.000
 used to make this increase in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 speed of the cooler it is very simple it is 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 the cheapest ones we found 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.340
 I accompanied by 28 reais 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.540
 he has four pins here where people 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.229
 will connect the children he comes with a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.570
 connection scheme to do this is just the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 connection here has the screw 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.479
 that we will turn to be able to do the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.310
 club speed setting 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 according to our intention our 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 need and and here are the pins that the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.630
 people will use to make the connection 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.380
 So this is where the people go. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.720
 wait for the kit after it is installed 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.119
 is repairing and connecting here is a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.159
 floppy connector that I took from a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 Poor source, you see here. 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.970
 is when you get a kit is not this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.940
 or any other kit will have the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.550
 orientation of the position of the wires 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.300
 we found that it is best to do 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:05.010
 the red cable facing the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.400
 right as indicated in the agent manual 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.160
 Plug and connect here on the pins 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.270
 and from there we adapt the education 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.700
 which is in the manual because people 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 need here in the video game is one more 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 detail how these movies are a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.090
 short on one connected with 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 firmness that we had to give a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.540
 more plunged here at the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.220
 connector to spend a little bit it 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 makes a better connection but this is just one 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.410
 detail to be loose here and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.180
 cause trouble after the correct position 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 this kit will be here ó it will stay 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.610
 in this corner 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.530
 I'll do it now because it takes a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.790
 a little to be right people 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.270
 will show that they already in place after 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.910
 we will put it is that and realize 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:51.110
 that the son goes out here or behind 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:55.320
 already the videogame that gives access to the connector 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.650
 of good cooler so here you can see 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.780
 that we have the red thread coming 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.550
 of the kit only by making a victim of 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.010
 fishing we did not take the energy to 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.959
 power the kit in red for 12 volts 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.959
 here we have a thick wire of the kit 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.959
 that goes along to get the energy too 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.700
 feeding the kit and here the gray is 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.190
 that we really have to cut 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.280
 If you notice here, I'm cut off. 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.590
 I have the wire that comes from the kit a new course 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.470
 fact that here is not what comes from Plate 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.480
 this is what I get the normal landing of the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.040
 video game board and this is the yellow one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.140
 which is already coming with a new boost now 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.310
 accelerating healing that goes looking for as well 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.489
 then this is the only one that really 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.680
 cut to do the installation 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.820
 We'll sort this out later, okay? 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.040
 show you how it will be 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.239
 Tidy said place we can close 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.370
 after 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.310
 and you see how it finished good 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.460
 people who are installed can perceive 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.930
 The search is already spinning 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.500
 I'll show you how the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.850
 adjustment is here on the screw turned to the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.960
 right 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.960
 speed increases 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.760
 the turn to the left decreases 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.060
 it's not the ideal the idea is what you think 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.380
 better since you do not leave much 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.190
 accelerated for a fact of the 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.049
 and do not even make a loud sound because of 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.030
 early in the morning with silence at a 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.770
 too quiet you're going to bother a 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.330
 little the scenario then accelerates one 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.270
 bit to a level you think 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.250
 ideal, I'll leave here more or less 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.600
 on the level more or less and you're going 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.430
 realize that we can already 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.040
 improve quite so right now the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.470
 already installed with the finish of the 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.040
 wires made all neat if you look here 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.080
 It is the only repair kit connector 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.250
 install here in this corner and spacious 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.410
 I did it here 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.660
 here by the side and here is the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.260
 connector with the retractable system was 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.530
 tidy here so now it's basically 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.210
 close the video game and use everything 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.070
 Tidy that's on the other side here. 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.890
 the next advantage survey for 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.600
 show you will see in the cunene and the 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.560
 kit installed here on top of the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.900
 table 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.250
 he's here with the wires coming out there 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.250
 behind are these people
