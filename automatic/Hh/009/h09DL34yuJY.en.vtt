00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.960
 we are back and full of emotion 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.279
 full of sensations 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.109
 it's been good I jumped up here 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.350
 We could say 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.480
 to see what to do now 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.480
 we have here jump here in front 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.700
 of control so let's see if with 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.700
 this little eye 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 objectives in the we can give cane to see 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.899
 if I win this race the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.899
 digits and so many near the first 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 is unethical ethical verticality ended 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 a child makes guys are really cool it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 he knew that to go around here 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 now it will be necessary to turn again I suppose 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:14.790
 that will have to be released by the ramp that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:19.470
 accompanied by jumping over this one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 and tell me what came please 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 and this one 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 eye there is careful at least the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.840
 plane please 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.840
 perfect 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 a row of trees because others 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.370
 I honestly do not understand why 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.360
 this row of trees years but good 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.180
 which one is here will be because 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.330
 catch them we have it here in the middle 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.100
 and jump by looping rather not 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.100
 it makes sense that we do 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 this perfectÃ­simo taking care to explode 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.490
 careful to exploit I repeat I repeat 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.490
 take care there takes it 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:22.340
 it's not a fool that happens that you will see 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.210
 Everything tends to come calmly 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 quiet that we simply have to 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430
 get back here this time that 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 it's also worth project after we continue 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.450
 first to top of power life says when 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.880
 explore please almost almost exploded 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.990
 missed the hard canton worth positive 22 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.950
 points of five types of the two no longer 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.080
 he called half the race but 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.090
 we are giving of beating and that sincerely 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.440
 I'm really cool and it makes me stay 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.440
 pretty happy today 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.150
 wanda 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.689
 not the truth that if I had worn this 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.189
 very well to the next attempt we are going to 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.000
 It seems that this is going to be faster 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:06.840
 but I give you x up hand that already asks 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.840
 to the point of view as really 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.709
 we are still here for our but for 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.450
 our surpassed by another as if it were 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.400
 Imagine an airport for you 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 five planes for you only because to 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.500
 the key to life 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.500
 there are people jumping for the moment 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:34.510
 he gave me a push to life that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.300
 push to life company and that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 prototype with a bit did not come up either 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.950
 so to clear you it fell like 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.630
 a tortilla of guys there is us 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.820
 we go around the power cap 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.750
 let's go to one of motor boy days now 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.550
 yes yes to see if that called a 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.840
 very big speed and now yes change 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.160
 the point of carrying I say I go tell me 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.019
 Well, it seems that the point is 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.019
 they call the spot impeccable guys the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.209
 puntito impi diablito careful with the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.230
 very fast balsicas gentlemen 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:12.360
 for 105 signed 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.360
 It is perfect, no, no 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.730
 second checkpoints are missing twenty 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.140
 control points and eye because you go in 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.850
 the third what complicates the thing in 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.960
 when it seemed that we have everything 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.020
 controlled for now I have here behind 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 to the third and forward the first eye eye 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.010
 louse vouchers 29 point of 54 mega comes 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.290
 little jump of the big ones I think what 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.060
 I have badly executed the fatal execution or already 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.310
 I'm going to spend five meters 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.320
 nobody passed me the point guys told me 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.460
 what the kid was coming from 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 here if you want to reach perfectly 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.800
 too big a speed gave 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.180
 it came quiet and you take it tell me karachi 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.990
 that arrived please tell me yes 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.990
 please really did not really give 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:10.590
 at the moment of escape 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.590
 we brake fast here, it's good 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.060
 pegadito let's go here or hobby lobby 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.940
 brief 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.960
 well well well is behind pretty 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:28.650
 stuck thing that makes me pretty dense 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.110
 eye this what this this this what this 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.759
 OK 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:43.860
 but you do not have to go down magically 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:43.860
 it is missing enough 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.060
 it's very interesting around here is 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.810
 missing two control points are missing 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.009
 we actually go up and up and there 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.029
 is the goal I hope not to fail in the 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.029
 jump please dani 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.760
 it's amazing first finally let's go 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.800
 first at the beginning we have returned to 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.160
 trace back to surely time like this 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.160
 that nothing
