00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.290
 you know law and present and be 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.850
 welcome to this that is gay the five 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.849
 guards we are playing in the beta 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.620
 killer on the map of fruit and good we 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 we found that an underland boy goes 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 to let your present 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.480
 in the night of yesterday is the day and 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.600
 the truth is that we are very tired 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.640
 but 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.160
 to see the talks walking like every time 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 this is played because I was playing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.500
 I was playing a while ago 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 partied about 45 games with the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 boy of snoopy fut and honestly 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 I have a kiel of the king in negative 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 they are bringing as a rag they bring me as 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.930
 rag but so massively rape me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.239
 intensely and I can not do anything anymore 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.690
 call you and I cried then that we 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.690
 you recommend 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.120
 cry and cry 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.750
 ok I have taken the first step and we are going to 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.600
 help new seconds because that already 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.920
 I made that step and I did it a while ago and 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.190
 done also the first day that I played the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.930
 bird is helping but apparently I'm still 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.440
 being a garbage then what is the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.440
 second step 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.700
 because day 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.700
 nights hernán and is the second step 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 tell me 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.050
 if it is that we are talking because it has 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.950
 a base of the xbox band like this is 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.630
 excuse me I can not answer you no 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 I finish understanding 100 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.610
 you still liked it 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.630
 then it 's fun just screaming 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.630
 very fast 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.060
 it's very fast exactly if I 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.009
 always the same has as another 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.630
 dynamic in fact a while ago when 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.730
 I just started playing the first game 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.160
 of the day there was my brother here and I said 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.950
 beta look halo and that because the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.050
 disk is 2 years old and then told me 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.670
 It is half small and I said yes 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.220
 above all I also explained to him about the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.690
 default controls that you have 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.610
 right now I'm using the defaults 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.950
 and I explained it is more or less than with the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.410
 that I pointed out before, now you crouch 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.020
 and things like that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 well, as it changes all the dynamics of 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.280
 what is the game itself did not say that 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.100
 it was bad or not good because obviously 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 he even played nothing else saw him play it but 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.370
 yes he commented to me but he also commented that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.050
 he felt like he was changed 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.260
 totally dynamic and that the maps 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.110
 they were very big but it is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.630
 question I think to get used to 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 although I do not know I do not know honestly if 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.950
 I can get used to it because 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.160
 sincerely I've been playing and has not 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.600
 there was not a game that I got well 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.190
 the streak kills the truth is that 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.960
 then they have been me but rapping and 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.270
 I think you can in the next 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.520
 example that we are friends because I am 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.000
 changing a bit because a serious mistake 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.770
 that I realized some time ago I left 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.240
 go as well as for example in rich gel 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.760
 in kill the witch then to a certain 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.520
 point you can tell by the map and you can 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.410
 Go rapping there is one that prono batillo 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.560
 in this game I feel that as a theme 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.050
 so very fast you do not have that possibility 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.420
 so 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.910
 is on the one hand that part is fine 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.470
 it's okay that he kills fast but for 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.230
 another part is also strange 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.210
 another thing that I also do not know if it's 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.319
 good if it's bad is for example when 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.390
 you're running and you can not 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.909
 and reload the shields I know that if you go 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.739
 running you do not recharge your shields 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.569
 I do not know if it's good if it's bad 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.219
 a part is good because that's the way 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.709
 Rat children, they do not escape for you 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.989
 keep running and everything when you 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.849
 put all your life and go running 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.769
 but on the other hand, when you are 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.090
 rapping when there is a good team by 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:25.930
 say so of the opponent is of 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:25.930
 those who then in general 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.080
 I do not like it 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.420
 but hey keeps me entertained and that 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.140
 yes it's fun this funny the 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.390
 they add more maps because I also like 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.170
 that maps are a bit bored nests 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.170
 they are going to add 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.210
 it's okay it's okay to use every 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.360
 week is perfect but well that's how it is 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.090
 as you see here and I started more or less well 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.920
 and right now they are rapping us and 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.770
 some reason I always play in teams 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.170
 rare where the opponents to me 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.170
 They are very crazy or I do not know if it is very 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.569
 clean rather I leave more line than I am 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.069
 a toll advance 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.110
 and it does not feel like sometimes 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.419
 teams are not like that balanced or 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.819
 I do not know if it's because they come obviously 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.629
 if you have a team or because everyone is more 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:41.449
 easy more and everything but when we try 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.789
 look for the first days obviously of the 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.199
 last video of the halo beta 5 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.819
 it took us a good to find 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.830
 starting now castilla is a bit 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:53.959
 better find look for a loner 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.610
 so I just got in and found 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.289
 quite fast sincerely and prevents 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.729
 search with hernán also found 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.309
 fast but I was with the 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.809
 stop and it took us like 20 minutes in 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.779
 find each game before this table 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:06.529
 I miss the game intensely but I 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.229
 I think you have to give it a chance 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.050
 more than anyone I will compare listeners 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.750
 and I'm buying for the campaign 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.050
 campaign the story and all this 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.370
 the master chief and is dated the 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.990
 shelves that are going to be removed because 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.270
 That's how I'm interested here more and 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.830
 also to upload it in video and everything and 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.890
 already in the manifold and I think that once 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.960
 that comes out depending on how much you 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:34.490
 invest of the time that such is not possible 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.220
 lead to dependence if it continues or if in 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.660
 that honestly because then if always 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.480
 they are going to be breaking like this 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.030
 well, it does not have much to follow 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.360
 unless they do as some series the 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.030
 world to be a hero or something like that but 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.270
 honestly it would be boring I say 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.800
 I'm going to always there is losing I do not know 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.080
 what will be bring as a rag see what 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.060
 I do not know what happened, no, come on 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.320
 I know that several who are watching this 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.880
 video you have already played 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.669
 because the beta is now available 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.160
 It was available since 29 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.140
 December for all those who had the 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.280
 mallet your projection so leave here 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.990
 down in the comments that the 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.000
 disappeared until they inhabit if it has 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.680
 liked if you did not like things 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.080
 good our bad obviously has 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.139
 of the two 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.430
 but this to a certain extent is like 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:23.919
 point of view also boy hernán 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.129
 gave a little bit your point of view here what 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.169
 shared and leave tips leave tips for 

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:30.849
 that he does not know what this newbie is because 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:34.400
 As it sells, they put it in and I 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:39.410
 They are matt and matt and mate and mate and mate 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:42.440
 and I think a tip to a certain extent 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.970
 it has changed a bit more although it does not 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.970
 deprive of certain 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.990
 well, nothing friends we reached the end of 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.340
