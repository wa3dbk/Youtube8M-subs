just trim off the excess pieces so we

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.460 
just trim off the excess pieces so we
will<00:01:39.369> start<00:01:39.700> by<00:01:39.909> adhering<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.540> blue<00:01:40.869> pattern

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
will start by adhering the blue pattern

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:52.330 
will start by adhering the blue pattern
paper<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.130> top<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.970> cart

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.350 

we're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> create<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.570> card<00:01:56.329> on<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
we're going to create the card on the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.639 
we're going to create the card on the
vertical<00:01:58.579> rather<00:01:59.579> than<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> horizontal<00:02:00.649> but

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
vertical rather than the horizontal but

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.859 
vertical rather than the horizontal but
this<00:02:01.860> card<00:02:02.189> design<00:02:02.549> could<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.939> flipped<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
this card design could be flipped if you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.749 
this card design could be flipped if you
prefer<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> way

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
prefer it that way

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
prefer it that way
so<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> bottom<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.049> card<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.590> are

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
so now at the bottom of the card we are

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.969 
so now at the bottom of the card we are
going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.519> a<00:02:08.910> strip<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.420> this

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
going to use a strip of this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.140 
going to use a strip of this

swirl pattern paper reason why I like

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.710 
swirl pattern paper reason why I like
the<00:02:20.760> 6x6<00:02:21.269> pads<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.120> get<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the 6x6 pads is because you can get the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330

same patterns that you love in our

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.090 
same patterns that you love in our
larger<00:02:26.790> paper<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.670> smaller<00:02:31.100> pattern

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
larger paper but it is a smaller pattern

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.729 
larger paper but it is a smaller pattern
size<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.330> makes<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.810> perfect<00:02:34.319> for<00:02:34.530> things

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
size so that makes it perfect for things

and<00:02:46.650> then<00:02:47.519> I'll<00:02:47.849> come<00:02:48.180> back<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.959> card<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and then I'll come back on the card and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.339 
and then I'll come back on the card and
actually<00:02:50.480> mark<00:02:51.480> where<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.690> need<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.930> cut<00:02:52.230> it

foundation of this card the next part

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.860 
foundation of this card the next part
we're<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.459> do<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.030> we're<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.630> use

we're going to do is we're going to use

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.590 
we're going to do is we're going to use
the<00:03:04.079> element<00:03:04.650> stickers<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.970> we're<00:03:06.209> going<00:03:06.420> to

this second tree we're actually going to

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.030 
this second tree we're actually going to
use<00:03:31.260> some<00:03:31.500> adhesive<00:03:31.730> foam<00:03:33.019> circles<00:03:34.019> now<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
don't have to cover the entire piece

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.729 
don't have to cover the entire piece
just<00:03:50.519> enough<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.090> when<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.530> will

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
just enough that when it is on it will

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.080 
just enough that when it is on it will
lie<00:03:53.720> straight<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.310> let's<00:03:56.459> peel<00:03:56.730> off<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
lie straight so let's peel off the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.080 
lie straight so let's peel off the
backing

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
backing

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.720

and<00:03:58.209> now<00:03:58.810> we're<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.230> slightly<00:04:00.130> overlap

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
and now we're going to slightly overlap

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.050 
and now we're going to slightly overlap
that<00:04:01.650> second<00:04:02.650> tree<00:04:02.860> on<00:04:03.069> top<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> first

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
that second tree on top of the first

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.870 
that second tree on top of the first
tree<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:05.530> one<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.010> things<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.550> do

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
tree now one of the things I like to do

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.690 
tree now one of the things I like to do
to<00:04:07.060> add<00:04:07.209> some<00:04:07.540> dimension<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.709> distress<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
to add some dimension is to distress the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.850 
to add some dimension is to distress the
edges<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:10.239> my<00:04:10.360> projects<00:04:10.989> with<00:04:11.500> some<00:04:11.680> Brown

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
edges of my projects with some Brown

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.949 
edges of my projects with some Brown
stamping<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:12.760> get<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.000> color<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.510> stamping

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
stamping so get the color of stamping

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.500

pigment brown ink and then just by
rubbing<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.500> edges<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.720> come<00:04:22.930> in<00:04:23.050> a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
rubbing the edges you can come in a

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.570 
rubbing the edges you can come in a
little<00:04:23.230> bit<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.040> corners

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
little bit more on the corners
