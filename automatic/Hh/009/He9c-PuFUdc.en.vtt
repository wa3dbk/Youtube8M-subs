00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.330
 By the way, getting back to know by the way here 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 youtube as I promised 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.719
 I answer your comments today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.610
 Let's start right now do it ev 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 writes this tip with 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.830
 indirect advertising even in our 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 channel 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 Of course he works on his 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.240
 Channel are to run the clearing are 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.949
 So a 100% guarantee 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 Of course I can not go to you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.130
 probably very big that it 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.510
 but usually works 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.720
 of course this works 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.859
 also on your channel no fear 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.230
 You could compete for a video 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.910
 about profession and youtube do so whether it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
 disadvantages in professional life there 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
 maybe that's why it's not taken 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.489
 or something depends on what you for 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 do videos and we where you 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.149
 I do not want to apply now 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.879
 necessarily say that it is disadvantageous to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.200
 to make youtube videos later 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.840
 get a job somewhere 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 that's not quite true so i work 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 yes, and my boss for example the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 It totally does not matter what I do and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.469
 also watches the videos 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.870
 like the younger generation 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 is like then behaves later 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 if they have work later 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.090
 I can learn here but there would be 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 I do not hire some 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.439
 I would rather have german 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
 inquires and writes hey could 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.650
 you have to weigh in a video for what 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.450
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.860
 if you show up on the internet if you are 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 have more argument than just something like 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.369
 the audience is recognizable on the street 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.080
 and the like, I could 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 not decide though I do not have one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 counter arguments 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 love greetings so it can be done before 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 and disadvantages therefore have an advantage over 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.490
 me now if you for example one 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.829
 extremely good talent has a little less 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.270
 For example, sing or sing well 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.270
 Soja singing really well 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 I am the getmobile de pol 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:51.119
 I 've got it off and I'm horny yo yo me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 have moni then you can for example 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.009
 also be discovered and then you can 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.869
 also be really successful or 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.729
 I find a acting school 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.409
 can be possible and then want the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
 de haan or so far and the nato and the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.369
 disadvantages of course if you are so of course 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.110
 somehow make people bad or something 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.810
 on youtube is just about hate or something 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.039
 only make videos and you did that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.959
 always needs a bad light 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.430
 you and if you are still recognized 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.860
 then times can happen and you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 the vsg himself that his lips or 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 so nadolski writes a long 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.920
 comment a question i would like too 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480
 Start with videos on youtube where I am 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.280
 so comedy wants to do and the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.510
 people want to entertain and therefore 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.459
 I wanted to ask you are you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.890
 actually other youtube or youtuber 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.510
 the new ones are support and help 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.680
 because you can do it alone or 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 you do not do something like that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.769
 love the way I am steak 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.030
 it is h 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.560
 you have views from me again 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.959
 and commented and funny from miley 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.989
 that is also a very good question and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.389
 that is always depends on what 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.400
 make the people for videos when they go to 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.170
 example really well edited videos 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.489
 then of course that is then go 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.269
 it also takes time and writes 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.760
 also a comment 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 Of course it can also be that there 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.239
 now, for example, not so good 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.160
 video is yes then I write there helps 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.310
 a few tips on how to improve the video 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.079
 or so it helps 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.510
 Maybe yes, I'll help you there 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.239
 a bit but now push so directly 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.069
 it did not really look right 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.829
 shit could be in this or supplies 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.780
 the videos are so cool that it is 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.889
 is it worth shedding somehow and that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.480
 to give it a little further then 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.669
 I would also a buddy 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.620
 give their larger channel and ask if 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:29.609
 he can judge the x lion and then 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.440
 he does that was mostly that too 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.970
 is rather rare just becomes 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.419
 asserting always depends on what 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.190
 you're doing it if it's right 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.380
 is extraordinary then you have 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.900
 Of course, a chance of success is very 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.750
 it is something very big 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.729
 make millions of people or soya then 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.819
 is rather low and it always comes up 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.499
 the processing 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.900
 as the video quality has blablabla 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:55.749
 All this fucking so that's great 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.760
 Glad 530 wonders how can I get down 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.920
 show something or how can I do that 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.889
 video on break please turn to help 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.260
 so this is for example the question at 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.989
 I am now myself if you are 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.930
 the question is what does he mean now 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.219
 below which indeed get an insight to the bottom well 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.900
 show in the video 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.660
 in the video directly even if over 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.190
 cut or at youtube that is 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.099
 Now the key question and how you 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.750
 the video can pause yes 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.729
 you press down on this button and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.020
 then on break there was often a break 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.360
 do or do I have there now I 've got 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.150
 No action I have no idea what 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 you're ferrari for that question me 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.949
 Stupid Gaming 22 wrote the commentary to me 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.199
 have a question how to get to one 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.300
 names like container or unplayed then 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.330
 how to play the name unplayed 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.530
 and that he comes know what counts 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.199
 ask yourself write the field 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.949
 behind the comma come with me 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.570
 Bacteria gives the important hint 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.370
 very important are the 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.440
 conditions of use of youtube or 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.270
 Thousands strike against it without it 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.070
 know at youtube because no reasonable 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.960
 to make it clear it is a very good one 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.940
 I can not comment on that too much 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.180
 because I say the user condition 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.800
 the Chinese have been there you should 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.080
 maybe you'll just open it up 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.039
 youtube are traveling 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.050
 maybe find in english and take 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.699
 a google translator or something but me 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.259
 personally, but can not say anything 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.009
 you should take a falling nevertheless times 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.289
 read through 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.150
 lukas book is interested in how it looks 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.009
 actually with tags off which day 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.020
 one should use that is a very 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.430
 good question I have myself earlier too 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.990
 always asked what text you got him 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.630
 to use is actually relative 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.820
 just some simple ones you always take 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.460
 what the video contains so if 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.740
 for example, the last us and that 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.110
 minecraft let's play or somehow 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.419
 fit comedy video then you do 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.310
 always as a day thing in the video 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.719
 so to speak, if you are now 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.930
 for example , drop a top 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.729
 just write top so no 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.139
 such points as text so pure 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.520
 do you understand everything that the video 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.530
 includes writing as tegra 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.180
 do not try any names from 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.130
 which sizes youtube on the rhine 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.840
 popping except they have something similar 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.280
 video makes 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.590
 since ever make the name with pure 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.389
 or the video itself all this 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.190
 You can find all the title so that in the 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.530
 day into packing or so yes so it 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.199
 I have already done that but 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.910
 only if the video synonymous of course 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.860
 other user has ever done something 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.540
 so that should always include what is in the 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.040
 video ago came because he is the 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.780
 Long inquires and asks which one 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.830
 Cutting programs can be good for the 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.919
 use the beginning 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.540
 I started with camtasia studio 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.530
 so i think i have my first 50 video 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.150
 I'll give you the fast ones 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.699
 yes, my fifth first is likely the 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.410
 act on private ag 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.700
 can 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.350
 but they all have me with them 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.669
 So I 'm up to the ball 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.889
 actually I have with the fire department 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.300
 taser cut without joke you become 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.250
 Do not believe it but it really is 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.570
 i would reckon everything with cortese if 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.979
 you wanted to start on youtube and 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.180
 really professional a little something 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.139
 times the environment so I would recommend you 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.910
 magix or premiere pro cch now gives 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.850
 it is massively on youtube just pure 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.350
 look or ask people themselves the 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.520
 use programs and if you 're there 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.740
 should so I did that now 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.310
 I have to work like this now
