00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the first day of wear but I do find that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.830 
the first day of wear but I do find that
it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.170> far<00:00:31.619> more<00:00:31.980> manageable<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.210> co<00:00:33.540> wash

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it is far more manageable when I co wash

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.530 
it is far more manageable when I co wash
my<00:00:34.320> hair<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.399> been<00:00:35.610> doing<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.030> almost

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
my hair and I've been doing that almost

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
my hair and I've been doing that almost
every<00:00:37.050> day<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> hair<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.489> seems<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
every day and the hair really seems to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.690 
every day and the hair really seems to
revive<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> point<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.980> really<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.489> like

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
revive at that point I really do like

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
revive at that point I really do like
the<00:00:41.969> hair<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:44.100> am<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.460> sure<00:00:44.760> about

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the hair but I really am not sure about

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
the hair but I really am not sure about
the<00:00:45.180> matching<00:00:47.660> as<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.649> hair

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the matching as you can see here my hair

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
the matching as you can see here my hair
is<00:00:50.010> far<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.550> frizz<00:00:50.820> era<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.180> actually

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
is far more frizz era I'm actually

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
is far more frizz era I'm actually
thinking<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.199> adding<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.770> additional

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
thinking about adding some additional

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
thinking about adding some additional
hair<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:54.059> additional<00:00:54.539> track<00:00:54.840> almost<00:00:55.410> making

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
hair some additional track almost making

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.209 
hair some additional track almost making
it<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.250> full<00:00:56.879> sewin<00:00:57.300> leaving<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it a full sewin leaving very little of

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
it a full sewin leaving very little of
the<00:00:59.370> perimeter<00:00:59.699> out<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> really

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the perimeter out I think this is really

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
the perimeter out I think this is really
kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> breaking<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.760> flow<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.329> know

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
kind of breaking my flow if you know
