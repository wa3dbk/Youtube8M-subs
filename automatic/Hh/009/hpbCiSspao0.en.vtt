00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
at what is it the oil is kind of a bit

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.150 
at what is it the oil is kind of a bit
more<00:01:53.149> like<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.020> mayonnaise<00:01:54.320> II<00:01:54.649> kind<00:01:55.100> of

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
more like and mayonnaise II kind of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.710 
more like and mayonnaise II kind of
globular<00:01:55.460> residue<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.240> find<00:01:56.509> some<00:01:56.660> of

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
globular residue and you find some of

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.749 
globular residue and you find some of
that<00:01:56.869> in<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.350> coolant<00:01:57.740> tank<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.100> well<00:01:58.310> it

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
that in the coolant tank as well it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.399 
that in the coolant tank as well it
suggests<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.300> could<00:01:59.390> be<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.510> major<00:01:59.840> problem

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
suggests it could be a major problem

suggests it could be a major problem
with<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.400> engine<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:03.140> car<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:03.500> that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
with the engine so the car like that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.260
