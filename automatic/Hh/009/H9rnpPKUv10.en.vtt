00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
Guys, I'm not happy, I will do a video about stats in UT
and a already did one but

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.600
so many people still complaning... Seriously my videos 
are so useless ?! Now I do it again

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.000
But now, you rather to not ask again about this...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:21.000
OVERCONFIDENT MOMENT

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.100
Hi everybody and Welcome on AcTFactory it's Raeknake 
(or Drogba_13_OM)

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.250
So the main subject of the video is to learn something (or not)
about stats in UT

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.990
It's explain the title of the video : "Now you know"
or in the language of Molière

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.300
"Maintenant vous savez"

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.740
Hohoho, Did you said Molière ?
also know as Jean-Baptiste Poquelin

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.400
author of famous works like :"The Miser", 
"The Doctor in Spite of Himself" or "The Imaginary Invalid"

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
SHUT UP ! SHUT UP ! SHUT UP !
but the list of his works is too long...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Fuck !

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.000
Now you Know that I am 
freaking crazy...

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
Ep01 - Everthing about Stats

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.600
Thanks everyone for the support !

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.820
Well ! get back to the main subject of the video,
as you can see, I'm reseting starting teams

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.630
because I'm going to answer to some questions like :
"does chemistry boost stats in-game?" or

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.170
"does style cards boosts stats in-game?"

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
So, as you can see, I show you some 
stats of few players because

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.490
firstly, you should know that UT Websites 
like Futhead or Futwiz are not

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.100
good UT database for the regular
cards

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.110
yes because these websites take FIFA 14 in-game 
stats and not FUT in-game stats, explication :

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.860
because on UT since a while, and it was the same 
case on UT 11 (my very first UT &lt;3)

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.000
regular cards have biggest in-game stats than
their FIFA 14 version and that could applied

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.990
to all in-game stats of the player (except Sliding Tackle, 
Vision and Positionning but I will explain why later)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.620
or some of them stats and it could be
vary between a little bonus or a big bonus.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.140
Now, I show you El Shaarawy, it's very interesting,
because you should know that EA

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.550
have upgrade him to 4 stars skills, and it's the first
time it happen definitely (in UT)

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:30.090
before in FIFA 12 some Vancouver players have been 
upgrade to 5 stars skills but it was during 4 days

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.570
So I said it was the first time it happen,
but the problem is, now they could do it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.520
we know they could fix all incoherences of the
 game for the profile of players !

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.500
So, get back to stats. 
It will be more relevant to take in-game stats in a FUT game

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.170
because, actually we take same in-game stats 
of FIFA 14 who applies to FIFA 14,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.480
in fact it's a copy of Sofifa.com website which is a 
very good website for FIFA in-game stats (except FUT).

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.900
But I understand them, all of these FUT websites 
have in-game stats before everyone

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.520
It would be very boring to look each player one by one
(thing they do for In-Form or Upgrade players)

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.720
furthermore, generally when they got FUT 
database for in-game stats players,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.540
FIFA 14 wasn't already available, so impossible
to know real in-game FUT stats.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.710
So it was the introduction, now I will ask to :
"does chemistry boosts stats in-game?"

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.590
I will say "NO" and since the begining, I've see 
some guess who says

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.680
"If you don't have a good chemistry, in game
stats will be decreased but if you get 9/10

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.040
you will get a bonus stats." 
Yeah it was a "good guess" because

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.830
when you look at stats in Futhead
these stats a lower than stats in UT

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.820
As you can see, you have seen the in game stats
of Dzyuba with CS Sniper 0 Chemistry

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.260
and an another Dzyuba with CS Hunter
10 chemistry, it was the same in game stats.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.450
And this is logic, imagine a player with 10 on
chemistry who get higher in game stats

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.270
than his IF version with 2 on chemistry.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.160
So you know that chemistry like chemistry styles cards
didn't, don't and won't boost the in game stats.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.720
In fact, and this is my "guess/theory"
I think that chemistry influence on efficiency

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
of the player and not his in game stats.
It's pretty the same thing but if

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.390
you want to play with words, no.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.320
Other thing I want to show you, 
it's how to calculate approximately

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.830
in game stats of a IF, it will be not 
100% accurate, but still similar.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.760
As you can see, I will compare 2 Berezutskiy,
the first one regular and the second IF.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.760
So now I will ask you to focus on 
improvements between the two cards

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.480
The IF has : +1 on PAC, SHO and DRI,
+2 on HEA, +4 on DEF and +7 on PAS

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.310
And now you will see the in game stats of 
the Regular and finally to calculate the IF improvements

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.310
you had just to add the improvement.
Explication : He has +4 on DEF compared

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.890
to the regular, so for the IF, his Marking
or Standing Tackle for example will get a

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.860
+4 Upgrade from the UT 
Regular in game stats.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.660
As you can see with IF Berezutskiy,
it's pretty accurate, but now the question

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.110
would be : What are the stats on the 6 UT main stats ?
You know : PAC, SHO, DRI, HEA, DEF and PAS.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.820
For this I do a little trick, I buy the 7 of 
boosting cards (all different)

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:22.290
You know +5 PAC, +5 SHO etc...
I apply these cards on IF or UP players

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.830
Because it would be easier to notice
which stats would been improved.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.350
Yeah because, as I said, if I put this card 
on a regular card it would be more difficult

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.120
like a said UT websites don't have the 
correct in game stats for regular cards

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.800
Notice that in UT, Stamina is in fact
the level of the fitness of your player.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.170
As you can see for IF Fernandes with a boost in DEF
We notice that these following stats :

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.190
Standing Tackle, Marking, Aggression, Interceptions
and Reactions have been upgraded

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.520
As you can see also, that Sliding tackle haven't been improved, 
but I find strange that reactions is included in DEF

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.850
Because, this stat is very important for all the
players for all the position

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.320
I put links in the description, that could help you :
 for the Meaning of stats,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.800
and an other link who explain which stat
change the overall of a player for all positions

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.100
I also made a video about this, but I'm sorry
but I don't want to add captions on this, the google doc is better.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.420
In my opinion, I think that Sliding tackle
is included in DEF.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.030
Now for IF Nkoulou with a boost in Dribble, 
We notice that the following stats :

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.810
Ball Controll, Dribble, Agility and Balance
have been upgraded.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.890
For IF Bedimo with boost in all stats, 
we notice like I said that all stats have been

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.950
upgraded except for Sliding Tackle,
Positionning and Vision and this doesn't surprise me

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.540
I can't give you the reason of this, but I noticed
that in all the UT, these stats have never been

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.180
upgraded, whatever what happen 
(IF, UP, MOTM, TOTS etc...)

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.000
Notice that these stats are important for all
style of players : for defenders Sliding Tackle

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.950
for forwards the attacking positionning
and for midfilders the Vision.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.620
For UP Melo with a boost in HEA
We notice that the following stats :

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.160
Heading accuracy, Jumping and
Strength (correctly wrote... :)) have been upgraded

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.460
It's surprising because I always think 
that Strength is for DEF.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.100
For SIF Matuidi with a boost in SHO
We notice that the following stats :

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.990
Curve, FK Accuracy, Penalties, Finishing,
Shot Power, Longshot and Volley have been upgraded

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.720
For IF Drogba with a boost in PAC,
We notice that the following stats :

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.430
Acceleration and Sprint Speed have been 
upgraded, and no surprise here

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.550
For SIF Kalou with a boost in PAS
We notice that the following stats :

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.610
Crossing, Long Passing and Short Passing 
have been upgraded, but I think

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.310
that Vision is also included

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.490
So now you know what are the stats
on the 6 main stats on UT

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.450
Even if the overall of a stat doesn't represent the 
number in the card... Still prove the Logic of FIFA

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.850
But the worse I think it's that is doesn't
means he will be good in game !

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.320
We can only see this UT ! You know a crap IF 
or a player with a low overall who destroy everything

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.040
Anyway, It would be better to don't know...
FUCK EA LOGIC

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.280
So it's was Drogba_13_OM for AcTFactory
I hope this will help you

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.240
For the next episode of "Now You Know"
We will see if Chemistry Styles are really usefull

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.900
But about Stats in Fifa :
"Now you Know"
