specifically for people who have trouble

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.000 
specifically for people who have trouble
when<00:00:06.840> they're<00:00:06.990> doing<00:00:07.140> their<00:00:07.320> chest<00:00:07.590> workout

when they're doing their chest workout

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
when they're doing their chest workout
actually<00:00:08.459> filling<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.940> more<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.299> their<00:00:09.419> chest

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
actually filling it more in their chest

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.539 
actually filling it more in their chest
than<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.049> their<00:00:10.200> shoulders<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.769> triceps<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
than in their shoulders and triceps I

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.029 
than in their shoulders and triceps I
for<00:00:12.299> one<00:00:12.419> have<00:00:12.539> always<00:00:12.780> had<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.289> problem<00:00:13.589> and

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
for one have always had that problem and

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.919 
for one have always had that problem and
although<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.669> feel<00:00:14.969> like<00:00:15.119> I've<00:00:15.269> had<00:00:15.450> decent

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
although I feel like I've had decent

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.450 
although I feel like I've had decent
chest<00:00:16.200> growth<00:00:16.440> over<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> years<00:00:17.190> I'm

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
chest growth over the years I'm

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.280 
chest growth over the years I'm
definitely<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.330> breaking<00:00:18.780> down<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.080> muscle

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
definitely not breaking down the muscle

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.290 
definitely not breaking down the muscle
fibers<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.370> could<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.120> that's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
fibers as well as I could be and that's

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.120 
fibers as well as I could be and that's
specifically<00:00:21.870> just<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.740> shoulders

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
specifically just because my shoulders

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
specifically just because my shoulders
over<00:00:23.370> take<00:00:23.700> a<00:00:23.730> lot<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.120> the<00:00:24.210> chest<00:00:24.450> exercises

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
over take a lot of the chest exercises

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.930 
over take a lot of the chest exercises
that<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:26.040> I<00:00:26.100> basically<00:00:26.490> found<00:00:26.700> out

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
that I do but I basically found out

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.840 
that I do but I basically found out
about<00:00:27.240> some<00:00:27.510> variations<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.520> to

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
about some variations that I can do to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.730 
about some variations that I can do to
actually<00:00:30.390> work<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.840> chest<00:00:31.140> more<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.680> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
actually work my chest more and I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.099 
actually work my chest more and I
definitely<00:00:31.800> notice<00:00:32.519> a<00:00:32.640> huge<00:00:32.940> difference<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
definitely notice a huge difference so I

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.110 
definitely notice a huge difference so I
want<00:00:34.379> to<00:00:34.440> share<00:00:34.679> those<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:34.949> you<00:00:35.190> guys<00:00:35.399> so

you right here is the incline smith
machine<00:00:39.870> press<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:41.399> small<00:00:41.699> yet<00:00:41.969> crucial

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
machine press and the small yet crucial

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.209 
machine press and the small yet crucial
changes<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.109> made<00:00:43.469> while<00:00:43.739> doing<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
changes that I made while doing this

exercise<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.909> feel<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.269> more<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.569> my<00:00:45.749> upper

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
exercise to feel it more in my upper

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.799 
exercise to feel it more in my upper
chest<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:47.159> to<00:00:47.339> scoot<00:00:47.699> up<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.569> bar

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
chest was to scoot up and have the bar

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
chest was to scoot up and have the bar
when<00:00:49.109> it<00:00:49.199> comes<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:49.679> just<00:00:49.710> lightly<00:00:50.640> like

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
when it comes down just lightly like

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360 
when it comes down just lightly like
almost<00:00:51.239> graze<00:00:51.629> my<00:00:51.899> chin<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.249> way

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
almost graze my chin and then on the way

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189 
almost graze my chin and then on the way
up<00:00:53.609> I'm<00:00:53.819> actually<00:00:53.999> pushing<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.719> elbows

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
up I'm actually pushing my elbows

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.739 
up I'm actually pushing my elbows
outward<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.979> away<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.339> me<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.539> an

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
outward and away from me it's not an

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.840 
outward and away from me it's not an
overly<00:00:58.079> noticeable<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> can

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
overly noticeable thing that you can

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.090 
overly noticeable thing that you can
really<00:00:59.879> even<00:01:00.329> tell<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> camera<00:01:00.929> but<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> makes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
really even tell on camera but it makes

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
really even tell on camera but it makes
the<00:01:02.249> world<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.909> difference<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.600> either

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the world of a difference of either

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
the world of a difference of either
feeling<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:04.979> upper<00:01:05.309> chest<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:06.090> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
feeling it in your upper chest or just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
feeling it in your upper chest or just
having<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.780> front<00:01:07.049> delts<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.649> most<00:01:07.829> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
having your front delts doing most of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
having your front delts doing most of
the<00:01:08.009> work<00:01:08.280> another<00:01:09.180> small<00:01:09.600> yet<00:01:09.899> crucial

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the work another small yet crucial

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
the work another small yet crucial
change<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:10.890> made<00:01:11.070> while<00:01:11.280> doing<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
change that I've made while doing this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
change that I've made while doing this
is<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.509> pressing<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.140> lower<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.619> into

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
is actually pressing my lower back into

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
is actually pressing my lower back into
the<00:01:14.159> bench<00:01:14.490> instead<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.390> arcing<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the bench instead of actually arcing it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.779 
the bench instead of actually arcing it
while<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> same<00:01:16.680> time<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.189> sticking<00:01:17.759> my

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
while at the same time I'm sticking my

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.209 
while at the same time I'm sticking my
chest<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.630> far<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.899> possible<00:01:19.079> and<00:01:19.799> I'm

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
chest out as far as possible and I'm

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:21.560 
chest out as far as possible and I'm
keeping<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.700> tight<00:01:20.909> throughout<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> whole

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
keeping it tight throughout the whole

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
keeping it tight throughout the whole
motion<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.500> focusing<00:01:23.009> hard<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.399> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
motion and really focusing hard on that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
motion and really focusing hard on that
which<00:01:23.789> is<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.570> harder<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
which is actually a lot harder than it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
which is actually a lot harder than it
looks<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:26.159> pretty<00:01:26.399> much<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.759> cherry<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.149> top

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
looks then pretty much the cherry on top

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
looks then pretty much the cherry on top
of<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.719> exercise<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.469> end<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.859> really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of this exercise at the end to really

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.310 
of this exercise at the end to really
get<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.460> pump<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.969> chest<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
get that pump in the chest going is to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
get that pump in the chest going is to
drop<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> weight<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.490> some

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
drop some of the weight and do some

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
drop some of the weight and do some
partial<00:01:33.119> reps<00:01:33.359> these<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:33.869> noticed<00:01:34.170> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
partial reps these I've noticed just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
partial reps these I've noticed just
absolutely<00:01:34.799> destroy<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.609> upper<00:01:35.850> chest

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
after going to failure on a regular set

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.310 
after going to failure on a regular set
and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> highly<00:01:38.340> recommend<00:01:38.490> doing<00:01:39.149> them

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and I highly recommend doing them

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.599 
and I highly recommend doing them

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
puffing your chest out it's amazing how

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
puffing your chest out it's amazing how
much<00:02:01.140> different<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> movement<00:02:02.159> feels<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
much different the movement feels and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
much different the movement feels and
how<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.869> chest<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> involved

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890

replace your typical barbell press or
your<00:02:11.129> dumbbell<00:02:11.519> presses<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.090> still<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.659> a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
your dumbbell presses I still as a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.670 
your dumbbell presses I still as a
matter<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.019> fact<00:02:13.230> did<00:02:13.409> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
matter of fact did the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.110 
matter of fact did the
but<00:02:13.829> you<00:02:13.920> guys<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.250> seen<00:02:14.430> plenty<00:02:14.609> of<00:02:14.760> videos

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
but you guys have seen plenty of videos

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.630 
but you guys have seen plenty of videos
of<00:02:15.299> me<00:02:15.450> doing<00:02:15.480> those<00:02:16.409> exercises<00:02:16.439> but<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of me doing those exercises but the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.330 
of me doing those exercises but the
problem<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.359> that<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:19.319> shoulders<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:20.069> so

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
problem is is that my shoulders are so

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.699 
problem is is that my shoulders are so
trained<00:02:20.969> to<00:02:21.209> do<00:02:21.359> most<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.049> work<00:02:22.079> mostly

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
trained to do most of the work mostly

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.979 
trained to do most of the work mostly
due<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:22.980> myself<00:02:23.549> overtraining<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:24.599> shoulders

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
due to myself overtraining my shoulders

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.619 
due to myself overtraining my shoulders
and<00:02:25.170> under<00:02:25.439> training<00:02:25.769> my<00:02:25.920> chest<00:02:26.219> early<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.790> but

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
and under training my chest early on but

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.539 
and under training my chest early on but
I'm<00:02:27.780> basically<00:02:28.079> using<00:02:28.290> these<00:02:28.650> exercises<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
I'm basically using these exercises as a

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.270 
I'm basically using these exercises as a
tool<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.689> my<00:02:30.840> chest<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.469> get<00:02:31.859> used<00:02:32.129> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
tool to get my chest to get used to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.979 
tool to get my chest to get used to
doing<00:02:32.459> most<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:32.969> the<00:02:33.030> work<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.719> a<00:02:33.750> lot

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
doing most of the work which is a lot

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.170 
doing most of the work which is a lot
easier<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:34.950> type<00:02:35.189> of<00:02:35.219> machines<00:02:35.549> than<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
easier on these type of machines than it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
easier on these type of machines than it
is<00:02:36.329> with<00:02:36.540> free<00:02:36.719> weights<00:02:36.989> I'm<00:02:37.500> basically<00:02:37.889> just

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
is with free weights I'm basically just

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.099 
is with free weights I'm basically just
having<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.549> retrain<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.299> chest<00:02:39.599> how<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> work

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
having to retrain my chest how to work

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.050 
having to retrain my chest how to work
in<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.409> way<00:02:40.560> another<00:02:41.010> thing<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.400> I'm<00:02:41.489> doing<00:02:41.519> is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
in a way another thing that I'm doing is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.619 
in a way another thing that I'm doing is
chest<00:02:42.659> flies<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.469> cables<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.400> I've<00:02:45.030> mostly

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
chest flies with cables and I've mostly

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.210 
chest flies with cables and I've mostly
done<00:02:45.810> these<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.139> like<00:02:46.319> machines<00:02:46.709> before<00:02:47.069> like

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
done these on like machines before like

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.830 
done these on like machines before like
the<00:02:47.340> PEC<00:02:47.549> deck<00:02:47.579> which<00:02:48.000> those<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.419> great<00:02:48.599> too

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the PEC deck which those are great too

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.699 
the PEC deck which those are great too
but<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.980> honestly<00:02:50.669> feel<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.230> tension<00:02:52.590> has

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
but I honestly feel that the tension has

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.220 
but I honestly feel that the tension has
kept<00:02:52.950> more<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.430> my<00:02:53.579> chest<00:02:53.909> with<00:02:54.569> these<00:02:54.810> cable

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
kept more on my chest with these cable

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.110 
kept more on my chest with these cable
exercises<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:55.980> I'll<00:02:56.099> usually<00:02:56.489> opt<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:57.000> these

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
exercises so I'll usually opt for these

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.720 
exercises so I'll usually opt for these
over<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.780> PEC<00:02:57.959> deck<00:02:57.989> but<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:58.889> I<00:02:59.010> said<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.219> also

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
over the PEC deck but like I said I also

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.640 
over the PEC deck but like I said I also
do<00:03:00.060> those<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.569> you've<00:03:00.780> seen<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.169> also<00:03:01.409> do

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
do those and as you've seen I also do

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.319 
do those and as you've seen I also do
them<00:03:01.769> with<00:03:01.889> dumbbells<00:03:02.280> too<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.819> got<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> say

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
them with dumbbells too but I got a say

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.300 
them with dumbbells too but I got a say
with<00:03:03.540> these<00:03:03.659> cable<00:03:04.109> exercises<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.889> definitely

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
with these cable exercises I definitely

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.940 
with these cable exercises I definitely
feel<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.669> tension<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.269> my<00:03:06.510> chest<00:03:06.950> constantly

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
feel the tension on my chest constantly

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.520 
feel the tension on my chest constantly
compared<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.669> other<00:03:08.849> ones<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.930> usually

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
compared to the other ones so I usually

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.559 
compared to the other ones so I usually
offer<00:03:10.739> these<00:03:11.099> especially<00:03:11.579> as<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:12.030> late<00:03:12.269> and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's the same concept like I'm always

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.699 
it's the same concept like I'm always
squeezing<00:03:15.510> my<00:03:15.780> chest<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.379> something

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
squeezing my chest and that's something

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.619 
squeezing my chest and that's something
I'm<00:03:16.799> really<00:03:16.829> really<00:03:17.519> working<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.299> I'm<00:03:18.389> not

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
I'm really really working on and I'm not

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.240 
I'm really really working on and I'm not
concerned<00:03:19.079> with<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.349> weight<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.799> much<00:03:20.040> on

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
concerned with the weight so much on

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.770 
concerned with the weight so much on
this<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:21.090> I'm<00:03:21.209> not<00:03:21.359> doing<00:03:21.419> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
this as you can see I'm not doing a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.199 
this as you can see I'm not doing a
whole<00:03:21.959> lot<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.560> little<00:03:23.370> tip<00:03:23.579> when<00:03:23.729> doing<00:03:24.090> these

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
whole lot a little tip when doing these

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.430 
whole lot a little tip when doing these
that<00:03:24.449> actually<00:03:24.569> makes<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.019> world<00:03:25.199> of

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that actually makes a world of

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.710 
that actually makes a world of
difference<00:03:25.859> is<00:03:26.069> slightly<00:03:27.000> turning<00:03:27.479> your

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
difference is slightly turning your

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.390 
difference is slightly turning your
wrists<00:03:28.049> up<00:03:28.260> when<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.799> doing<00:03:29.099> them<00:03:29.189> and

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
wrists up when you're doing them and

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.800 
wrists up when you're doing them and
it's<00:03:29.579> almost<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> can't<00:03:30.449> even<00:03:30.510> tell

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it's almost like you can't even tell

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.449 
it's almost like you can't even tell
that<00:03:30.989> I'm<00:03:31.109> doing<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.739> really<00:03:32.099> feel<00:03:32.430> like

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
that I'm doing it but I really feel like

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.339 
that I'm doing it but I really feel like
I'm<00:03:32.970> actually<00:03:33.120> leading<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.019> bottom

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.990 
I'm actually leading with the bottom
part<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.650> my<00:03:34.709> hand<00:03:35.010> compared<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.579> just<00:03:35.760> going

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
part of my hand compared to just going

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.909 
part of my hand compared to just going
straight<00:03:36.090> across<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.379> actually<00:03:37.530> makes<00:03:37.829> a

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
straight across and it actually makes a

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.929 
straight across and it actually makes a
world<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.220> difference<00:03:38.280> when<00:03:38.699> you're<00:03:38.790> trying
