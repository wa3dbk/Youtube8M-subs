 here to hunt until we open the 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.270
 door that this reminds me already to a map 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.770
 that I do not remember if sleeping is what 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.590
 first we did a little bit 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.239
 everything as we are in challenge number 7 and 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.010
 I took that out , I only have two parts left 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.780
 is that so this child is very very 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.330
 I cut bones but it's not going to be that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.460
 I hit 400 hosts here and good 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.930
 we made a challenge is quite tricky 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.290
 we are opening the doors 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 pain 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.750
 I hated these serious ones I say 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.630
 I hope as they will know how to behave right now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.460
 called the plot 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.090
 we are opening 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090
 God 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 I remember that they put me 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300
 horrible 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.610
 see you we're here pretty arrows 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.920
 to the block good boy the truth is that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.509
 I do not know if you have me because I have already done 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.590
 two videos and this is the third one that I do 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.500
 and I forgot to comment that I'm there 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.119
 we see that I'm seeing to see 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.860
 which, as we have already finished, shows 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.070
 take the other the resident evil series 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.980

 what a fast fasting to pass 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.570
 it is possible 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.039
 the shit perez charm because this is 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.670
 impossible 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.890
 often can not put 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.390
 fuck let's do one thing is not something 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.820
 because I pulled back against 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.070
 the TNT and I'm going to do let's put here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.110
 a plate 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.299
 a wooden board for example and so 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.829
 be able to like that so I'll be able to run 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.210
 quietly and these guys I'm 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.179
 waiting while we are going to do here a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.130
 this to see that how many mods below in 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.739
 The more I say the better but good 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.819
 his would not be either the excessive 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.840
 because through the ring that I'm 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.030
 doing but there are some who are going to call 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.739
 even attention that was like weapons 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.030
 machine guns stuff like that is the one that most 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.920
 run run run run run 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.920
 run runs used run 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.409
 the last plate he touches or should open 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.049
 the door the palette that a plant is 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.939
 the case yesterday 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.950
 this is the last one is the last one the last 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.079
 challenge I am already inside finds me the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.139
 right way find carrots 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.670
 find carrots look I do not know that in 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.250
 these are worth to activate this 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.200
 Sleeping rector number 9 we have others 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.389
 two challenges I'm going to throw for the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.400
 way above the king mini mouse not 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.719
 mark nothing we are going to paste a sobada not 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.409
 I know not how many fast ones he got on top 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.659
 since 40 carrots 45 carrots for 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.659
 all that I lost that I remember that 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.549
 at the beginning of the jump he lost like 20 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.620
 carrots then salt I got save 3 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.480
 in short many many guides I'm going to throw myself 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.919
 on the right path because I'm shot 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.109
 the left and it ended badly so we're going to 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.989
 pull right to see where we end up 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:16.959
 football 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.100
 do not look for not read nothing was here now 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.660
 from here 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.750
 I would like this from what you are looking for I do not know 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.210
 what 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.210
 do not look where there is no lava street 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.560
 the last boat another 55 carrots east 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.020
 it would be challenge number 10 and the final 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.080
 the one that will finish us now 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.160
 with which pussy 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 I would say it's around here it's easy this 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.050
 this little parkour another moneta and we 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.980
 we are not going up or that here you have to 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.310
 be for the monkeys that pussy seeming 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.310
 the ticket 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.819
 now let's put it more or less here 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.420
 in front of 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.420
 we go 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.220
 I wish the lever looks lets the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.690
 tempt Oriana then got 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.640
 55 the good half is wrong if you 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.750

 payment I hope you have fun 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.510
 acmein youtube creation the most 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.340
 important is that the facts unworthy of 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.540
 good use a small ki-moon 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.250
 prince for because it was impossible to me 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.840
 I think that jump there is no human form 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.830
 of jumping so I had to have a 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.170
 little of my more suddenly the more 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.690
 high has been perfectly done and 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.100
 we are well executed so we are going to 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.390
 pull the lever and let's see how 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.590
 You see my minecraft is safe 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.280
 that there is what interest there is something that 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.280
 prepare if you want to play 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.560
 to play 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.560
 you do not learn 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.940
 the failed east water of the rest 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.300
 it will be running, it does not arrive, it does not arrive 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.300
 the current 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.419
 carries 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 2. 3 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.320
 in six months terminal I have done it 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.760
 against so that I go there and what 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 discover that way so it's been 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.050
 bad good guys but they liked it 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.400
 This second part of this map of 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.900
 park had land behind I'm going to 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.850
 leave the description if I do not forget 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.620

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.790
 and that some visits is that you are you 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.200
 a bastard because you tell me you're going to 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.240
 put the map and as you do not put it back 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.440
 home with the link of the mod and you put it and 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.480

 parkour that good the truth is that I 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.440
 I'm happy with myself inside 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.970
 minecraft because I know that the bank at 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.470
 beginning it was horrible you end maps of 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.120
 parkour we want to catch and there would be a 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.380
