00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.350
 January, but first of all I want to give you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.150
 thanks for the response you have 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.620
 had the previous video very many 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 thanks for the comments that I 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.789
 you have left it turns out that you liked it and I 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.810
 as the person who entertains more than 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.609
 so good he has done a lot of illusion 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.560
 so thank you very much for all the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.899
 comments if you have not seen it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 I'll leave here on the link here 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.309
 down in the box information and nothing I'm going 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.589
 to start with the favorites the first 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.420
 I want to teach you and well I think 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.219
 I already commented on some video I'm in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
 twitter about everything is getting the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.179
 skin badly enough or here I'm going 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 makeup then something is disguised 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.960
 but it does not bother me to hide it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.230
 a lot here I'm having an outbreak 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.390
 a little ugly around here so I'm not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.850
 having the skin very well and I went to the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 my lifelong village pharmacy 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.930
 about a week ago a month and so and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.010
 the dermatologist 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.080
 specialist dermatologist girl 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.080
 dermatology or whatever but good to me 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.740
 recommended the range was a bioderma 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.780
 I recommended the cleansing gel a cream 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.640
 moisturizer that is also treatment and 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.830
 what I'm most noticing that is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.020
 doing enough effects today you see a 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.640
 serum and that I had seen mention to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.590
 someone to elena I think and I think he said 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.510
 I was going well on me the truth 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.830
 I 'm really liking it, I'm 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.409
 using one night and another not because 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.200
 it's quite so I notice quite 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.780
 Aggressive is a chemical exfoliant that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 when I 'm not sure what 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.299
 ingredients has nothing but good 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.729
 so I'm noticing that I'm 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.929
 doing quite an effect and it is not enough 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.459
 to little also removing a little 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.880
 scars that are staying because 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.920
 I have no grains but many ugly 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.479
 scars so good is going to me 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 pretty well the truth is lasting me 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.429
 a lot and I will tell you later 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 also when it does not finish to see if it deserves 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.030
 it is , and told me to use 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.109
 for a month just really but what 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.610
 I've been using a little bit more because 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.190
 still it has not happened to me at all 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.259
 and I have thrown it but well yes that 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.970
 I really like a combination that was 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 using a lot in the month of January has 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.130
 been this first prime time to watch 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.430
 minerals that I bought do not follow 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.610
 instagram created a kit to see minerals 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.750
 with two mineral bases the weill I do not know 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.580
 that I have not tried it yet 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 enough to have an opinion 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.840
 but I'm liking it a lot and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.250
 I'm using the tassel a lot 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.709
 and what comes is how it has a feeling 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.140
 very as if it had silicones but not 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.180
 has to let me know and leave a very finished 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 very smooth the skin the base goes super well 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.580
 above and then he's also using 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.670
 very good the big bird and be big 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.110
 easy cause of benefit victim who already 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.650
 I had tried it on its day it gave me some 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.270
 samples but so she alone does not 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.459
 it marked the pebbles a bit and everything 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.590
 I have quite mixed skin but with 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.960
 this test fits me fantastic 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.810
 it is a bit clear but 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
 the truth is that it is rusting with the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.970
 time a little bit so I have the most tone 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 clear the 010 and I'm doing well and I like it 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.940
 a lot because there are also times that neither 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.130
 he even used powder because it's 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
 quite matte but without being without acartone 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.550
 so I do not like them very much 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.070
 they are of the pile it lasts quite a lot also 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.270
 to make a life and climate so and already 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.400
 finally this video is going to be very 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.170
 quickie I have two mac radials that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.110
 I'm using the first one a lot 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.450
 I put today is the zew that is pretty 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.190
 seemed the full plan that if not what 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.140
 You know I've lost it and it gives me so much 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.430
 rage because they use it a lot and you 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.990
 I assure that if I buy it I will 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.240
 I meet then I said look so very 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.160
 purchases and although it is quite similar and 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.290
 it's a luster finish it 's pretty 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.480
 bright as you can see is not very 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 pigmented and it's quite moisturizing the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.450
 duration is not fantastic but it's that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.820
 It was green the tone I love is with a 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.580
 sun full plan but a little bit colder be 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.130
 A pink ciro was a tad cold to me 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.520
 I like them very much I love me 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.130
 like 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.310
 I like it a lot for everyday 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 It's great and when I've wanted something 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.100
 a little more 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.230
 Boom as you could see in Instagram 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.780
 It gives cyber quite a bit this month 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.360
 which is the case as you see it inserted 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.980
 here the photo that would have been instagram 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.540
 good to upload them but one that 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.030
 he especially had a lot of success to me 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.890
 I love that photo and the truth is that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.410
 I like them very much as I have left 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.020
 he also showed off with a smoked 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.540
 brown pretty dark and I do not know how I like 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.810
 as to give contrast I do not know or is the 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.720
 contrast of the eyes and lips very loaded 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.240
 to me with these colors I like a 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.550
 heap and also now in winter 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.350
 like it hits very well so it's a 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.660
 that the only bad thing that I see is how 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.070
 to all the satin is that he stayed in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.240
 the spfw and it said is a lot so either 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.370
 make you have your lips 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.520
 perfectly hydrated and everything better 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.320
 it happens why why not but good to me 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.050
 I think a color 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.540
 is that it is a pass is a pass and 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.890
 then I want to show you a product that 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.650
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.970
 little disappointment you do not know how a 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.580
 featured product of the month because what 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.870
 they use a lot but a little disappointment 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.570
 and it is now explained is man 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.500
 man black star the battery in the tone 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.850
 with perfection 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.850
 it's this lathe here 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:27.200
 is one that has enough flashes as 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.930
 golden and like that and to see is a tone 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.970
 precious and what happens that I do not know 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.430
 transmits very well I do not know if it is that I do not 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.950
 it worked very well or so but like that 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.720
 it stays a brown like very me when you 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.760
 you put it in your eyes other than one thing 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.280
 that has disappointed me a lot is the 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.260
 duration if it lasts me hard 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.610
 a lot that is now valued 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.560
 because I just put it on but if I 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.630
 let it rest or it stays like tim 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.120
 taylor and it costs a lot to remove them 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.320
 in the store, flipping carrots, we went to 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.480
 the store bought us both the same 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.780
 first we go with the adoration once 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.060
 settle you do not work stays there still 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.470
 in the hand in the eyes to me with the 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.169
 tests to nars that to me the shadows 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.760
 in powder they last me what you want and marsé 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.470
 ring I tell you that some I said that 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.360
 is where will you get to work and the 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.529
 smoked has been perfect at the end 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.389
 from that one pass 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.919
 this does not last me things I do not want 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.659
 imagine without proving what the fuck is they are 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.849
 now he told me in fact that there is a 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:22.669
 dialogue always based and it disappeared 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.849
 does like folds besides no no 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.339
 is disappearing well because it is 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.809
 using as much because it is very comfortable 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:32.239
 that number 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.409
 to a smoked one color with this 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:35.479
 I also put it on the entire eyelid 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.879
 mobile and then I'm blurring it how 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.399
 the bottom part in the water nine and 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.959
 it is very good that yes if you are going to be 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.359
 long time make-up forget it because 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:46.030
 it is also going away it is going going fatal 

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:48.010
 it is very ugly 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.390
 that's why I also pay 30 euros which is 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.070
 more expensive than normal but good I would 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.570
 I bought in physical store you can take 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.320
 and everything and I do not know a bit a little disappointment 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.300
 yes there 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.479
 what are we going to do wise for those who 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.490
 you are hungry for this product 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:07.069
 I think that for example kiko's stick does not 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.779
 I know very well who shades they have but 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:12.659
 sure they hold more or the same and 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:13.800
 will be worth half or less of the price as well 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.839
 that nothing is all I hope that I have 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.449
 liked the video I recorded the 

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:20.069
 makeup that I wear now that is not 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.990
 nothing special to see if I get it 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.159
 edit because many times I said in 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.919
 the game this makeup that we're going to 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:27.419
 remain so I do not expect anything to be able to edit 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:29.129
 which you do soon in the nails 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.080
 before you ask me I'm after
