00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
interesting card from this pack I think

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.520 
interesting card from this pack I think
it's<00:00:12.179> by<00:00:12.300> far<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.630> most<00:00:12.719> interesting<00:00:12.900> card

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
it's by far the most interesting card

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's by far the most interesting card
out<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.799> them<00:00:14.040> yes<00:00:14.790> light<00:00:15.000> pulse<00:00:15.210> our<00:00:15.389> dragon

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
out of them yes light pulse our dragon

dark flare dragon and eclipse dragon are
very<00:00:18.930> good<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:20.100> none<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> them<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.520> quite<00:00:20.640> as

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
very good but none of them are quite as

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.189 
very good but none of them are quite as
interesting<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> one

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
interesting is this one because this one

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.580 
interesting is this one because this one
really<00:00:22.500> ties<00:00:22.890> together<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.699> chaos<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
really ties together the chaos kind of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.240 
really ties together the chaos kind of
card<00:00:26.070> type<00:00:26.340> into<00:00:27.269> an<00:00:27.750> engine<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
card type into an engine because the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.380 
card type into an engine because the
rest<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.119> chaos

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
rest of them is just kind of a chaos

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.720 
rest of them is just kind of a chaos
card<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:30.900> chaos<00:00:31.320> car<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.219> they're

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
card here chaos car there and they're

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
card here chaos car there and they're
all<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> things<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
all just kind of things they can kind of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.319 
all just kind of things they can kind of
splash<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.380> there<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.550> unifies<00:00:36.120> them

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
splash in there this really unifies them

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
splash in there this really unifies them
as<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.750> engine<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.350> makes<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.040> viable

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
as an engine and makes it a viable

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.389 
as an engine and makes it a viable
strategy<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:39.120> itself<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> fact<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> can

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
strategy in itself the fact that you can

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.959 
strategy in itself the fact that you can
just<00:00:41.719> keep<00:00:43.040> netting<00:00:44.040> advantage<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
just keep netting advantage off of this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.130 
just keep netting advantage off of this
just<00:00:45.300> by<00:00:45.390> doing<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.050> been

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just by doing what you would have been

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
just by doing what you would have been
doing<00:00:46.260> anyways<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:47.399> playing<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> chaos<00:00:48.000> cards

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
mystical Space typhoon next turn you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
mystical Space typhoon next turn you can
at<00:01:18.060> least<00:01:18.090> search<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.780> an<00:01:18.930> effective<00:01:19.439> aylar

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
at least search out an effective aylar

or something low like that so you're not

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.810 
or something low like that so you're not
really<00:01:22.530> losing<00:01:23.040> anything<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.670> kind

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really losing anything you're just kind

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
really losing anything you're just kind
of<00:01:23.850> swapping<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:26.100> really

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
of swapping what you have and it really

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.010 
of swapping what you have and it really
puts<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.299> pressure<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.810> them

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
puts a kind of a pressure on them

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
puts a kind of a pressure on them
because<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> makes<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.009> makes<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> very

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because it makes them it makes it very

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.660 
because it makes them it makes it very
hard<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> net<00:01:30.360> advantage<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
hard for them to net advantage on you

hype<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> deck<00:02:28.349> up<00:02:28.560> when<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.280> came<00:02:29.519> out<00:02:29.549> but<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
hype that deck up when it came out but I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.030 
hype that deck up when it came out but I
I<00:02:30.720> knew<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> wasn't<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:31.739> too<00:02:31.890> well

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
I knew it wasn't going to do too well

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
I knew it wasn't going to do too well
because<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.430> its<00:02:32.940> lack<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.329> consistency<00:02:33.840> lot

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
utilize chaos zone would be the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.920 
utilize chaos zone would be the
macrocosmos<00:02:53.250> decks<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.329> just<00:02:54.569> based<00:02:54.750> around

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
macrocosmos decks that just based around

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.160 
macrocosmos decks that just based around
moving<00:02:55.769> everything<00:02:56.220> from<00:02:56.609> play<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.510> basically

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
moving everything from play so basically

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
moving everything from play so basically
a<00:02:58.200> hole<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.829> then<00:02:58.920> what's<00:02:59.220> nice<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.459> cal<00:02:59.819> stone

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
a hole and then what's nice is cal stone

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240 
a hole and then what's nice is cal stone
doesn't<00:03:00.209> specify<00:03:00.450> your<00:03:01.230> monster<00:03:01.890> has<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.159> be

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
doesn't specify your monster has to be

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.319 
doesn't specify your monster has to be
banished<00:03:02.579> just<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.680> monster<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.829> monsters<00:03:05.519> so

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
banished just a monster or monsters so

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.259 
banished just a monster or monsters so
it<00:03:06.810> counts<00:03:06.989> your<00:03:07.230> opponents<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.739> well<00:03:08.269> which

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
it counts your opponents as well which

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.339 
it counts your opponents as well which
is<00:03:09.299> interesting<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.049> then

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
is interesting because you can then

check it against payoffs decks which is
food<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.109> thought<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.310> macro

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579
