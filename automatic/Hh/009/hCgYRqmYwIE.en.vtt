00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.750
 Y 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.880
 and now today we're going to talk about hot 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.500
 line miami 2 which is the sequel to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.140
 successful independent game released 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.400
 in 2012 which is ultra violent and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.110
 in fact the sequel has become in the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.180
 game in which more times he died in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.710
 all my life so here I explain to you 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.510
 what should you try 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.460
 this time the story of nine is told 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.750
 protagonists each chapter shows a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.239
 brief introduction that places you in 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.860
 different places and times the detail 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.870
 is that with so many characters and jumps in 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.610
 time is very easy to get lost and the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.010
 story ends up being even more confusing 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.510
 and ambiguous that the first delivery the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.280
 goal of each mission is to eliminate 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.659
 all the enemies of a building but 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.730
 this time you have a lot more variety of 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.440
 situations there are some missions where 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.510
 you can choose your mask and use two 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 machine guns another where you're a veteran 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.110
 of war that can only be used by a 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 weapon for the entire mission and others where 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 you control a policeman who by rule does not 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.899
 can session anyone the fight is so 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.060
 fast and frantic that is impossible not 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.140
 feel the adrenaline a single bullet or 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.030
 west means that you will have to 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.280
 restart the level again and again until 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 that you make it perfect this forces you to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.399
 use different strategies that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.259
 they vary between shooting everyone 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.990
 the author and montana telling himself in the car 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.920
 miley see friends or be like solid snake 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.170
 and knock down your enemies 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.399
 silently one by one 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.259
 happily design and levels you 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.270
 allows you to improvise and find multiple 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.219
 solutions to the same situation 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.840
 the game is based a lot on trial and error 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.399
 then normally it reaches the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.439
 building where you have to visit everything 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.240
 the world and you can be your mask 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 love alexis because one has a 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 chainsaw and another one gun you control 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.729
 both characters at the same time and going to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.890
 center see what we are going to deliver to the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.950
 nightclub to greet people we go to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.990
 have only one bullet in the head 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 memory of one then I already learned that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.469
 although I already learned that that guy has a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 gun then do not return it leaving 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.149
 around here and a chainsaw and do it 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.979
 having then I already know that one has a 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.349
 boy another has a gun 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.329
 again and again in this game and dies 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.280
 gun dies a boy and I learned that in 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:20.110
 that room and these two guys I closed 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.470
 here are two more types as he plays 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.909
 and it seems that I am bad but you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.120
 they will also die a lot of times 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.950
 but that's what fun is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.599
 graphic style and retro details 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.220
 they allow to create a surreal atmosphere 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.129
 where you're never sure if you're in a 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.599
 illustration or in a dream see her massage 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.519
 after each level they are disturbing or 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.989
 reflections your actions the music 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.640
 electronics is equal to or better than 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.049
 first delivery and puts you in a trance 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.970
 where you always want to do things 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.650
 faster and the menus are controlled as 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.750
 a vhs tape that at the end of the day 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.459
 reinforces the narrative structure all 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.870
 this creates a memorable experience that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.280
 It absorbs you for hours and where your 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.590
 reflexes are the best weapon for 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.180
 survive a topic to keep in mind is 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.129
 that after so much action one ends 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.629
 exhausted after a few hours so 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.819
 I suggest you measure and play the 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.010
 campaign in controlled doses plus the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.299
 levels to be much larger make 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 make it more likely that you will die 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.989
 long distance shooting happily he 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.220
 add an option to target 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.500
 to do things a little more 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.150
 simple, just prepare to feel 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.590
 the wrath of when the last enemy of a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.879
 level of surprise attack and you to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.760
 restart the session that you have tried 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.290
 go through more than half an hour it will take them 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 about 9 or 10 hours ends the campaign 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.709
 but then unlock a mode where 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.170
 things get even more difficult 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.700
 besides final score of each level you 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.130
 invite you to play them again for 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.960
 get a better rating on it 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.550
 has added 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.080
 level editor that continues in version 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.270
 beta but it could be interesting to 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.950
 create things in the future so why 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.720
 only 15 dollars I think when the Miami 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.440
 2 is a cute sequel that offers more 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440
 how much 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.800
 so my first suggestion is that 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.570
 can in the previous game which I think 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.340
 that has a better focus and was 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.290
 better price but if you like that action 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.270
 super fast of that surreal world 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.220
 I think in the end with the Miami where it's going 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.840
 to use a lot is basically the same 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.800
 that the first but the content what 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.800
 multiplied by three
