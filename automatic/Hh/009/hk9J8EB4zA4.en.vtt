00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
 I do not know how to use the conditioner some 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.040
 we will not use it 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.260
 that year is not getting going anymore 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 that the compañeras do not let her see 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.599
 gentlemen tomás very serious and although 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.690
 Thursday but you have to smile a quick and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.690
 funny 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.270
 good looking for the way to condition 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 the hair so that all these things 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.710
 work as they tell us and we do not want 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 see the husband hey no because the hair 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.610
 it's more sensual then come sir 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610
 you have to take care of that hair 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.719
 the truth that we are going very rich 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.460
 It is very fun and at home we are going to 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.010
 take care of the hair really something very 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.079
 nice we can give now so 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.510
 that perfect touch to not throw it away 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.399
 mess up what not at the time of washing it but 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.079
 we usually use it badly and the one that 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.309
 you undoubtedly end up on the floor 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.110
 it's true even more if what happens is 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.240
 that not all hair should 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.250
 use the conditioner very 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.909
 important there are women with scarce 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.220
 hair and also thin ok I suggest 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.610
 in those cases use only your 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.700
 shampoo and today and only at the tips 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.619
 use the conditioner now there 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.810
 conditioners of different types 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 different brands and good what is it 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.770
 they give us to provide good hairstyle 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.539
 obviously a much more 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.950
 fast unravel without breaking the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.350
 true tip 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.030
 the most important thing is that you worry 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.799
 inside the shower to be able 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 untangle your hair if your hair is 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.009
 long and very curly imagine the size 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.219
 of hair of sonja sohn with your curl 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.429
 I used to have maximum activity and there 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.069
 we need conditioner very well from 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.200
 means to tips nothing more means to ends 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.090
 we're not going to use it at root because in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 root we weaken it and then it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.229
 begins to fall a lot more hair well 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.939
 because because it contains the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.369
 condition what for what he felt 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.500
 softens so much that what it does is that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
 lose a little bit and then if you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.049
 you use in the root totally is what's 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.599
 to release now I suggest in most 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.360
 of the cases that look for conditioner 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.769
 neutral will not find it like in the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.380
 self-service stores because I was going to 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.130
 say for curly hair and dyed not 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.720
 for long curly hair if you go to 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.549
 a store where they sell all these 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 beauty things you'll find even by 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.030
 gallon 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 the neutral conditioner suit this 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.950
 precisely to create the consistency 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.600
 what's in it because there are conditioners 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.430
 too creamy look even this 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 it has a little bit of transparency 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.860
 It seems a bit like I do not know clarita 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.930
 of egg like a little more of this 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.270
 dark is not the consistency that 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.460
 you must search so that you do not 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.850
 mistreat your hair so much I explain 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.230
 the more you are not going to help him more 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.660
 because you are not applying it so much 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
 chemical to your hair remember that no 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.220
 it's just the conditioner is the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.390
 conditioner is the shampoo is the dye 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.310
 the waxes the dryer that is then 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.070
 let's go calmly a person with 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.440
 curly hair all uses well a 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.260
 conditioner for curly hair there 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.330
 yes because it will not suffer like we are going to 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 obviously use after the shampoo 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.350
 we squeeze a little of the hair 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.420
 we apply that conditioning in what 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.360
 make your face your body or wash your 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.310
 body and right there in the shower 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.810
 use your wonderful comb that also 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.630
 I bring it that already our friends what 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.080
 they have 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.790
 and in the shower unravel your hair what 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.740
 what you 're going to avoid is that when you 're 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.050
 If it's dry, your hair is 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.970
 waiting with him to unravel and 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.090
 then the skeins of 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.220
 not hair but really coconut which is what 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.860
 that contains the conditioner because 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.390
 like they're not going practically 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.400
 There are nine singers that will allow 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.920
 that you can untangle what they are 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 avoiding that you want your hair and what 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 you can untangle without any problem 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.130
 thing is that the shampoo does not have and this 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.690
 question do I do it because several times 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.240
 and from various sources and sometime what 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.239
 I tried and if it worked, they recommended that 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.130
 use instead of conditioner a 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 well-known brand to your list of 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.239
 softener for ahead 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.610
 and I say that I would not do it because I would not 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.300
 is intended the air dices are not 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.800
 intended for your hair but for 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.139
 textiles by then I do not 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.000
 sincerely I recommend it further 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.759
 it would be an immense aggressiveness for you 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.009
 for your hair not then now you are 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.229
 people who have thin hair and 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.759
 little that you think we suggest 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.979
 a sphere that I bring here too 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.889
 are those edits that help us comb 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.840
 if you come out of the shower you have a 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.699
 deserved your hair and you put it not of 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.880
 means to ends but only in the 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.130
 tips and eyes and if your hair is in 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.949
 layers I separated those layers is used 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.409
 only at the tips and you'll see that what 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.940
 you're going to unravel amazing is not going to 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.009
 affect your hair because it really 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.590
 when people have it scarce and 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.720
 thin suffer because he obviously gets 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.300
 the conditioner and they get thinner 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.520
 and is prone to falling 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.290
 also then what do you think that look 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.170
 we press in the shower right there 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.870
 we brush dry with the washcloth in 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.280
 you touch and there she is as healers 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.650
 few that come a little bit like in 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.570
 spray and they are for when you leave the 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.450
 shower with wet hair nothing more 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.070
 I do not love them that's how I love them and I'm 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.500
 I suggest that you can use them for 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.930
 example these people that I tell you or in 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.300
 the case of Pauline who had very hair 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.790
 curly also with that is supported for 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.730
 be able to unravel out of the shower 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.520
 now very important if you have a 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.500
 event a wedding 15 years you are a godmother or 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.850
 you are the protagonist of the party and 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.310
 you are very used to using 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.200
 conditioner on the day of your event 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.900
 please do not use it although it costs you a 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.610
 little bit of work unraveling that's going to 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.740
 give permanence to the hairstyle that you 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.720
 Make your stylist so that the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.190
 combed the whole party as it is 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.260
 special you have it because how do you 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.520
 you dedicate to water to thank you very much if it is 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.990
 a nightmare when you arrive and you 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.790
 you find a girlfriend that hair swims 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.289
 more so there is no way to review it 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.819
 then he wishes 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.740
 the itinerary that we are talking about 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.330
 we are giving them instructions and 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.669
 one of those is that since the day of 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.770
 test do not use the conditioner and 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.749
 There are no people on the day of the event 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.399
 that they put on the mask and they do 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.099
 a thousand things in the hair in the same 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.869
 week of your wedding that believe me you're going 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.270
 to serve perfect if they do 20 days 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.339
 before and will have the same result 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.619
 same brightness because the products are 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:50.439
 designed for that however the day of 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.240
 your wedding please do not use it I'll 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:58.539
 I guarantee that your hairstyle will have 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.129
 the permanence of the whole party and 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.050
 He ended us has a growing base 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.149
 quickly about biotin serves to 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.919
 Isolate hair loss to avoid 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:07.419
 the fall and also hair loss 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.089
 biotin if we can recommend it not 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.409
 I know that the women who marveled 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:12.819
 they just had babies and they were 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.729
 lactating that hair is falling 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:18.930
 frighteningly take biotin recommended 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.930
 even out of compassion 

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:26.259
 they say what I told them because if then 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.940
 return to a hand is once in the long run 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.240
 same and ends without coffee 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:33.700
 no no no we do not want to have thousandths 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.390
 for those advice given the continuous 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.390
 vomiting
