00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
thinking
beside<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> box<00:02:14.550> well<00:02:14.940> rocket<00:02:15.629> stove<00:02:15.810> was

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
beside the box well rocket stove was

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
beside the box well rocket stove was
really<00:02:16.140> nice<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.640> could<00:02:17.790> put<00:02:17.940> them<00:02:18.030> together

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
really nice you could put them together

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.940 
really nice you could put them together
for<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.900> hundred<00:02:18.989> two<00:02:19.260> hundred<00:02:19.290> dollars<00:02:19.799> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
for one hundred two hundred dollars of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.789 
for one hundred two hundred dollars of
materials<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.519> have<00:02:20.549> laying<00:02:20.790> around<00:02:20.849> but<00:02:21.799> why

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
materials you have laying around but why

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.000 
materials you have laying around but why
use<00:02:23.720> expensive<00:02:24.720> material<00:02:25.409> when<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.799> just

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
use expensive material when you can just

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.820 
use expensive material when you can just
use<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.730> ground<00:02:27.319> you<00:02:28.319> know<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.470> takes<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.709> lot

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
use the ground you know it takes a lot

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.350 
use the ground you know it takes a lot
of<00:02:28.950> time<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:30.750> things<00:02:30.989> like<00:02:31.790> mix<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:32.940> cob<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
of time to do things like mix up cob and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.050 
of time to do things like mix up cob and
whatnot<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.220> thought<00:02:35.220> well<00:02:35.430> there's<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
whatnot so I thought well there's the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
whatnot so I thought well there's the
idea<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.420> Dakota<00:02:36.720> fire<00:02:36.930> hole<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.410> there's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
idea of a Dakota fire hole where there's

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
idea of a Dakota fire hole where there's
a<00:02:37.650> Dakota<00:02:37.920> fire<00:02:38.099> hole<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.610> used<00:02:38.790> 60-inch

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
a Dakota fire hole I just used 60-inch

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.100 
a Dakota fire hole I just used 60-inch
stovepipe<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.370> said<00:02:41.549> an<00:02:41.670> elbow<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.870> first

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
stovepipe like I said an elbow the first

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.539 
stovepipe like I said an elbow the first
thing<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.470> right<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:43.920> an<00:02:44.069> elbow<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
thing on the right there's an elbow and

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.059 
thing on the right there's an elbow and
then<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.760> goes<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.360> tee<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:46.769> elbow<00:02:47.010> is

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
then it goes into a tee the elbow is

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.430 
then it goes into a tee the elbow is
your<00:02:47.220> field<00:02:47.400> poured<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.329> tea<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.959> burn

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
your field poured the tea is the burn

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.030 
your field poured the tea is the burn
the<00:02:50.370> cooking<00:02:50.760> chamber<00:02:51.090> cooking<00:02:51.690> port<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the cooking chamber cooking port and I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.039 
the cooking chamber cooking port and I
could<00:02:53.220> put<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.109> I've<00:02:55.200> got<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:57.049> paint

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
could put a right here I've got a paint

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.880 
could put a right here I've got a paint
can<00:02:58.549> it's<00:02:59.549> got<00:02:59.730> water<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.650> paints<00:03:01.650> already

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
can it's got water in it paints already

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.520 
can it's got water in it paints already
burned<00:03:02.069> off<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.549> out<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.379> can

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
burned off of it out of it and I can

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:15.979 
burned off of it out of it and I can
just<00:03:04.680> put<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> cook<00:03:14.720> pretty<00:03:15.720> neat

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.270 
just put that there and cook pretty neat
so<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.349> do<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.560> laying<00:03:16.799> around<00:03:16.920> we'll

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so what do you have laying around we'll

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
so what do you have laying around we'll
build<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.549> rocket<00:03:17.819> stove<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.690> got<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
build a rocket stove out of it you got a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.539 
build a rocket stove out of it you got a
lot<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.019> dirt<00:03:19.290> most<00:03:19.859> people<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.280> dirt<00:03:20.459> on

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
lot of dirt most people have dirt on

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.940 
lot of dirt most people have dirt on
their<00:03:20.700> property<00:03:21.260> build<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.349> rocket<00:03:22.590> stove<00:03:22.739> out

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
their property build a rocket stove out

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.680 
their property build a rocket stove out
of<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.560> trench<00:03:25.560> or<00:03:26.690> in-ground

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
of it this is a trench or in-ground

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.170 
of it this is a trench or in-ground
rocket<00:03:28.139> stove<00:03:28.380> that's<00:03:29.220> all<00:03:29.489> thermal<00:03:29.730> mess<00:03:30.000> I'm

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
rocket stove that's all thermal mess I'm

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.250 
rocket stove that's all thermal mess I'm
gonna<00:03:30.299> finish<00:03:30.599> covering<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.109> that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
gonna finish covering up that

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.339 
gonna finish covering up that
installation<00:03:32.120> I'm<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.269> actually<00:03:33.930> lift<00:03:34.230> it

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
installation I'm gonna actually lift it

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.539 
installation I'm gonna actually lift it
up<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.560> level<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:34.889> out<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.099> little<00:03:35.190> bit<00:03:35.310> more

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
up and level it out a little bit more

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.729 
up and level it out a little bit more
the<00:03:36.030> idea<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.410> ground<00:03:37.650> was

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
the idea is you know the ground was

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.960 
the idea is you know the ground was
heated<00:03:38.010> up<00:03:38.099> right<00:03:38.280> across<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.790> you've

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
heated up right across here and you've

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110 
heated up right across here and you've
got<00:03:39.150> about<00:03:39.239> eight<00:03:39.959> feet<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.639> heated<00:03:41.639> earth<00:03:41.790> to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
got about eight feet of heated earth to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.839 
got about eight feet of heated earth to
sleep<00:03:42.359> on<00:03:42.540> when<00:03:43.019> you're<00:03:43.139> done<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:44.579> could<00:03:44.760> be

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
sleep on when you're done this could be

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.699 
sleep on when you're done this could be
a<00:03:44.880> Walmart<00:03:45.359> in<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.780> doesn't<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.290> be<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> G

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
a Walmart in it doesn't have to be a G

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.319 
a Walmart in it doesn't have to be a G
that's<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.980> coma<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.519> anything<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.269> could

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
that's a coma can be anything it could

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.210 
that's a coma can be anything it could
actually<00:03:48.510> be<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> cardboard<00:03:49.049> box<00:03:49.410> if<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.799> some

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
actually be a cardboard box if you some

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.120 
actually be a cardboard box if you some
people<00:03:50.630> live<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.750> cardboard<00:03:52.019> boxes<00:03:52.200> well<00:03:52.980> they

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
people live in cardboard boxes well they

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.470 
people live in cardboard boxes well they
could<00:03:53.250> build<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.489> trench<00:03:53.700> Rock<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.940> stove<00:03:54.239> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
could build a trench Rock a stove and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.470 
could build a trench Rock a stove and
have<00:03:54.810> warmth<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.790> no<00:03:58.010> smoke<00:03:59.010> inside

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
have warmth and have no smoke inside

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.030 
have warmth and have no smoke inside
build<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.629> right<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.319> can<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.620> that's<00:04:01.799> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
build it right you can see that's the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.550 
build it right you can see that's the
burn<00:04:02.190> chamber<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.750> there's<00:04:03.989> no<00:04:04.109> smoke<00:04:04.349> coming

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
burn chamber and there's no smoke coming

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.399 
burn chamber and there's no smoke coming
out<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.859> at<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.160> so

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.220

pretty awesome little deal a little bit

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.989 
pretty awesome little deal a little bit
of<00:04:11.290> insulation<00:04:11.530> sticking<00:04:12.040> up<00:04:12.129> there<00:04:12.280> right<00:04:12.879> at

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:12.999 
of insulation sticking up there right at

out of the dome I'm gonna again pull

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.469 
out of the dome I'm gonna again pull
that<00:04:17.680> up<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.070> level<00:04:18.789> that<00:04:18.910> off<00:04:19.030> dig<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.299> dirt

up and then lay that down under the dirt
and<00:04:21.820> then<00:04:21.910> put<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.180> dirt<00:04:22.330> back<00:04:22.509> on<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.870> so

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and then put the dirt back on it so

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.490 
and then put the dirt back on it so
you'd<00:04:23.979> be<00:04:24.100> sleeping<00:04:24.340> on<00:04:25.410> insulated<00:04:27.419> ground<00:04:28.500> in

side of the trench and there's also

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.659 
side of the trench and there's also
somewhat<00:04:53.530> old<00:04:53.680> insulation<00:04:54.280> in<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.669> that

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.120 

so<00:05:00.669> once<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.360> earth<00:05:01.630> heats<00:05:01.870> up<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.410> uh<00:05:02.440> it

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
so once that earth heats up it uh it

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.950 
so once that earth heats up it uh it
warms<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.520> up<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:03.940> gets<00:05:04.210> real<00:05:04.539> good<00:05:04.720> draw

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
warms it up and that gets real good draw

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.860 
warms it up and that gets real good draw
it<00:05:05.500> maintains<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.099> good<00:05:06.310> draw<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:07.750> you've

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
it maintains that good draw and you've

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.950 
it maintains that good draw and you've
got<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.080> nice<00:05:08.620> warm<00:05:09.039> place<00:05:09.389> cooking<00:05:10.389> inside<00:05:10.720> no

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
got a nice warm place cooking inside no

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.670 
got a nice warm place cooking inside no
smoke<00:05:11.430> heated<00:05:12.430> inside<00:05:12.820> with<00:05:13.030> no<00:05:13.180> smoke<00:05:13.680> once

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
smoke heated inside with no smoke once

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.170 
smoke heated inside with no smoke once
the<00:05:14.770> ground<00:05:14.979> heat<00:05:15.159> up<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.430> fire<00:05:15.639> goes<00:05:15.849> out<00:05:15.970> the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
the ground heat up the fire goes out the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.399 
the ground heat up the fire goes out the
ground<00:05:16.360> was<00:05:16.449> gonna<00:05:16.539> stay<00:05:16.780> warm<00:05:16.990> for<00:05:17.229> quite<00:05:17.380> a

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
ground was gonna stay warm for quite a

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.330 
ground was gonna stay warm for quite a
while<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:18.599> that's<00:05:19.599> your<00:05:19.840> thermal<00:05:20.139> mass<00:05:20.340> you

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
while and that's your thermal mass you

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.860 
while and that's your thermal mass you
could<00:05:21.490> build<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.789> a<00:05:21.880> bench<00:05:22.120> with<00:05:22.330> rocks<00:05:22.630> and

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
could build up a bench with rocks and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.540 
could build up a bench with rocks and
stuff<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.259> sit<00:05:23.440> on<00:05:23.470> it<00:05:23.740> whatever<00:05:24.159> you<00:05:24.370> wanted

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
stuff and sit on it whatever you wanted

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.210 
stuff and sit on it whatever you wanted
to<00:05:24.610> do<00:05:24.789> so<00:05:25.680> there<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.800> go

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
to do so there you go

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.870 
to do so there you go
what<00:05:27.669> do<00:05:27.729> you<00:05:27.820> have<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.810> plain<00:05:29.259> view<00:05:29.880> think

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
what do you have in plain view think

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.899 
what do you have in plain view think
outside<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.300> box<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:32.949> a<00:05:32.979> cheap<00:05:33.699> way<00:05:33.880> to

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
outside the box this is a cheap way to

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.820 
outside the box this is a cheap way to
go<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.210> have<00:05:34.449> heat<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.720> warmth<00:05:35.409> through<00:05:35.710> the

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
go to have heat and warmth through the

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.070 
go to have heat and warmth through the
winter
