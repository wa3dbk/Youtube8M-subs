00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.010
 hi us to 3 years 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.990
 today I'm going 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.560
 I will tell you a little bit worthy of the keyboard the ultimate blackwidow x 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:11.109
 rasters 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 so that I had the chance to receive to be able to test it 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.269
 in this video I will see him 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 we do a little bit the different possibilities 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 we show a little design so there you see 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.210
 it's quite nice 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.710
 so the keyboard is like that to plug it so you have 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 so need a year of an audio port 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.370
 daba micro usb port 2 usb ports the usb port and so then for the power supply and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
 others precisely to be able to use the second one here 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.010
 which is directly on the keyboard 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.540
 you may not see them but there is also a gold pekin audio port 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.890
 for microsoft mans 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.780
 to accelerate these connections are necessary 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.060
 so that the vantage this physical keyboard 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.870
 we attacked by macros 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.500
 so that are configurable 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.760
 because to a software 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 as to the troubles 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.330
 the fire could also be set up directly on the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 club is good it's a little more difficult 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.850
 cleaner dead 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 Khelil 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640
 so there we speak again the lock of mexico 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 the film label years 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.660
 simply because you have to activate them 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.360
 why the points 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.159
 we have a quality group 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.040
 all three 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 so pretty design 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.220
 the storm hits 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.630
 therefore in that it constitutes 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.830
 the mobile of the keyboard 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.060
 it's a great match actions in fact it only affects one dose 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.350
 when you're at stake that can sometimes be very boring 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.710
 so we are not afraid of words so we pepsi a little all-way 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.840
 bowling which is named so various keyboard functions 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.170
 like for example in marble I showed you the man 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.290
 touchette m 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 above we have the touch 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.060
 less than ten minutes 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.060
 as for the little icon that appears so there the key or disable it 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.599
 if we also have macros mode right next to it but for that 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.889
 we have to stay there since 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.449
 b activated it is everywhere you can create your steps too 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.159
 saab's activities would be even a little bit needed 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.649
 so we still have 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.299
 then go to bed early 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.589
 this is the key for the day before can not predict you if we will not say 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.799
 not but because we are logical 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.060
 we have keys for the so are multimedia keys so populated cause 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.929
 from childhood 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.469
 changchun treasure hunt 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.579
 but we also have lighting it's a little wiser 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 so show it so our activities 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.889
 you have five levels of brightness they were only four that moment 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.269
 the digital is not terrible 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.949
 so that's it that's pretty much everything for the functions 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.569
 of the keyboard 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.139
 the keyboard is not lightweight 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.899
 the moon that denis plant appreciates days I'll rather talk to you about it 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:14.089
 in the article on the blog 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.989
 So here is 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:15.610
 See you soon
