late<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:44.050> it<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.860> it's<00:01:45.009> always<00:01:45.190> too<00:01:45.520> late<00:01:45.700> so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
late is it and it's always too late so

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.359 
late is it and it's always too late so
what<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.990> one<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.560> what's<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.160> most

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
what what is one of the what's the most

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.279 
what what is one of the what's the most
important<00:01:49.000> thing<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.330> want<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.630> know<00:01:49.780> if<00:01:50.080> I'm

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
important thing I want to know if I'm

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.050 
important thing I want to know if I'm
gonna<00:01:50.440> buy<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.649> big<00:01:50.950> brake<00:01:51.220> kit<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:51.640> Mike<00:01:51.759> let's

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
gonna buy a big brake kit for Mike let's

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.330 
gonna buy a big brake kit for Mike let's
talk<00:01:52.240> about<00:01:52.390> what<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.690> mean<00:01:52.990> by<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.560> improve

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
talk about what you mean by a improve

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.800 
talk about what you mean by a improve
break<00:01:54.580> or<00:01:54.789> big<00:01:54.940> break<00:01:55.210> because<00:01:55.509> there's<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> lot

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
break or big break because there's a lot

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.210 
break or big break because there's a lot
of<00:01:55.960> different<00:01:56.080> things<00:01:56.380> that<00:01:56.740> fall<00:01:56.950> into<00:01:57.070> that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
of different things that fall into that

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.279 
of different things that fall into that
category<00:01:57.280> okay<00:01:58.149> so<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.539> first<00:01:58.570> thing<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.170> have

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
category okay so the first thing I have

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.010 
category okay so the first thing I have
a<00:01:59.350> car<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.590> wanted<00:01:59.800> to<00:02:00.009> stop<00:02:00.310> better<00:02:00.580> yeah<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.149> if

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
a car I wanted to stop better yeah I if

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.870 
a car I wanted to stop better yeah I if
you're<00:02:02.320> going<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.890> want<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.100> stop<00:02:03.340> better<00:02:03.580> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
you're going to want to stop better and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.540 
you're going to want to stop better and
you<00:02:04.000> want<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.270> go<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.780> extreme<00:02:05.319> you<00:02:06.220> can<00:02:06.399> go

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
you want to go to the extreme you can go

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.510 
you want to go to the extreme you can go
all<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.850> way<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:08.350> our<00:02:08.590> case<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:08.920> build<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
all the way to in our case we build a

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.840 
all the way to in our case we build a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
forged monoblock six piston on a 15 inch

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
forged monoblock six piston on a 15 inch
rotor<00:02:13.150> that'll<00:02:13.930> stop<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.099> hit<00:02:15.550> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
rotor that'll stop you like you hit a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.210 
rotor that'll stop you like you hit a
wall<00:02:15.819> yeah<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.870> lot<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.230> guys<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
wall yeah but a lot of guys have a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
wall yeah but a lot of guys have a
wheelset<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.360> they've<00:02:19.480> already<00:02:19.630> selected

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
wheelset that they've already selected

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.830 
wheelset that they've already selected
or<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:20.650> have<00:02:21.030> desired<00:02:22.030> look<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.630> car

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
or they have desired look for the car

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.870 
or they have desired look for the car
period<00:02:23.319> piece<00:02:23.590> those<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.190> things<00:02:24.340> we

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
period piece those kind of things we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.860 
period piece those kind of things we
build<00:02:25.120> brakes<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.569> lot<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.840> different

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
build brakes to a lot of different

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.690 
build brakes to a lot of different
categories<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.740> fit<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.160> from<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.610> I've

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
categories to fit that from what I've

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.059 
categories to fit that from what I've
heard<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.200> please<00:02:29.500> direct<00:02:29.890> me<00:02:29.950> if

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
heard and you can please direct me if

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.740 
heard and you can please direct me if
I'm<00:02:30.190> wrong<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.760> drilled<00:02:31.060> rotors<00:02:31.330> are

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
I'm wrong is the drilled rotors are

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.199 
I'm wrong is the drilled rotors are
lighter<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> ventilate<00:02:33.220> better<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.030> that

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
lighter and ventilate better but that

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.480 
lighter and ventilate better but that
the<00:02:34.390> slotted<00:02:34.990> rotors<00:02:35.380> are<00:02:35.560> more<00:02:35.770> durable<00:02:36.069> and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
the slotted rotors are more durable and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.160 
the slotted rotors are more durable and
have<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> better<00:02:36.970> friction<00:02:37.569> surface<00:02:37.959> for

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
have a better friction surface for

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.290 
have a better friction surface for
stopping<00:02:38.709> well<00:02:39.400> there<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.270> very

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
stopping well there really is very

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.910 
stopping well there really is very
little<00:02:40.930> change<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> weight<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
little change in the weight and the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.890 
little change in the weight and the
rotor<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> drilling<00:02:42.790> there<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.540> really

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
rotor with the drilling there is really

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500 
rotor with the drilling there is really
not<00:02:44.890> cooling<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.670> comes<00:02:45.910> from<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.209> drilling

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
not cooling that comes from the drilling

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.229 
not cooling that comes from the drilling
it's<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.140> gas<00:02:47.380> pathway<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.580> slot<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.060> for

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
it's just a gas pathway the slot is for

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's just a gas pathway the slot is for
the<00:02:49.300> same<00:02:49.510> reason<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:50.319> helps<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.770> relieve<00:02:51.069> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the same reason it helps to relieve the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.370 
the same reason it helps to relieve the
gas<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.849> built<00:02:52.090> up<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> bonding<00:02:53.050> agents

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
gas is built up when the bonding agents

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.330 
gas is built up when the bonding agents
from<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.530> pad<00:02:53.770> break<00:02:54.099> down<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.209> provides<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
from the pad break down so it provides a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.910 
from the pad break down so it provides a
place<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.580> ventilate<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.020> gases<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.800> that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
place to ventilate the the gases so that

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.580 
place to ventilate the the gases so that
there's<00:03:00.099> not<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> boundary<00:03:00.760> layer<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.209> that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
there's not a boundary layer that that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.770 
there's not a boundary layer that that
reduces<00:03:02.590> friction<00:03:02.830> yeah<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.520> far<00:03:04.330> as<00:03:04.360> one

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
reduces friction yeah as far as one

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.830 
reduces friction yeah as far as one
versus<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.290> other<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:06.250> terms<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.840> reliability

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
versus the other in terms of reliability

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.750 
versus the other in terms of reliability
and<00:03:08.469> one

yes<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.959> times<00:03:10.140> people<00:03:10.379> recommend<00:03:11.189> only

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
to do with it yeah I don't know how many

times a year you get out on the track

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.910 
times a year you get out on the track
and<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.239> don't<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.540> hot<00:03:48.780> enough<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> almost

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and I don't know hot enough but I almost

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.920 
and I don't know hot enough but I almost
hit<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.220> dog<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.760> other<00:03:50.790> day<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.389> was<00:03:51.420> really

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
hit a dog the other day and I was really

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.539 
hit a dog the other day and I was really
glad<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.170> had<00:03:52.470> those<00:03:52.650> brakes<00:03:52.980> are<00:03:53.159> you<00:03:53.220> going<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
glad I had those brakes are you going to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.220 
glad I had those brakes are you going to
work<00:03:53.700> really<00:03:53.970> well<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.540> what<00:03:54.659> you<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:54.959> want

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
work really well so what you really want

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.830 
work really well so what you really want
is<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.769> control<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.670> pedal<00:03:57.000> also<00:03:57.420> of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
is the control at the pedal also of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.809 
is the control at the pedal also of
being<00:03:58.139> able<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.349> reach<00:03:58.590> closer<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.489> point

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
being able to reach closer to that point

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.699 
being able to reach closer to that point
and<00:04:00.000> sustain<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.720> over<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.959> longer<00:04:01.170> period<00:04:01.319> of

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
and sustain it over a longer period of

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.729 
and sustain it over a longer period of
time<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.639> answer<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.450> although<00:04:04.109> at

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
time so the answer is that although at

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.830 
time so the answer is that although at
30<00:04:05.250> miles<00:04:05.459> an<00:04:05.639> hour<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.120> may<00:04:06.450> be<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.659> case

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
30 miles an hour that may be the case

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.280 
30 miles an hour that may be the case
that<00:04:07.680> yeah<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.609> car<00:04:08.909> is<00:04:09.299> limited<00:04:09.840> by<00:04:09.959> what<00:04:09.989> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
that yeah one car is limited by what the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.890 
that yeah one car is limited by what the
tire<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.220> not<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.670> case<00:04:11.819> at<00:04:12.000> 130<00:04:12.690> miles

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
tire is it's not the case at 130 miles

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.180 
tire is it's not the case at 130 miles
an<00:04:13.079> hour<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.859> becomes<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.609> bit<00:04:15.480> more<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.989> a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
an hour and it becomes a bit more of a

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.770 
an hour and it becomes a bit more of a
necessity<00:04:17.190> when<00:04:17.820> your<00:04:17.970> lifestyle<00:04:18.539> is

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
necessity when your lifestyle is

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.469 
necessity when your lifestyle is
traveling<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.889> would<00:04:20.160> yeah<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.880> if<00:04:21.389> you're
