00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.420
 I 'm going to make you a Paraguayan soup with 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.610
 polenta ready soon is to say the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.799
 polenta that is cooked in a minute and 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.400
 apart I do not use the homemade cheese but 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.160
 used a creamy cheese is not original not 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.120
 tell me later that it is trout 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.110
 but it is practical 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.670
 and if you are well browned it is rich 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.800
 three portions of milk and one of polenta 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.740
 600 grams of chopped onion 3 eggs 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.760
 shakes and bites we are going to chop the 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.460
 Onion does not need to be very 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 finite the onion that we had 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.470
 in formosa with my husband giving classes in 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.820
 lagoon white area is and 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.410
 buenavista that is typically 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.809
 Paraguayan idiosyncrasy if anyone sees me 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.140
 from Formosa they saw that I learned 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.410
 sick make their soup and then 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.470
 We fry but a little bit I will not fly 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.890
 you have to brown and sautÃ© something that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.650
 throw them on the water the onion and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.490
 there it is not gilded it does not hurt so much 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.610
 Meanwhile I will oil the mold 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.260
 I put the fried link but not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.630
 stick it after I put a little bit of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.840
 oil a little 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.390
 do not exaggerate now we are going to add 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.390
 milk and let's put 3 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.009
 3 of milk very well and we will add 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 1 of polenta look like it thickens and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.890
 we have to add also after 3 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.140
 beaten eggs we received a little 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.770
 I hope when they see that and cut the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.480
 star is let's leave this that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 repose 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.830
 a little while look how it absorbs milk 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.870
 look how the pasta is that does not 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.550
 connected to the amount I want this 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.560
 you will say because the thick peak 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.619
 choking gray or because I'm going to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 work with the hand I fly the cheese 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.290
 inside then there is not a piece of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 cheese in a place after polenta saw 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.860
 how it dies everything beautiful what 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.350
 now we are going to put it in a 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.110
 asadera 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.680
 we put it in the oven but notice that the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.490
 oven is not very strong control in ones 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.990
 20 minutes and I come and watch and until it 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.030
 gild 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.540
 and there it is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.909
 the umbrella soup 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.579
 have to wait for it to cool down this is 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.760
 a cake you have to wait five days 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.450
 minutes that you get out of the bush look how 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.840
 it will look 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.400
 Y 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.489
 british 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.489
 and
