some<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> random<00:00:51.420> set<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.960> only

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
some kind of random set which I only

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
some kind of random set which I only
didn't<00:00:52.620> anticipate<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.030> case<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
didn't anticipate in the case is the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.590 
didn't anticipate in the case is the
trace<00:00:55.020> set<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.280> technically<00:00:56.760> based<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
trace set which is technically based so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
trace set which is technically based so
I<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> name<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.489> do

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
because he's bullet seed now the problem

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
because he's bullet seed now the problem
is<00:01:02.010> Elise<00:01:02.280> marvelton<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.180> thing<00:01:03.210> is

have<00:01:31.079> anything<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.680> take<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> fire<00:01:32.850> move<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
have anything to take a fire move so I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.700 
have anything to take a fire move so I
just<00:01:33.360> wanted<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.900> pull<00:01:34.200> us<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
just wanted to go into pull us out and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130 
just wanted to go into pull us out and
because<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> rain<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.049> rain

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because I can make it rain make it rain

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
because I can make it rain make it rain

Linda hose I can resist a fiber should

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.420 
Linda hose I can resist a fiber should
he<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:40.890> decides<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.400> for

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
he go for it but he decides to go for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
he go for it but he decides to go for
the<00:01:41.670> cover<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:42.090> smart<00:01:42.450> play<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the cover don't smart play because you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
the cover don't smart play because you
know<00:01:43.439> he<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> then

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know he can get one up on me and then

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
know he can get one up on me and then
basically<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.549> we've<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> isn't

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
basically go for and we've that isn't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
basically go for and we've that isn't

the score was a hydro pump then I would

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
the score was a hydro pump then I would
have<00:01:56.369> polygon<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.750> course

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
have polygon for that but the course

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
have polygon for that but the course
code<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.560> less<00:01:58.829> base<00:01:59.250> power<00:01:59.549> than<00:01:59.729> hydro<00:02:00.119> pump

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
had got confused and then I switched up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
had got confused and then I switched up
into<00:02:54.120> my<00:02:54.600> elder<00:02:54.990> which<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> don't<00:02:55.410> like

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
anymore because conch Gator doesn't seem

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.460 
anymore because conch Gator doesn't seem

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
to work for me I don't know why but it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.590 
to work for me I don't know why but it
just<00:02:58.500> doesn't<00:02:59.000> yeah<00:03:00.000> my<00:03:00.210> conquered<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
just doesn't yeah my conquered I

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.110 
just doesn't yeah my conquered I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
wouldn't have got hit him by this bug

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.490 
wouldn't have got hit him by this bug
was<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.690> he<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:04.020> actually<00:03:04.170> attack

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
was because he would actually attack

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
was because he would actually attack

I'm hoping for it not to be more than

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
I'm hoping for it not to be more than
two<00:03:34.950> hits<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.520> if<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.820> more<00:03:36.360> than<00:03:36.420> two

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
two hits because if it is more than two

up<00:04:52.610> my<00:04:52.759> pillow<00:04:52.940> talk<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.509> a<00:04:53.629> step<00:04:53.900> further

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
up my pillow talk just a step further

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.779 
up my pillow talk just a step further
because<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.440> know<00:04:54.560> he's<00:04:55.009> gonna<00:04:55.190> want<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.610> try

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
because I know he's gonna want to try

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.219 
because I know he's gonna want to try
and<00:04:55.880> go<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.150> Thunder<00:04:56.449> seen<00:04:56.990> as<00:04:57.110> his

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
and go for the Thunder seen as his

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.980 
and go for the Thunder seen as his
raining<00:04:57.530> that's<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.889> most<00:04:58.099> probable

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
raining that's the most probable

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.760 
raining that's the most probable
situation<00:04:59.990> move<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:01.840> he<00:05:02.840> gets<00:05:03.020> useless<00:05:03.409> crit

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
situation move so he gets useless crit

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.770 
situation move so he gets useless crit
which<00:05:04.069> totally<00:05:04.490> murdered<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.000> I<00:05:05.449> would<00:05:05.659> have

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
which totally murdered and I would have

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.270 
which totally murdered and I would have
been<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:06.050> live<00:05:06.169> that<00:05:06.349> if<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.680> wouldn't<00:05:06.889> if<00:05:07.009> it

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
been to live that if it wouldn't if it

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.059 
been to live that if it wouldn't if it
hadn't<00:05:07.550> been<00:05:07.580> for<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.819> crit<00:05:08.090> but<00:05:08.840> now<00:05:09.590> he<00:05:09.650> are

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
hadn't been for the crit but now he are

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.800 
hadn't been for the crit but now he are
going<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.400> jirachi<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:11.000> here's<00:05:11.210> where<00:05:11.509> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
going to jirachi and here's where the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.779 
going to jirachi and here's where the
plus<00:05:12.080> two<00:05:12.349> plus<00:05:12.380> one<00:05:12.800> thing<00:05:13.220> comes<00:05:13.430> into<00:05:13.639> play

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
plus two plus one thing comes into play

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.510 
plus two plus one thing comes into play
because<00:05:14.449> if<00:05:14.870> he's<00:05:15.050> at<00:05:15.199> plus-2<00:05:15.500> he<00:05:16.310> should

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
because if he's at plus-2 he should

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.640 
because if he's at plus-2 he should
really<00:05:16.699> do<00:05:16.819> more<00:05:17.030> than<00:05:17.120> half<00:05:17.419> but<00:05:18.199> I'm<00:05:18.380> living

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
really do more than half but I'm living

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.010 
really do more than half but I'm living
that<00:05:18.740> green<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.400> really<00:05:19.789> he<00:05:20.120> still<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.569> plus<00:05:20.750> one

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
that green so really he still a plus one

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.899 
that green so really he still a plus one
so<00:05:21.289> I'm<00:05:21.949> not<00:05:22.069> really<00:05:22.129> sure<00:05:22.280> what<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.819> the

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
so I'm not really sure what to the

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.600 
so I'm not really sure what to the
download<00:05:23.210> mechanics<00:05:23.659> is<00:05:23.930> going<00:05:24.259> on<00:05:24.319> in<00:05:24.500> 15<00:05:24.650> but

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
download mechanics is going on in 15 but

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.839 
download mechanics is going on in 15 but
there<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.449> get<00:05:26.719> paralyzed<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.669> look<00:05:28.669> at<00:05:28.789> this

bandage whenever I brought it in I would

bandage whenever I brought it in I would
have<00:06:16.170> been<00:06:16.260> at<00:06:16.380> plus<00:06:16.590> 1<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.100> this<00:06:17.700> gene<00:06:18.000> stick

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
have been at plus 1 and this gene stick

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.730 
have been at plus 1 and this gene stick
right<00:06:18.480> here<00:06:18.510> should<00:06:18.960> have<00:06:19.080> been<00:06:19.230> paralyzed

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
right here should have been paralyzed

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.140 
right here should have been paralyzed
because<00:06:19.920> as<00:06:20.190> I<00:06:20.220> said<00:06:20.370> when<00:06:20.580> I<00:06:20.640> go<00:06:20.760> for<00:06:20.940> fund

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
because as I said when I go for fund

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.600 
because as I said when I go for fund
away<00:06:21.270> for<00:06:21.390> myself<00:06:21.720> which<00:06:22.440> means<00:06:22.800> this<00:06:22.950> dataset

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
away for myself which means this dataset

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.890 
away for myself which means this dataset
would<00:06:23.940> have<00:06:24.030> been<00:06:24.120> crippled<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:24.690> then<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:24.840> just

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
would have been crippled and then I just

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.380 
would have been crippled and then I just
go<00:06:25.200> for<00:06:25.230> a<00:06:25.470> funder<00:06:25.800> because<00:06:26.100> I<00:06:26.280> know<00:06:26.820> after

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
go for a funder because I know after

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.010 
go for a funder because I know after
plus<00:06:27.990> one<00:06:28.350> in<00:06:29.070> special<00:06:29.520> tag<00:06:29.670> and<00:06:29.970> you'll<00:06:30.780> see

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
plus one in special tag and you'll see

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.250 
plus one in special tag and you'll see
it<00:06:31.140> for<00:06:31.290> reference<00:06:31.410> to<00:06:31.770> that<00:06:32.550> my<00:06:33.060> gene<00:06:33.600> sect<00:06:33.990> is

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
it for reference to that my gene sect is

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.680 
it for reference to that my gene sect is
gonna<00:06:34.620> one<00:06:35.070> short<00:06:35.370> everything<00:06:35.790> on<00:06:36.240> his<00:06:36.420> team

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
gonna one short everything on his team

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.650 
gonna one short everything on his team
barbarella<00:06:37.320> with<00:06:37.530> a<00:06:37.560> fondle<00:06:38.040> so<00:06:39.000> here's<00:06:39.450> where

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
barbarella with a fondle so here's where

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.450 
barbarella with a fondle so here's where
the<00:06:39.780> referent<00:06:40.230> referential<00:06:40.800> thing<00:06:41.220> comes

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
the referent referential thing comes

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.740 
the referent referential thing comes
into<00:06:41.730> play<00:06:41.880> yeah<00:06:42.120> she's<00:06:42.270> gonna<00:06:42.360> switch<00:06:42.600> out

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
into play yeah she's gonna switch out

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.270 
into play yeah she's gonna switch out
cuz<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.080> know<00:06:43.170> she<00:06:43.230> has<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.500> game<00:06:43.650> he<00:06:43.800> can

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
cuz you know she has the game he can

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.220 
cuz you know she has the game he can
just<00:06:44.400> bring<00:06:44.550> up<00:06:44.670> his<00:06:44.850> theater<00:06:45.630> and<00:06:45.780> thunder<00:06:46.050> me
