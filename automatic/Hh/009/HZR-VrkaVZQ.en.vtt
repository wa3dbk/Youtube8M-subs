it
like<00:00:30.090> never<00:00:30.300> beating<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:30.869> kids<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.529> almost

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
like never beating your kids it's almost

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620 
like never beating your kids it's almost
always<00:00:32.189> better<00:00:32.550> than<00:00:32.759> beating<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.180> later<00:00:33.390> in

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
always better than beating them later in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
always better than beating them later in
today's<00:00:33.899> review<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.260> give<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.710> two<00:00:34.770> cents<00:00:35.219> on

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
today's review I give my two cents on

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
today's review I give my two cents on
this<00:00:35.520> case<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> ultimately<00:00:36.270> decide<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this case and ultimately decide if it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
this case and ultimately decide if it's
worth<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> tedious<00:00:38.100> upgrade<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> 600<00:00:39.239> T

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
worth the tedious upgrade from the 600 T

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.880 
worth the tedious upgrade from the 600 T
so<00:00:39.870> let's<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so let's get down to it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350 
so let's get down to it
cosmetically<00:00:41.460> speaking<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.120> first

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
cosmetically speaking my first

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
cosmetically speaking my first
impression<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> 780<00:00:43.320> T<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.829> its<00:00:43.980> bulky

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370

600 T itself was oversized for being a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.170 
600 T itself was oversized for being a
mid<00:00:49.469> tower<00:00:49.649> case<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.399> still<00:00:50.579> looks<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:50.969> an

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mid tower case but still looks like an

of the case is still made of plastic but

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.319 
of the case is still made of plastic but
takes<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.190> aggressive<00:00:56.579> design<00:00:57.090> with
