the other essential tool for bead making

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.320 
the other essential tool for bead making
is<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> kiln<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.920> as<00:00:05.310> mentioned<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:06.150> earlier

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
is a kiln and as mentioned in earlier

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.860 
is a kiln and as mentioned in earlier
segments<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.440> kiln<00:00:07.680> performs<00:00:08.280> two<00:00:08.519> functions

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
segments the kiln performs two functions

it<00:00:09.870> allows<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.769> bead<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.190> cool<00:00:11.429> off<00:00:11.700> very

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
it allows the bead to cool off very

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.690 
it allows the bead to cool off very
gently<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.380> avoid<00:00:13.530> thermal<00:00:14.219> shock

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700

temperature I want in this case right

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.520 
temperature I want in this case right
now<00:03:03.000> I've<00:03:03.240> got<00:03:03.450> my<00:03:03.480> pyrometer<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.410> it's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
now I've got my pyrometer and it's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.470 
now I've got my pyrometer and it's
indicating<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.610> hard<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.940> see<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.270> course

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
indicating it's hard to see of course

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.380 
indicating it's hard to see of course
but<00:03:06.810> take<00:03:07.080> my<00:03:07.260> word<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.710> that's<00:03:07.920> about<00:03:08.390> 950

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
but take my word for it that's about 950

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.830 
but take my word for it that's about 950
975<00:03:10.400> Fahrenheit<00:03:11.400> thousand<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:12.330> straight<00:03:12.660> up

on<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.290> middle<00:03:13.530> slash<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.060> that's<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
on that middle slash so that's the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.410 
on that middle slash so that's the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
goes into the kiln it does not risk

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.210 
goes into the kiln it does not risk
getting<00:03:41.910> into<00:03:42.720> contact<00:03:43.350> with<00:03:43.440> electrodes

steel mandrel into this top area because

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.830 
steel mandrel into this top area because
it<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.070> electrocute<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.970> by<00:04:00.239> touching<00:04:00.510> the
