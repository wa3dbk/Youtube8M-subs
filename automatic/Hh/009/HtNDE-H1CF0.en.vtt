00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and this is only my opinion I think it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.760 
and this is only my opinion I think it
looks<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.240> dated<00:01:48.780> now<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.320> looks<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
looks a little bit dated now it looks a
little<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.460> old-fashioned<00:01:51.299> Oh

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
little bit old-fashioned Oh

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179

so getting the letters rolling in from

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
so getting the letters rolling in from
the<00:01:53.280> Ducati<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.820> that's<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.359> I<00:01:54.390> think

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the Ducati on that's what I think

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and I don't like to say it really but a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.369 
and I don't like to say it really but a
little<00:02:07.710> bit<00:02:07.970> 1980s<00:02:08.970> probably<00:02:09.750> upset<00:02:10.019> loads<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
people already but you see for some

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.610 
people already but you see for some
people<00:02:12.239> that's<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.780> problem<00:02:13.019> because

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
people that's not a problem because

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.280 
people that's not a problem because
they're<00:02:13.860> more<00:02:14.010> interested<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:14.610> happens

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
they're more interested in what happens

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.199

down<00:02:15.439> there<00:02:15.709> with<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.159> motor<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.670> what<00:02:17.060> it's

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
down there with the motor and what it's

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.990 
down there with the motor and what it's

who<00:02:20.120> ride<00:02:20.420> twins<00:02:20.870> often<00:02:21.140> say<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> they<00:02:21.829> do<00:02:21.980> it

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
who ride twins often say that they do it

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.789 
who ride twins often say that they do it
because<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.670> bikes<00:02:22.879> have<00:02:23.150> character<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.989> still

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
because the bikes have character I still

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.619 
because the bikes have character I still
hold<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.159> view<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.519> character<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.209> another

hold the view that character is another

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.899 
hold the view that character is another
word<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.049> vibration<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:28.219> that's<00:02:28.579> what

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
word for vibration because that's what

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.289 
word for vibration because that's what
they<00:02:29.090> do

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299

let's<00:05:17.839> talk<00:05:18.169> first<00:05:18.349> about<00:05:18.529> this<00:05:18.830> Ducati<00:05:19.249> I've

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
let's talk first about this Ducati I've

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.489 
let's talk first about this Ducati I've
made<00:05:20.179> no<00:05:20.330> secret<00:05:20.539> of<00:05:20.749> it<00:05:20.809> in<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.110> past<00:05:21.289> that

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
made no secret of it in the past that

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.259 
made no secret of it in the past that
I'm<00:05:21.589> not<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.860> great<00:05:22.189> big<00:05:22.369> fan<00:05:22.580> of<00:05:22.610> twins<00:05:22.969> I<00:05:23.089> think

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:23.269 
I'm not a great big fan of twins I think

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:25.179 
I'm not a great big fan of twins I think
it's<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.509> case<00:05:23.659> of<00:05:23.689> how<00:05:24.349> you<00:05:24.409> get<00:05:24.619> brought<00:05:24.889> what

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
it's a case of how you get brought what

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.100 
it's a case of how you get brought what
you<00:05:25.279> get<00:05:25.429> used<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.759> over<00:05:26.089> the<00:05:26.179> years<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.809> riding

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
ST is the bike that surprised me the

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.100

most<00:06:16.069> out<00:06:16.429> of<00:06:16.459> these<00:06:16.699> three<00:06:17.029> I've<00:06:17.629> never<00:06:17.929> been

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
most out of these three I've never been

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.839 
most out of these three I've never been
a<00:06:18.229> great<00:06:18.559> big<00:06:18.769> fan<00:06:18.949> of<00:06:18.979> transit<00:06:19.459> in<00:06:19.519> the<00:06:19.579> past

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
a great big fan of transit in the past

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.339 
a great big fan of transit in the past
I've<00:06:19.999> always<00:06:20.300> thought<00:06:20.509> they're<00:06:20.689> a<00:06:20.809> little<00:06:21.169> bit

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
I've always thought they're a little bit

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.350 
I've always thought they're a little bit
agricultural<00:06:22.279> and<00:06:22.459> I've<00:06:22.819> always<00:06:23.149> thought

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
agricultural and I've always thought

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.389 
agricultural and I've always thought
that<00:06:23.419> their<00:06:23.659> triple<00:06:23.959> cylinder<00:06:24.409> motors<00:06:24.769> was

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:25.399 
that their triple cylinder motors was

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.459 
that their triple cylinder motors was
perhaps<00:06:25.579> slightly<00:06:26.149> closer<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.629> a<00:06:26.659> twin<00:06:27.050> than

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
perhaps slightly closer to a twin than

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.769 
perhaps slightly closer to a twin than
it<00:06:27.589> was<00:06:27.740> to<00:06:27.949> a<00:06:27.979> four<00:06:28.339> but<00:06:28.999> I<00:06:29.059> have<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.389> say<00:06:29.569> on

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.439 
it was to a four but I have to say on
this<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:31.009> surprised<00:06:31.490> me<00:06:31.669> I<00:06:31.729> think<00:06:32.029> it's<00:06:32.179> closer

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
this it surprised me I think it's closer

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.569 
this it surprised me I think it's closer
to<00:06:32.629> a<00:06:32.809> four<00:06:33.169> than<00:06:33.379> it<00:06:33.469> is<00:06:33.559> a<00:06:33.589> twin<00:06:33.919> it<00:06:34.039> really<00:06:34.490> is
