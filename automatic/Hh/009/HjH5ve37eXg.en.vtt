00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
can probably tie it pretty tight to a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
can probably tie it pretty tight to a
steak<00:00:42.329> now<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.410> cast<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:44.480> I'm<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> get

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
steak now to cast this I'm going to get

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.060 
steak now to cast this I'm going to get
up<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> line<00:00:47.370> unfurled<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.190 

I'm<00:00:55.610> fishing<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.120> overflow<00:00:56.600> canal<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.140> I

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
I'm fishing the overflow canal so I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.890 
I'm fishing the overflow canal so I
don't<00:00:57.380> need<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.820> really<00:00:58.820> far<00:00:59.090> cast<00:00:59.540> because

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
don't need a really far cast because

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.350 
don't need a really far cast because
this<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.290> not<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.500> really<00:01:00.829> big<00:01:00.860> canal<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.239> what

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
this is not a really big canal so what

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
I'm going to do let me get this swing in

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.140 
I'm going to do let me get this swing in
a<00:01:05.420> little<00:01:05.660> bit<00:01:05.810> I'm<00:01:06.050> pointing<00:01:06.979> my<00:01:07.010> stake<00:01:07.520> at

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
a little bit I'm pointing my stake at

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.620 
a little bit I'm pointing my stake at
the<00:01:08.420> water<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:11.090> here<00:01:11.990> we<00:01:12.080> go<00:01:12.610> whoa<00:01:13.630> that

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the water and here we go whoa that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.349 
the water and here we go whoa that
didn't<00:01:14.810> work<00:01:14.960> out<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.170> well

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.760 

works<00:01:22.359> better<00:01:22.600> off<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.869> broomstick<00:01:23.259> but<00:01:23.740> I

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
works better off a broomstick but I

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.609 
works better off a broomstick but I
didn't<00:01:24.039> have<00:01:24.130> any<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> here's<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> second<00:01:26.710> try

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
didn't have any so here's the second try

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.270 
didn't have any so here's the second try
much<00:01:29.619> better<00:01:29.950> if<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.880> think<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:31.179> wanted<00:01:31.509> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
much better if you think I wanted it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.980 
much better if you think I wanted it
this<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.460> reality<00:01:33.789> fishing<00:01:34.450> people<00:01:34.689> it

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
this is reality fishing people it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.760 
this is reality fishing people it
doesn't<00:01:35.380> always<00:01:35.619> work<00:01:35.859> out<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.310> first<00:01:36.490> time

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
doesn't always work out the first time

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
doesn't always work out the first time
so<00:01:38.770> what<00:01:38.950> I'm<00:01:39.069> going<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.250> do<00:01:39.429> here

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.569 

I'm<00:01:43.329> not<00:01:43.539> going<00:01:43.719> to<00:01:43.780> fish<00:01:43.959> a<00:01:43.990> tight<00:01:44.319> line<00:01:44.590> I'm

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
I'm not going to fish a tight line I'm

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.240 
I'm not going to fish a tight line I'm
going<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:45.880> put<00:01:46.060> some<00:01:46.209> slack<00:01:46.509> in<00:01:46.689> the<00:01:46.780> line<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
going to put some slack in the line and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.770 
going to put some slack in the line and
then<00:01:48.969> I'm<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:50.939> press<00:01:51.939> that<00:01:51.969> down<00:01:52.209> this

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
then I'm going to press that down this

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.199 
then I'm going to press that down this
is<00:01:52.989> a<00:01:53.020> three-foot<00:01:53.679> stake<00:01:56.939> kind<00:01:57.939> of<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.179> a

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
is a three-foot stake kind of at a

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:04.149 
is a three-foot stake kind of at a
slight<00:01:58.599> angle<00:01:58.840> away<00:01:59.200> from<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.739> water

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.190 

and<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.149> bite<00:02:05.479> when<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.810> come<00:02:06.049> by<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and when I have a bite when I come by to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.719 
and when I have a bite when I come by to
check<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.799> there's<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.039> fish<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:07.579> the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
check it if there's a fish on there the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.199 
check it if there's a fish on there the
line<00:02:07.969> should<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.330> tight<00:02:08.770> now<00:02:09.770> I've<00:02:09.920> got<00:02:10.209> five

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
line should be tight now I've got five

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.040 
line should be tight now I've got five
more<00:02:11.480> genes<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.959> do<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.370> should<00:02:13.550> pay<00:02:13.730> off

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
more genes to do so this should pay off

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.449 
more genes to do so this should pay off
when<00:02:15.050> you're<00:02:15.200> subsistence<00:02:15.860> fishing<00:02:16.040> like<00:02:16.280> we

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
when you're subsistence fishing like we

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.240 
when you're subsistence fishing like we
are<00:02:16.610> today<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:18.380> want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> maximize<00:02:19.220> your

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
are today you want to maximize your

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.070 
are today you want to maximize your
potential<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.090> running<00:02:20.360> some<00:02:20.540> lines<00:02:20.780> for

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
potential and running some lines for

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.740 
potential and running some lines for
catfish<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.739> legal<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.790> most<00:02:22.940> places<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.660> you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
catfish is legal in most places and you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.550 
catfish is legal in most places and you
check<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.349> before<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.830> go<00:02:25.489> do<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.760> and
