00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
don't use the same process but it's a

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
don't use the same process but it's a

you know black finished steel slide and
but<00:02:03.690> here's<00:02:03.899> here's<00:02:04.229> where<00:02:04.380> some<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
but here's here's where some of the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.790 
but here's here's where some of the
similarities<00:02:05.789> end<00:02:06.259> well<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.289> should<00:02:07.560> say<00:02:07.770> it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
similarities end well I should say it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.830 
similarities end well I should say it
before<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.360> trigger<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
before I do that is the trigger is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
before I do that is the trigger is
essentially<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> complete<00:02:11.009> knockoff<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
essentially a complete knockoff of the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
essentially a complete knockoff of the
Glock<00:02:12.000> trigger<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.840> little

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
Glock trigger they got that little

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.990 
Glock trigger they got that little
safety<00:02:13.620> catch<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> inside<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.790> have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
safety catch on the inside that you have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.540 
safety catch on the inside that you have
to<00:02:15.090> actuate<00:02:15.480> before<00:02:15.900> before<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.130> trigger

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
to actuate before before the trigger

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.729 
to actuate before before the trigger
will<00:02:18.270> work<00:02:18.480> which<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.020> personally<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
will work which I personally think is

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.360 
will work which I personally think is
ridiculous<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.870> mean<00:02:22.370> obviously

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
ridiculous because it I mean obviously

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.370 
ridiculous because it I mean obviously
if<00:02:23.700> your<00:02:23.790> fingers<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.209> there<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:25.230> gonna

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
if your fingers in there it's gonna

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.479 
if your fingers in there it's gonna
you're<00:02:25.800> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> pull<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.160> trigger<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
you're going to pull the trigger a

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.000 
you're going to pull the trigger a
either<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.050> I've<00:02:28.319> already<00:02:28.590> stated

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
either way so and I've already stated

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.229 
either way so and I've already stated
this<00:02:29.130> before<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.489> think<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> Glock<00:02:29.970> trigger

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
this before I think the Glock trigger

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.720 
this before I think the Glock trigger
designs<00:02:30.390> stupid<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.170> well<00:02:31.319> but<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.610> know

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
designs stupid as well but so you know

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
designs stupid as well but so you know
when<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.209> go<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.510> copy<00:02:33.690> someone's<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
when you go and copy someone's on a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.570 
when you go and copy someone's on a
stupid<00:02:34.650> design<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.069> doesn't<00:02:35.280> make<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.400> better

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
stupid design it doesn't make it better

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
stupid design it doesn't make it better
it<00:02:35.819> still<00:02:36.030> still<00:02:36.630> makes<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.930> stupid<00:02:37.319> another

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
it still still makes it stupid another

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.100 
it still still makes it stupid another
thing<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.150> XD<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
thing that I really don't like it XD the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.410 
thing that I really don't like it XD the
XD<00:02:40.440> guys<00:02:40.620> did<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.069> they<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:42.060> grip

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
XD guys did was they put this grip

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.309 
XD guys did was they put this grip
safety<00:02:42.629> on<00:02:42.930> here

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
safety on here

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.470 
safety on here
now<00:02:44.099> obviously<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.519> grip<00:02:44.700> safety<00:02:44.909> dates<00:02:45.299> back

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
now obviously the grip safety dates back

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.080 
now obviously the grip safety dates back
to<00:02:45.719> the<00:02:45.840> design<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.439> the<00:02:46.560> 1911

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to the design of the 1911

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970 
to the design of the 1911
with<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.660> 1911<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.290> made<00:02:49.440> sense<00:02:49.739> because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
with on the 1911 it made sense because

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
with on the 1911 it made sense because
you<00:02:50.280> carry<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.670> gun<00:02:50.940> cocked<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> locked

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
you carry that gun cocked and locked

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.199 
you carry that gun cocked and locked
with<00:02:52.319> typically<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> four<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> five<00:02:53.280> four<00:02:53.760> four

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
with typically a four to five four four

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.670 
with typically a four to five four four
pound<00:02:54.480> trigger<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.349> know<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
pound trigger and so so you know so it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
pound trigger and so so you know so it
makes<00:02:58.920> sense<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.580> additional

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
makes sense to have that additional

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180 
makes sense to have that additional
safety<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:01.319> no<00:03:01.530> reason<00:03:01.560> why<00:03:01.950> you'd

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
safety but I see no reason why you'd

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.100 
safety but I see no reason why you'd
have<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.550> additional<00:03:03.360> grip<00:03:03.569> safety<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
have a additional grip safety on a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.140 
have a additional grip safety on a
double<00:03:04.440> action<00:03:04.739> only<00:03:04.860> pistol<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.060> just

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
double action only pistol so it's just

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.759 
double action only pistol so it's just
another<00:03:06.420> thief<00:03:06.720> I've<00:03:06.930> got<00:03:07.170> about<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> gun

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
another thief I've got about this gun

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.890 
another thief I've got about this gun
one<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.849> things<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.150> few<00:03:09.360> things<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:09.870> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
one of the things a few things I like a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.479 
one of the things a few things I like a
lot<00:03:10.170> about<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.470> kind<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.980> grip<00:03:11.280> is

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
lot about the kind of that the grip is

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.790 
lot about the kind of that the grip is
much<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:11.880> ergonomic<00:03:12.510> than<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> Glock<00:03:13.290> and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
much more ergonomic than a Glock and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.009 
much more ergonomic than a Glock and
when<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.950> say<00:03:14.180> Jurgen<00:03:15.180> AMA<00:03:15.330> closely<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.840> just

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
when I say Jurgen AMA closely I just

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.979 
when I say Jurgen AMA closely I just
mean<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.319> smaller<00:03:17.599> comparatively<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
mean it's smaller comparatively the you

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.170 
mean it's smaller comparatively the you
know<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.200> grip<00:03:19.410> Glocks<00:03:19.739> or<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.580> Glock<00:03:20.790> grips

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
know the grip Glocks or the Glock grips

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
know the grip Glocks or the Glock grips
are<00:03:21.450> are<00:03:21.810> much<00:03:22.110> larger<00:03:22.350> than<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.860> XD<00:03:23.190> so

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
are are much larger than the XD so

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.059 
are are much larger than the XD so
that's<00:03:23.610> good<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.709> what<00:03:25.709> else

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
that's good and what else

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.460 
that's good and what else
accessory<00:03:26.519> rail<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.940> nice<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.989> sights<00:03:28.230> on

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
but still it just doesn't make sense to

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
rounds of 45 no matter what you do

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.310 
rounds of 45 no matter what you do
that's<00:06:24.610> that's<00:06:25.360> just<00:06:25.570> not<00:06:25.719> going<00:06:25.840> to<00:06:25.900> all<00:06:26.139> that

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.709 
that's that's just not going to all that
compact<00:06:26.800> so<00:06:27.460> it<00:06:27.550> is<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.699> pretty<00:06:27.909> big<00:06:28.030> gun

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
compact so it is a pretty big gun

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.930 
compact so it is a pretty big gun
certainly<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:29.830> it's<00:06:30.159> it's<00:06:30.699> small<00:06:30.789> enough

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
actually a 13 rounder that obviously you

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.640 
actually a 13 rounder that obviously you
can<00:06:52.210> see<00:06:52.330> the<00:06:52.449> way<00:06:52.539> they<00:06:52.659> do<00:06:52.750> that<00:06:52.990> is<00:06:53.050> they

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
can see the way they do that is they

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.990 
can see the way they do that is they
hang<00:06:53.800> a<00:06:53.889> big<00:06:54.039> hunk<00:06:54.250> of<00:06:54.310> plastic<00:06:54.430> off<00:06:54.849> the

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:56.469 
bottom some people like this some people

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:59.189 
bottom some people like this some people
don't<00:06:56.889> I<00:06:57.099> personally<00:06:58.060> would<00:06:58.659> prefer<00:06:58.690> to<00:06:58.990> have

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
don't I personally would prefer to have

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.830 
don't I personally would prefer to have
a<00:06:59.259> smaller<00:06:59.940> backup<00:07:00.940> magazine<00:07:01.360> just<00:07:01.539> because

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
a smaller backup magazine just because

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.749 
a smaller backup magazine just because
it'll<00:07:02.020> easier<00:07:02.320> to<00:07:02.440> conceal<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:03.520> extra

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 
it'll easier to conceal and the extra

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.520 
it'll easier to conceal and the extra
three<00:07:03.940> rounds<00:07:04.360> well<00:07:04.539> I<00:07:04.840> guess<00:07:05.139> you<00:07:05.320> know<00:07:05.440> I'll

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
three rounds well I guess you know I'll

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.180 
three rounds well I guess you know I'll
have<00:07:05.680> to<00:07:05.830> make

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
have to make

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.650 
have to make
without<00:07:06.370> them<00:07:06.640> other<00:07:06.850> people<00:07:07.060> to<00:07:07.390> them<00:07:07.510> it

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
without them other people to them it

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.880 
without them other people to them it
makes<00:07:07.780> more<00:07:07.990> sense<00:07:08.050> to<00:07:08.440> have<00:07:08.560> a<00:07:08.620> backup

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
makes more sense to have a backup

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.590 
makes more sense to have a backup
magazine<00:07:09.370> that<00:07:09.490> has<00:07:09.610> more<00:07:09.790> rounds<00:07:10.090> that's

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
magazine that has more rounds that's

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.800 
magazine that has more rounds that's
kind<00:07:10.840> of<00:07:10.900> to<00:07:11.170> each<00:07:11.290> his<00:07:11.410> own<00:07:11.620> so<00:07:11.970> I<00:07:12.970> guess<00:07:13.390> folks

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
kind of to each his own so I guess folks

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.990 
kind of to each his own so I guess folks
that's<00:07:14.110> that's<00:07:14.590> pretty<00:07:14.800> much<00:07:14.920> it<00:07:15.340> on<00:07:15.370> the<00:07:15.610> XP

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000
