and<00:00:00.120> it's<00:00:00.299> going<00:00:00.480> to<00:00:00.599> form<00:00:00.840> carbon<00:00:01.199> which<00:00:01.949> is

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
and it's going to form carbon which is

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.889 
and it's going to form carbon which is
in<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.370> platform<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.179> it's<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.689> rise

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
in the platform and it's going to rise

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.960 
in the platform and it's going to rise
it's<00:00:04.319> like<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> Oscar<00:00:05.040> Meyer<00:00:05.250> Weiner<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.850> your

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
it's like the Oscar Meyer Weiner in your

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.970 
it's like the Oscar Meyer Weiner in your
ear<00:00:06.150> right<00:00:06.569> doesn't<00:00:07.259> go<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.529> high<00:00:07.710> better

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
ear right doesn't go that high better

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
ear right doesn't go that high better
quality<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.490> there

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.010 

Holyfield<00:00:31.810> Holyfield<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:34.149> it<00:00:34.360> takes<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.750> few

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
Holyfield Holyfield know it takes a few

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.340 
Holyfield Holyfield know it takes a few
minutes<00:00:35.219> observe<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.550> physical<00:00:37.449> change<00:00:37.719> it's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
minutes observe the physical change it's

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.290 
minutes observe the physical change it's
going<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.680> change<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:39.129> color<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:40.120> then

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
going to change in color and then

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.000 
going to change in color and then
chemically<00:00:40.629> you're<00:00:41.140> going<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.379> see<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.710> steam

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
chemically you're going to see the steam

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.479 
chemically you're going to see the steam
coming<00:00:42.250> out<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:43.260> highly<00:00:44.260> exothermic<00:00:44.649> so<00:00:45.280> this

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
coming out and highly exothermic so this

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.920 
coming out and highly exothermic so this
is<00:00:45.640> something<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:46.120> shouldn't<00:00:46.360> do<00:00:46.629> at<00:00:46.809> your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
is something you shouldn't do at your

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.740 
is something you shouldn't do at your
house<00:00:47.610> well<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:48.790> you<00:00:48.909> have<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.360> at<00:00:49.600> your

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
house well then you have this at your

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:16.720 
house well then you have this at your
house

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730

Oh

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:55.940 

it's<00:02:03.200> slowing<00:02:03.680> around

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.590 

it's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.700> cleaner<00:02:56.940> goes<00:02:57.209> yeah
