00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.210
 Hello dear visitor of ours 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.080
 garden world site 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.150
 we stand in front of such wonderful 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.500
 Asters very many their love 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.660
 grown specifically on September 1 and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 generally sharp very long bloom and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.610
 decorate the garden but unfortunately they have 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.810
 unpleasant 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.510
 one feature is that all of a sudden they 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.649
 start to fade and see with 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.010
 buds together and sometimes it is so 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.819
 a massive phenomenon takes that here's the whole 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.640
 this 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:49.269
 little bed she is literally for 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.089
 a few days may all perish 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.949
 let's discuss with you now from what are you 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.289
 happens and how to prevent this from 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.879
 blame for this as always again 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.239
 fungal diseases 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.049
 we have a lot of them in all cultures and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.539
 so you can be prepared to 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.729
 time to take action on hand always 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.820
 there must be some fungicides to 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.299
 process our plants here look 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 at least there are good flowers here 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.810
 but with this here the plants have already happened 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.310
 trouble started here like this 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 here 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.939
 rotting to see the bud that started 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.719
 it was blooming and it can not all 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.140
 dries up 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:41.649
 And here here is absolutely already withered 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 plants I specifically left it for 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:51.039
 order to show the development process 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 diseases here are the so -called fusarium 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.810
 and withering 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.159
 suffer and I only asters but in 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.909
 this year and 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.469
 individuals and not very serious at many 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.939
 suffered so it was practically 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.200
 almost all the plants pulled out 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.280
 diseases it spreads through 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 the soil 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.140
 therefore extremely important for asters 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.390
 change and for value including change 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.180
 in no case 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.560
 here on this place next year their not 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.190
 plant what to do with these 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.790
 plants just like that pull them out 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 from the ground do not need to dig them with 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.890
 a lump of earth and this whole place 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 I don't have a dog right now 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 look here he see completely 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.299
 she completely rotted roots, and he and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.940
 no, she shrank, why not further 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.200
 this disease began to spread i 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.730
 I admit that I have already processed spilled 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.310
 fungicide here in till in this case 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.099
 the foundation is why here are the neighboring plant 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 seems to be left alive with me and this 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.150
 the place where you dug this plant 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 be sure to sell shed mortar 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.230
 fungicide foundazol here in this case 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.930
 my foundation is dissolved if you have 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.760
 you already have this disease 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.250
 so harmful and that it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.700
 spreads and dong long in the soil 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.170
 these pathogens persist 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.870
 if you already have all the soil literally 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.420
 infected wherever you try 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.310
 plant everywhere they start a hybrid 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.799
 what to do in this case if 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.760
 after all, you love your lines here 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.620
 There is such a method of heat treatment 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.840
 soil 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.209
 when here are some sources even 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.450
 write spill why kerosene and 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.660
 set it on fire specially 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.989
 and you can and donâ€™t take action 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.230
 Here, for example, I plant my astra where I am 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.599
 I burn a pile or spring special garbage 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.609
 Now I bring that garbage plant 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.790
 the rest of the place where I plan 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.489
 next year to plant asters harness 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.380
 this garbage in the spring again bring the same 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.320
 this garbage is good 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.570
 roasted and now on this place 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.349
 you can plant asters and that's how practice 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.710
 shows 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.750
 they get less sick 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.729
 Our neighbors have suffered more 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.340
 asters from this disease 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.490
 appreciate, too, I already said that a lot 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.789
 suffered so here is the measure she 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.819
 justifies itself ie after the fire 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.789
 you plant your asters and if you get sick 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:46.190
 Of course, don't expect her to be here. 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.669
 Now you will cut this bud and continue to 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.650
 you and the line will continue to develop no she 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.949
 here is how practice shows the plant 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.380
 starts to shrink and it disappears and 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.960
 dies completely and still through the soil and 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.919
 infects other plants that's why not 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.889
 regret and 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.919
 dig it out and along with a piece 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.830
 Soil carry somewhere in the fire in a barrel 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.570
 where do you live all plant residues 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.759
 sick and again spill watch 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.960
 cancel the plant spill in children 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:23.599
 put here if you take such measures 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.050
 spraying fungicides and changing places 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.509
 planting on hot soil after castration 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.360
 sense not on hot soil but i'm after 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.210
 plant fires then you will 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.960
 beautiful and good will be keenly pleased 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.960
 you all fall
