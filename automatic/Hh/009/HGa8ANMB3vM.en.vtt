00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.920
 I leave here I was down and well let's 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.990
 cook well to prepare this salad 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.470
 of rifle and the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.910
 is to boil to cook our 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.640
 pasta 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.200
 when our water is already boiling what 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 what we are going to do is put salt 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.730
 and add the pasta and here we are going to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.250
 leave for approximately 12 minutes 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 according to what the instructions of 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.789
 your package 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.500
 while the pasta is sewn I will go 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 splitting and chopping others 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.620
 ingredients the purple onion the good 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.630
 Cutting in pens can also be 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.299
 white onion without any problem 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.600
 then I'm going to cut the tomatoes 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.390
 cherries in rooms if they do not find 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.299
 these cherry tomatoes or do not want 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.850
 buy tomato can use the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.719
 normal of the ball salting of which 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.719
 you prefer 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.490
 I'm going to split the black olive and if not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.360
 they like you can skip the is the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.360
 cut in three parts 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
 then let's cut our lettuce 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520
 can be the lettuce that you want 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 in this case I will use lettuces 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.770
 orejona and we are going to cut it into boxes 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.890
 small ones that are easy to grasp and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 taste with a fork for example this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.970
 which it is larger what we do 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.970
 is to break it in half 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:14.370
 and now if I break it into pictures 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 and so with all our lettuce 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.170
 since our vegetables ready what 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's do now is cut panela in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920
 squares 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.390
 already with the ingredients cut we 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.680
 we go to the stove to see how the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.700
 pasta after 12 minutes uncover 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.239
 we tried the pasta we rectified that already 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.370
 it's al dente so we put out the fire 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.370
 and we 're going to take the pasta 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.670
 drain them 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.080
 and we will put waterjet 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 quickly nothing more to stop the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.220
 cooking we passed the pasta to a bowl and 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.220
 they were ready to put together our 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.260
 salad with a rifle and to assemble 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.050
 salad is going to be very simple but 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.770
 we put a box of lettuce 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.820
 then we put our pasta 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.840
 then we will put the purple onion 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.250
 already filleted 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.250
 the black olive 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.280
 the cherry tomatoes 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.630
 panela 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.290
 then I will put basil leaves 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.290
 that we 're going to cut like this with our fingers 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.450
 almost finally I'm going to put almonds 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.450
 filleted 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.079
 last last week that I uploaded the 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.359
 video of the chimichurri they asked me 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.659
 in that they could use it and well in 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:16.560
 this installed is a very good way of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.979
 use the chimichurri so we're going 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.979
 to put 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.350
 murcia chimichurri 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.930
 let's mix all the ingredients 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.930
 of our salad 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.509
 and we have the salad ready to 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.080
 Plating the plated is going to be 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.920
 simpler we simply take our 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.650
 salad 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.920
 and we will accommodate it in our 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.760
 plate 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.910
 taking care not to dirty the edges and there 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.300
 make sure that you have all the 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.610
 elements is to say that it has panela that 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.270
 have cherries that have onion that 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.740
 have olive obviously pasta and 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.440
 lettuce 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.509
 so we have our rifle salad 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.699
