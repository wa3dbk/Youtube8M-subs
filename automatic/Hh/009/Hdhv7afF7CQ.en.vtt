00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
know we did desperately need a

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.290 
know we did desperately need a
centre-back<00:00:50.890> because<00:00:51.370> our<00:00:51.550> defense<00:00:51.850> was<00:00:52.030> just

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
centre-back because our defense was just

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.689 
centre-back because our defense was just
absolutely<00:00:52.780> shocking<00:00:53.199> i<00:00:53.500> was<00:00:53.920> conceding<00:00:54.399> so

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
absolutely shocking i was conceding so

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.040 
absolutely shocking i was conceding so
many<00:00:54.940> goals<00:00:55.120> in<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.480> last<00:00:55.600> couple<00:00:55.870> episodes

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
many goals in the last couple episodes

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.680 
many goals in the last couple episodes
so<00:00:56.949> hopefully<00:00:57.160> pepper<00:00:57.609> will<00:00:58.000> shore<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:58.420> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
so hopefully pepper will shore up the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.450 
so hopefully pepper will shore up the
defense<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.199> i<00:00:59.320> decided<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.769> go<00:00:59.800> for<00:01:00.070> veron

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
defense and i decided to go for veron

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.819 
defense and i decided to go for veron
instead<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.269> Albiol<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.989> at<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.649> other

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
instead of Albiol in at the other

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.469 
instead of Albiol in at the other
centre-back<00:01:03.309> position<00:01:03.730> mainly<00:01:04.030> for<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.210> fact

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
centre-back position mainly for the fact

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.030 
centre-back position mainly for the fact
that<00:01:04.570> he<00:01:04.720> just<00:01:04.930> says<00:01:05.049> better<00:01:05.290> paste<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.890> i'll

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
