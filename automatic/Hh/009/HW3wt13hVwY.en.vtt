helped<00:01:29.579> build<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.720> will

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
helped build back a little bit i will

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
helped build back a little bit i will
say<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:31.860> definitely<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.549> he

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
say that but i definitely think when he

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
say that but i definitely think when he
is<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.970> top<00:01:33.150> by<00:01:33.360> himself<00:01:33.689> he's<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.200> an

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is up top by himself he's just an

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
is up top by himself he's just an
absolute<00:01:34.770> force<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.369> reckoned<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
absolute force to be reckoned with and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
absolute force to be reckoned with and
he<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> juggernaut<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.530> two<00:01:37.890> point

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
he is just a juggernaut so two point

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.340 
he is just a juggernaut so two point
three<00:01:38.189> nine<00:01:38.369> seven<00:01:38.790> million<00:01:39.450> coins<00:01:39.960> guys<00:01:40.140> is

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.809 
video right here is that that sometimes
he<00:02:41.709> kind<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.920> disappeared<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.459> didn't<00:02:42.670> see

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
he kind of disappeared I didn't see

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.490 
he kind of disappeared I didn't see
where<00:02:43.090> he<00:02:43.150> went<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.720> mean<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.080> think<00:02:44.110> that's

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
where he went I mean I think that's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.559 
where he went I mean I think that's
mainly<00:02:44.709> due<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.160> medium<00:02:45.579> defensive<00:02:46.390> work

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
mainly due to that medium defensive work

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.390 
mainly due to that medium defensive work

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
interesting because he does come as a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.479

me one of the big reasons why I think
that<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.570> though<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.870> because<00:04:37.900> he<00:04:38.290> came<00:04:38.470> as<00:04:38.680> a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
that is though is because he came as a

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.590 
that is though is because he came as a
cam<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.430> people<00:04:39.700> can<00:04:39.910> convert<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.360> striker

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
rather than get an in-form as a left mid

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.670 
rather than get an in-form as a left mid
or<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> left-wing<00:04:43.510> sup<00:04:43.750> Billy<00:04:44.110> was<00:04:44.350> my<00:04:44.470> thoughts
