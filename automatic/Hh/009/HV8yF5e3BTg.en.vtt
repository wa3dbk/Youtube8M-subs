00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
able to get away with using it as a

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.809 
able to get away with using it as a

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
high in the hips so I don't think it's

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.199 
high in the hips so I don't think it's
the<00:01:47.439> most<00:01:47.560> comfortable<00:01:48.039> thing<00:01:48.219> to<00:01:48.249> do<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:49.149> is

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
the most comfortable thing to do this is

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.089 
the most comfortable thing to do this is
a<00:01:49.359> larger<00:01:49.689> satchel<00:01:50.109> but<00:01:50.349> not<00:01:50.529> overly<00:01:50.829> large

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
a larger satchel but not overly large

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.550 
a larger satchel but not overly large
I'm<00:01:51.549> only<00:01:51.789> 5/3<00:01:52.389> so<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.689> looks<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.959> bit<00:01:52.990> oversized

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
I'm only 5/3 so it looks a bit oversized

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.620 
I'm only 5/3 so it looks a bit oversized
on<00:01:53.799> me<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.429> would<00:01:54.609> be<00:01:54.700> heels<00:01:54.969> only<00:01:55.329> kind<00:01:55.569> of

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
on me this would be heels only kind of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.359 
on me this would be heels only kind of
bag<00:01:55.779> for<00:01:56.079> me<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.409> think<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.069> would<00:01:57.219> make<00:01:57.249> a

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369
