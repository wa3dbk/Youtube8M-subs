 his nickname forces her without the show 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 aside from this yellow decidedly very much to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.830
 the fashion right now in germany 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 m3 is more of a discreet style than

 shield opening the pay the price of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.029
 cooling for retro brakes

 tapered back way puller wheels 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.150
 of 17 inches roadways in michelin m 2 x 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.420
 3 the n 3 looks like nothing but it's 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 a fury of performance 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.570
 outstanding signed bmw motorsport you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 the 1000m start stopped in 25 8 is a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 one tenth more than the honda nsx 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.250
 but seven tenths better than the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 ferrari 348 voluntarily restrained to 250 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 kilometers hour this purebred is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 powered by a 6 cylinder 3 liter 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 with a 24-valve cylinder head 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.129
 an absolute success jacques and especially 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 a remarkable docility and yet 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 you had made him see all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 the colors there you know we see 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 that it's a car always add 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 a lot more done to ride on a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 track and on the road also from elsewhere 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.719
 but she is much more manageable 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 much more agile and I feasted 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.409
 that this car n 3 the 6 cylinder in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.030
 done there is everything you need for 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 have fun on a track the car is 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.650
 enough power for 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.170
 acceleration 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 I enjoy it and you claim that if we 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.290
 had dropped the crate a little bit 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 the more they were even more successful 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.110
 we are obviously the m3 I have 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 drives a car in the same kind 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.740
 in any case the old on the slopes in 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 Germany and the car was lowered 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.159
 of course we would win a lot 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.380
 maneuverability braking antunes doubt 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.400
 but already here the car is a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.990
 car we can go roll on the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.540
 track I really got really 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.080
 amused with the car 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.490
 at miramas the suspensions good at 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.630
 expansion is always the same thing 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.220
 it is a suspension a little flexible and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.240
 to turn on the track but that's 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.070
 true that look we see well the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.900
 work suspensions on a line 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.510
 right and we see that the car had 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.740
 suspended acceleration acceleration 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.150
 phenomenal formidable light cars 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.590
 the staging of the perfect box very 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.660
 very handy very easy to handle and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.680
 fast braking ba braking I 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.560
 looked at her she does not see at all the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 car she and she is light and the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040
 place pretty drily and violently because 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.820
 that all the same the cars of 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.190
 road tend to be slightly 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.130
 under tack for security but 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 look at that you would have wished a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.650
 box 6 because it's one of the big 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.820
 models 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.500
 frankly to turn on the track 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.610
 I had plenty of 5 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.810
 speeds is already used in Germany 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.980
 and because you have to change them often 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.170
 because the car goes up 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.000
 very quickly and you see it everywhere 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 where I am the trajectories on the water 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.739
 potable 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.760
 the handling the car is phenomenal 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.930
 some of our confreres have found 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.820
 that she was not incisive enough in 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.260
 strong current input on the other hand in 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.570
 released that with the power she is 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.890
 goes out but it depends I see drive 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.330
 better your colleagues but it does not prevent 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.500
 that it is true that the car the under 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.030
 but it's a question of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.680
 security is mandatory for people 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.060
 there entrusts the car anyone because 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.100
 that every voice always good that it takes 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.269
 not do anything is what will 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.560
 what can happen when we make a 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.760
 idea in comoros so we will see him again 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.430
 in slow motion what happened 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.590
 I put the car a little too much 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.850
 through you to see the skid and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.620
 with the direction that is a little bit of purpose 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.880
 is to try the car takes mercy 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.959
 she goes back to 100 m on another side I 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.770
 do not have time to control pointed 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.580
 because 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.050
 I'm used to seeing a reaction 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.460
 much more direction a single-seater and 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.290
 there I drove the car like a 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.720
 single seater and it's not a single seater 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.040
 m3 to risk what the barrel no on 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.510
 can maybe on the air at if I do not 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.850
 do not notice right now but see there 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.650
 there it goes well it goes well because 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.420
 I was an effort because it's 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.400
 jacques went back to the attacked 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.990
 it's still so beautiful but that's it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.340
 passes without problems we make mistakes 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.020
 even jacques laffite 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.230
 but do not do it on the road 1 2
