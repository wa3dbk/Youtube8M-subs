00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello to all of you guys and here we are with 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.179
 new unboxing today we're going to shell out 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 a graphics tablet for accuracy 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.099
 this was the wacom post 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.210
 graphics here and the basic version of the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.400
 stroke 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 so not within five or company 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 beautiful but the intuos liscissima la 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.699
 version without touch and therefore do not have 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 manual controls but only through 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.769
 Pen of this tablet it here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 there are three sizes in small 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.430
 medium and large this queer and small 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 there's the little one if you look in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.739
 around around 60 euros so it's not one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.739
 expense and who knows how high 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.680
 I took this graphic table here 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 because the previous one after a bit of 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 years broke pica and I wanted 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.660
 changing it did not take the same pattern 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.930
 because in the model offense therefore it is the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 bamboo also offer like this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 not for the greater the licenses of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.970
 programs and since the prizes I already had 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.979
 I took this few saved with 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 20 euros and in any case a table of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.580
 juan and of excellent quality but if this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.840
 speaking of low-cost ones 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.930
 so let's go immediately to see on 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 front page we find the logo 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.729
 of the wacom the name of the tablet 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 pretty much what the tablet is with 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.900
 creative pen and this beautiful design that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.820
 depicts the graphic table with his 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.299
 pen and some theme while in the part 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 back we find a short time the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.220
 name of a short tablet 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.040
 description of what the can do 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.060
 here below other technical details such as 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.670
 measures the weight 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.450
 the sensitivity of the company pressure 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.950
 beautiful 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 and we also find here too 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.300
 the indication that it is compatible with the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 wireless kit sold separately in the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 on the side we find the data of 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.800
 compatibility and the region 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.290
 of belonging and compatibility always 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 on windows and mac 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 on the other side simply the writing 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.910

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.470
 outside it protects the box is 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.500
 completely black 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.550
 what the buses wrote and nothing else 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.730
 behind the agcom site in the part 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.510
 low and enough data but the frog 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:02.180
 the variable opens from the outside 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:05.570

 nice writing welcome and work here yes 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:15.080
 opens again and we find here is not 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.230
 protected by these things in rubber and 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.000
 we can find creative punishment 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.920

 change in the back we find 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.319
 this cap here and in theory should 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:02.750
 be a rubber but I don't know if up 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:02.750
 this model which exists then we remove 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:11.060
 and let's pull out in here this 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.060

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.090
 if he is pressing then you are 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.170
 giving commands to the tablet four keys 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.480
 configurable on the edges and that part 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.300
 he lives on his own tablet 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.310
 surface of action indicates between 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.450

 it's not rough it did even though it can 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.510
 seem a little by the color 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.830
 it will be very smooth idrac 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.510

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.570
 there are no components like there should be 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.280
 here it opens again and which ones eventually 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.490
 for the hearing there is the battery 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:02.010
