00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
know the markets keep in mind that this
is<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.240> heavily<00:01:45.659> shorted<00:01:46.110> stock<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.040> believe<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is a heavily shorted stock I believe the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
is a heavily shorted stock I believe the
bloomberg<00:01:48.090> data<00:01:48.119> suggests<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.049> roughly<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
bloomberg data suggests that roughly a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
bloomberg data suggests that roughly a
third<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.060> blackberry<00:01:51.840> shares

third if not more a blackberry shares

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.639 
third if not more a blackberry shares
are<00:01:52.439> sold<00:01:52.470> short<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> story

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
are sold short so that's the story

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.190

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
conjunction with the touchscreen device

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.710 
conjunction with the touchscreen device
and<00:02:21.070> they<00:02:21.400> staggered<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:21.970> part<00:02:22.300> because<00:02:22.480> they

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and they staggered in part because they

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.900 
and they staggered in part because they
wanted<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.200> make<00:02:23.650> sure<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.890> people<00:02:24.190> started

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
wanted to make sure that people started

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
using the touchscreen phone first

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.840 
using the touchscreen phone first
because<00:02:26.800> they've<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.280> compete<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
because they've got to compete with the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.310 
because they've got to compete with the
likes<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.300> iphone<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.960> android

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
likes of the iphone and the android

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.550 
likes of the iphone and the android
devices<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> smaller<00:02:31.270> screen<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.530> I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
devices it is a smaller screen so I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.740 
devices it is a smaller screen so I
think<00:02:32.890> if<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:33.400> are<00:02:33.610> beefs<00:02:34.030> out<00:02:34.270> there<00:02:34.510> about

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
think if there are beefs out there about

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
think if there are beefs out there about
the<00:02:34.930> interface<00:02:35.470> those<00:02:35.890> might<00:02:36.190> not<00:02:36.340> be

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
the interface those might not be

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.310 
the interface those might not be
actually<00:02:37.030> resolved<00:02:37.600> by<00:02:37.690> people<00:02:37.990> using<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
actually resolved by people using the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.630 
actually resolved by people using the
keyboard<00:02:38.500> device<00:02:38.890> because<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.280> actually

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
keyboard device because it's actually

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.120 
keyboard device because it's actually
less<00:02:40.210> real<00:02:40.480> estate<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.530> obviously<00:02:41.680> there<00:02:42.100> are

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
less real estate but obviously there are

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.530 
less real estate but obviously there are
the<00:02:42.280> people<00:02:42.550> who<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.910> keyboard<00:02:43.090> device

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the people who like the keyboard device

the people who like the keyboard device
to<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.230> obvious<00:02:44.710> in<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.890> next<00:02:45.070> few<00:02:45.160> weeks

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to and and obvious in the next few weeks

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.740 
to and and obvious in the next few weeks
we'll<00:02:45.580> get<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> good<00:02:45.880> read<00:02:46.030> on<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.180> will<00:02:46.630> be

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
we'll get a good read on that will be

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.740 
we'll get a good read on that will be
closely<00:02:46.990> watching<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.590> one
