00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
were surfacing on same deal when

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.290 
were surfacing on same deal when
flipping<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.850> they're<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
popping up on it and then just let it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
popping up on it and then just let it
fall<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.640> they're<00:00:41.910> put<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.930> little

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
pop-up and whereas i would get like one

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
of five one of six a couple days ago

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.430 
of five one of six a couple days ago
today<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.460> maybe<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> 15<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
today it was maybe like one of 15 one of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
today it was maybe like one of 15 one of
20<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.070> actually<00:00:53.399> surfaced<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.910> boiled<00:00:54.210> on

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
20 that actually surfaced are boiled on

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.729 
20 that actually surfaced are boiled on
the<00:00:54.570> bait<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.020> i'd<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.350> end<00:00:55.680> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the bait that i'd actually end up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
the bait that i'd actually end up
cooking<00:00:55.920> may<00:00:56.640> i<00:00:56.670> call<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> decent<00:00:57.210> limit

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
cooking may i call it a decent limit

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
cooking may i call it a decent limit
when<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:57.960> comes<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.430> end

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
when it comes down to it and in the end

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.670 
when it comes down to it and in the end
i<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.180> fishing<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.930> fish<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
i was really fishing for one fish so I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
i was really fishing for one fish so I
kind<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.039> fish<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.480> faster<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
kind of fish a little bit faster and I

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
kind of fish a little bit faster and I
fished<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.500> weirder<00:01:05.010> stuff<00:01:05.369> i<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.939> i

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
fished some weirder stuff i just i

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
fished some weirder stuff i just i
focused<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.780> stuff<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.530> had<00:01:07.860> i<00:01:08.159> flipped

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
focused on stuff that i had i flipped

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
focused on stuff that i had i flipped
some<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.030> stretches<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> also

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
some of my stretches but then I also

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
some of my stretches but then I also
just<00:01:10.619> finish<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.130> stuff<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.549> nobody<00:01:11.820> was

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
just finish some stuff that nobody was

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
just finish some stuff that nobody was
fishing<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.840> getting<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
fishing because it's getting kind of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.609 
fishing because it's getting kind of
beat<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.560> out<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.420> blom<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
beat up out here blom one thing that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.380 
beat up out here blom one thing that
that<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.130> factored<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> think

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that really factored in that I think

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
that really factored in that I think
kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> weirded<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> fish<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
kind of weirded the fish out was the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
kind of weirded the fish out was the
waters<00:01:20.189> come<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.090> cause<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.720> bit

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
waters come up and that's cause the bit

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
waters come up and that's cause the bit
of<00:01:21.990> muddiness<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.150> flooded

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
of muddiness and it also it's flooded

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
of muddiness and it also it's flooded
some<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.020> stuff<00:01:25.290> whereas<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.860> was

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
some of this stuff whereas this was

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
some of this stuff whereas this was
almost<00:01:26.759> gravel<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:28.170> 45<00:01:28.710> days<00:01:28.890> ago<00:01:29.189> without

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
almost gravel about 45 days ago without

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.670 
almost gravel about 45 days ago without
enough<00:01:29.759> rain<00:01:30.030> where<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
enough rain where it's put about it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.230 
enough rain where it's put about it
depends<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> five

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
depends where you are but two to five

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
depends where you are but two to five
inches<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.689> water<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> things<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
inches of water on the things so I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
inches of water on the things so I
thought<00:01:35.729> they'd<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> bank<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.930> be

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
thought they'd be on the bank to be

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
thought they'd be on the bank to be
honest<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.130> didn't<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.880> think

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
honest with you but I didn't get I think

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
honest with you but I didn't get I think
I<00:01:39.180> caught<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.750> off<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.350> bank<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> he<00:01:40.829> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
