password or we need to know how to give

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.749 
password or we need to know how to give
the<00:00:09.750> user<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> option<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.340> change<00:00:11.490> their

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
password if they need to need to so this

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.769 
password if they need to need to so this
shouldn't<00:00:15.660> take<00:00:15.839> too<00:00:15.870> many<00:00:16.279> parts<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.779> video

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
shouldn't take too many parts of video

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.160 
shouldn't take too many parts of video
probably<00:00:19.470> two<00:00:20.130> parts<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.609> think<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> Emacs<00:00:21.210> but

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
probably two parts I think of Emacs but

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.210 
probably two parts I think of Emacs but
what<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.410> basically<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
what we're basically going to do is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.590 
what we're basically going to do is
we're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> give<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> user<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> form

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
we're going to give the user a form

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
we're going to give the user a form
we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.410> say<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.800> type<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.250> old

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
we're going to say to them type your old

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.730 
we're going to say to them type your old
password<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> new<00:00:27.150> password<00:00:27.330> twice<00:00:27.750> we're

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
password in the new password twice we're

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.990 
password in the new password twice we're
going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> check<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> role<00:00:29.340> password<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
going to check the role password to the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370 
going to check the role password to the
one<00:00:30.119> that's<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> database<00:00:30.630> remember

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
one that's in the database remember

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930 
one that's in the database remember
they're<00:00:31.500> encrypted<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
they're encrypted and we're going to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.580 
they're encrypted and we're going to
compare<00:00:33.120> their<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:33.600> new<00:00:33.780> passwords<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.440> see

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
compare their two new passwords to see

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350 
compare their two new passwords to see
if<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:34.770> match<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> haven't<00:00:35.940> made<00:00:36.090> any

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
if they match so if I haven't made any

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
if they match so if I haven't made any
mistakes<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.079> then<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> update

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
mistakes and then we're going to update

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
mistakes and then we're going to update
the<00:00:38.250> database<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> use

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the database which we're going to use

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.110 
the database which we're going to use
some<00:00:40.020> new<00:00:40.200> SQL<00:00:40.710> code<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> useful<00:00:41.730> for

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
some new SQL code so this is useful for

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
some new SQL code so this is useful for
that<00:00:42.600> s<00:00:42.719> QR<00:00:43.050> code<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.890> already<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.219> how

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that s QR code if you already know how

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
that s QR code if you already know how
to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> rest<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.440> okay<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.620> slow

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to do the rest of it okay it's slow

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
to do the rest of it okay it's slow

the login we need to give them a form to

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.959 
the login we need to give them a form to
fill<00:01:58.329> out<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.259> I'm<00:01:59.319> just<00:01:59.439> going<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.649> echo<00:01:59.920> out

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
fill out so I'm just going to echo out

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.889 
fill out so I'm just going to echo out
some<00:02:00.969> code<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.479> this<00:02:02.319> is<00:02:02.380> going<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.710> be<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.039> form

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
some code and this is going to be a form

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.690 
some code and this is going to be a form
it's<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:05.020> self<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.060> self<00:02:08.459> submitting<00:02:09.459> form

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it's a self it's a self submitting form

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.309 
it's a self it's a self submitting form
so<00:02:09.849> it's<00:02:09.970> going<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.149> go<00:02:10.299> back<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.660> password

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
so it's going to go back to password

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.680 
so it's going to go back to password
change<00:02:11.680> password<00:02:12.069> at<00:02:12.190> PHP<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.330> back<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.860 
increase isn't going to be a password
type<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.709> it's<00:02:38.829> not<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.160> blank<00:02:39.340> out<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
create a input type as a password so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.430 
create a input type as a password so
that's<00:02:57.370> hidden<00:02:57.790> from<00:02:57.910> everyone<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.290> name

then a break after that we can just

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.069 
then a break after that we can just
basically<00:03:05.139> copy<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.889> line<00:03:06.069> down<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.079> just

to change the variable name of this to

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.150 
to change the variable name of this to
repeat<00:03:15.579> new<00:03:16.139> already<00:03:17.139> Oh<00:03:17.170> new<00:03:17.380> password<00:03:17.769> so

so let's tidy this up a bit what we need
to<00:04:38.470> do<00:04:38.590> here<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:39.010> create<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:40.330> statement<00:04:40.480> to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
to do here is create a if statement to

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.500 
to do here is create a if statement to
say<00:04:41.620> if<00:04:42.270> post<00:04:43.680> submit<00:04:44.760> this<00:04:45.760> basically<00:04:46.210> means

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
say if post submit this basically means

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.440 
say if post submit this basically means
has<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.470> user<00:04:47.980> pressed<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.550> submit<00:04:48.730> button

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
and the name is submit therefore we've

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.060 
and the name is submit therefore we've
got<00:04:52.000> submit<00:04:52.360> written<00:04:52.540> here<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:53.320> if<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.950> user

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
got submit written here and if the user

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.970 
because if the user hasn't already
submitted<00:05:07.900> then<00:05:08.350> they're<00:05:08.530> going<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.740> need<00:05:08.830> to

check and here what we're going to do is
just<00:05:16.419> echo<00:05:16.660> out<00:05:16.900> test'<00:05:17.200> to<00:05:17.530> check<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.860> this

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
just echo out test' to check that this

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.909 
just echo out test' to check that this
works<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:19.180> we<00:05:19.390> can<00:05:19.419> go<00:05:19.630> back<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:20.110> we<00:05:20.350> can<00:05:20.560> fill
