00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.219

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.299
 The things that Isabel said was about a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.820
 compound that some post that I took 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.799

 There's k that already has boldo. 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the video she talks how many times you have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.009
 What if I take this compound and love it? 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700
 But there are several brands looking for 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.579
 post it with more funds well and well 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.799
 find in the natural products store 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.990

 a name I took called called 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 aimu of a plate at least I want to 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.180
 to know through you is about diets where 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.210
 carbohydrate management is low to my 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.060
 25% still suffered from binge eating 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.729
 I would not say it would reduce and it 's carbohydrate 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.770
 or take any carbohydrate Diet 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.590
 which indicates you have searched add 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.629
 is doing a re-education 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.280
 food is what I tell people 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.849
 There is no one to restrain food. 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.129
 none 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.959
 We need all the food in the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.670
 our diet all food all 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.769
 nutrients for people of a disease 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.569
 healthy way so I do not indicate it 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.519
 including realized every corner strip 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.780
 radically carbohydrate anyway 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.250
 so I did not say looked for a 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.330
 nutritionist and re-education 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 to feed 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.019
 It's because we have to learn to eat. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.000
 and does not restrict food to the next 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.660
 Question from cia rodrigues 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.180
 granola this question is fattening olive oil 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.150
 granola that you see existed 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.560
 the fame that loves cheese at last sicily 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.670
 is a clear example that asks here 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.799
 Because she's talking a lot of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.079
 thing cut cheese that rains just is already 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.239
 hard to find 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.970
 fat bars make you fat 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.739
 following this is the typical characteristic is 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.170
 persecutor to the reader who has just 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.720

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.200

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.540
 attention everything fattens less water 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 including natural organic products 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.220
 gluten Gluten finally with lactose 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.709
 everything is fattening then what is important 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.170
 following which according to the scientist speaks 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.790
 follow the correct quantities and I 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.200
 Example counted in the process of 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.239
 weight loss beyond 20 proofs 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 are three rice berry lie that ever 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.250
 said it but I ate 3 clay and today 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.200

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.239
 hairy like that is belly energy 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.260
 get fat though if you're not going to train 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.250
 will get you fat 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.690
 then who is in the process of 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.970
 weight loss beware of 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.040
 but clogged and brown 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.910
 Para brown nut is good and it goes 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.650
 fatten 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.560
 so it's not there, you have to be careful 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.060
 Looking for a nutritionist 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.290
 correct quantities that you have to 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.540
 digest 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.709
 It's for you to really succeed in your 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.630

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.639
 the famous energy balls fatten 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.859

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.239
 regularity in tabatinga or puc tupi 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.700
 marie energetics for the issue will 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.859

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.420
 fattening fat granola short people 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.130
 Let's take care of the company. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.570
 the next question falls on the good paula 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.299
 Later Jorge discovers you have to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.470
 keep a diet for me maria lost 11 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.260
 pounds 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.600
 Following your tips, cool people, I 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.330
 I have it, I work out at 6 o'clock in the morning. 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.919
 so you need to depend only on the pounds 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.810
 without losing lean mass then she who 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.800
 to lose weight only she does not want to lose 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.660
 lean mass 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.700
 I wanted a hint of what to eat before and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.980
 after training is important before 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.010
 training has a half-carbohydrate source 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.840
 45 minutes will be two bananas or 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.120
 then a sandwich even with a bit of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.520
 ricotta with whole wheat bread and train 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.110
 take breakfast suddenly train 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.930
 or if you will train at 6 o'clock 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 morning like an apple banana anyway a 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.560
 photo to train without precise energy 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.120
 mainly to lose but the brand 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.800
 what do you want to lose? 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.210
 after workout if you do not want to lose 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.610
 a call or want to win 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.560
 Lean Fat Eliminate Fat You Can Already 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.470
 eating a protein can take a dose 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.150
 of law is suddenly important to whoever 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.360
 either do not want to lose lean mass 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.610
 finished exercising and already eating 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.550
 because then why it happens when you do 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.320
 exercise people is after an hour that 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.060
 we just exercised our body 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.650
 still burning right 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.840
 if you eat right after you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.570
 stop this burning even burning 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.729
 a call at last if you interrupt 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.550
 in the case who lose weight generally 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.530
 What happened to me and I know that 80 pounds 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.570
 I wait up to 40 minutes to eat because 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.280
 You still burn afterwards. 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.200
 to do gym this is a tip 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.210
 important thing is then to take a 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.940
 dose of knee and if you want little 6 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.610
 banana also with the dose of law that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.800
 replenishes carbohydrate you replenish protein and 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.600
 then you will gain mass and will decrease 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.490
 the fat you want to avoid 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.380
 Ana Paula a kiss for you series 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.419
 next question issued a question 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.630
 because you prefer collagen powder 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.729
 instead of capsules or liquid it is taste 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.490
 even if there's no difference 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.710
 no I take powder I like powder 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.330
 the important thing is always associated with me 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.460
 I spent here coaxing you to work 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.200
 the day tip for you here associated with 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.840
 other vitamins to make it easier for 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.300
 your body can absorb 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.860
 correct collagen is then this is 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.080
 important is the collagen tip that 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.789
 Look who's got a fat answer. 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.180
 including the last one I recorded has the 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.250
 collagen tip that tone 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.600
 I say cheaper, cooler anyway 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.250
 functional courage 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.800
 denis flÃ¡via the following question what 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.389
 says about following the right diet but 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.490
 arrived an hour and goes crazy to 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.160
 eat something specific and if not 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.430
 eat told me I hope in my case always 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.320
 a sweet the following forming said 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.770
 desperation has to deal 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.199
 You gotta take the candy out of your life. 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.150
 I took it and on the course that I'm giving 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.430
 People, I explain how you do it. 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.110
 now if it's once a week and repeat 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.729
 a weekend what I do for 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.599
 For example, I feel like eating candy. 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:04.460
 I with two chocolate tablets is is 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:06.199
 70% cocoa, right? 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.139
 you can suddenly do it if you train 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:12.080
 how a tablet will train super energy 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.570
 if you can eat at 70% cocoa I at the end of 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.400
 week for example i love mar banana 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.110
 game honey on top with granola and how 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.030
