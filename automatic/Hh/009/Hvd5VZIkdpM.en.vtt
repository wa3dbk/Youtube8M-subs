00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.720
 all right 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.170
 i 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.459
 I know it's a bit late because 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.799
 We're almost at the end of July and 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.580
 I still had not brought the clothes so I 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 here it is 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:33.390
 in June read two books and has 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:36.700
 abandoned one that is surely in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.220
 moments of grace and good at the end 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.500
 it can be read less than I expected 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.559
 in July I am also reading little but 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.449
 I hope that from today that day 17 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:55.330
 although video 2 public thirst and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:57.040
 start reading a lot more at your leisure 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.809
 metro call and I tell you what I say 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.970
 the first book I read in June was 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.640
 we will always have summer left nÃ­jar 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.180
 the third of the summer trilogy the saga 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.610
 super cheesy I already told you but not 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 you have something that I love this book 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.440
 It was very exciting I had a really bad time 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.600
 with him because 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.400
 the last pages arrived and I was 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.260
 all made a mess and it was like my god 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.570
 how are you going to solve this I have been 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.220
 happy with the saga and I think I 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.810
 I would encourage you to read more about the author 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 I also read things 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.140
 watley de marley gibson expected a 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.240
 little bit more of this first book because 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
 the scores in weeks are pretty 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.890
 high but the truth is that it does not have 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.360
 nothing special entertaining is fine 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.210
 written the protagonist is cool but I do not know 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 it lacks something that distinguishes it from loder 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.460
 I 'm still thinking if I 'm going to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 continue so if I do, you'll see 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.010
 the next books in a meme too 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.560
 I read the undesirables of dying mcgowan the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.040
 first book of a new saga post 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.870
 apocalyptic dystopian etcetera by 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.820
 now they are two books I do not know if they will be three 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.700
 or when they will be and the truth is that I 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.280
 He was pleasantly surprised because he did not 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.960
 I expected a lot from the book and I found 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.540
 with a well-built universe a 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.270
 pretty interesting protagonist and in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.760
 general a very good book 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 well written I think I recommend it 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.240
 I'm quite looking forward to reading the second 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.830
 part because I'm going to fool you by following 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.470
 the same line also him and minds 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 mighty alexandra croak in the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 first of a trilogy within this 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.070
 wave of dystopian books and post 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.560
 apocalyptic and others I think they bring 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.170
 something new I liked the roll a lot 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 road suite of the book although there are some 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.540
 things that were coming to the end 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.400
 it left absolutely open-mouthed so 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.600
 If you have the opportunity to read it, 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.150
 I really recommend it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.940
 I finally read Miguel Sanz step write 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.550
 which is the continuation of across the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.470
 universe or wake up a million suns in 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.090
 Spanish is called so close and I 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 disappointed a little because the truth is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.830
 which I thought was very predictable and although 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.780
 it is very well written because it is not 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.390
 I expected maybe a little bit more I have the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.970
 third part waiting and I would like 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.040
 can read it soon but we'll see 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.770
 when will surely be the most read 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.770
 disappointments of this I was former cults 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.370
 if there are already two like that the first book 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.490
 I liked it a lot and I expected a lot from 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.390
 second but I found it slow not 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.819
 nothing happens 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.610
 the characters become all 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.690
 completely stupid and by generating no 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.290
 I know the truth is that I was disappointed 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.050
 pretty and good I'll give it a try 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.090
 to the third book but 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.030
 if it does not come back the truth is that I think 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.190
 will pass without grief or glory for me 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.010
 life another book that I did not like 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.990
 Nothing this even less if it was final 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.390
 of fitzpatrick scholarship in fourth and last 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.490
 book of the saga high there is a saga that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 it started good 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.860
 an entertaining passable book 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.740
 nothing of the other world but the truth that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.500
 halle but it was plummeting by 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.660
 full each book I was more 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.910
 tedious than the previous one and the truth is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.950
 I've read the endings and I do not even know how 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.830
 could finish it because there was a 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.739
 sovereign cognac I do not like them now I do not 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.560
 like patch I do not like the scenarios 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.520
 or nothing or is that I do not like anything 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.070
 I the truth that if I had to decide 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.540
 now whether to read or not the saga knowing what 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.240
 that I'm going to find no joy 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.220
 I have also read pure of giuliana vagos 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 It's a book that I had a lot of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.510
 respect because the review was very 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.410
 positive but I did not know if he gave me 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.210
 like it or not 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.890
 however giuliana wagon has 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.590
 surprised with the world he creates in 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.230
 pure a very raw world completely 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.240
 devastated and some characters very well 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.460
 built and I really want to read 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.310
 merger that its continuation is very 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.740
 original is very well written the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.360
 good story maybe he sins of being a 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.680
 little slow at first but the truth 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.690
 is that 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.789
 I think he proper to history 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.320
 that tells us another one that has also 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.600
 much liked has been the careers of 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.490
 scorpio de banesto and facha is a 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.050
 author that I fall in love with the logos of 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.430
 merci falls and the truth is that the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.650
 scorpio careers a novel that I 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.320
 has surprised me in many ways I did not 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.810
 I expected it that way and I liked it a lot 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.470
 all the ideas of water horses 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.050
 I thought it was very well taken is raw 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.940
 It has pretty strong scenes and also 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.090
 It is a beautiful story of love and 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.099
 brothers and finally a book that deserves 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.380
 Sorry Alegro waited like May water 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:42.070
 the continuation of jennifer obsidian 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.289
 the Armenian who is onyx you are admitted 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.599
 in love I know that it's really super 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.090
 typical full of topics and all that roll 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.610
 but I love it as I said in the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.560
 Onix review breaks a bit with the 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.410
 topics that presented us help 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.539
 which makes even more and what I like 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.950
 I can tell you that I love cate and I 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.930
 I love I love it 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.580
 and I really want to read the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.320
 so I hope it's not too late 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.730
 much the book that has slowed my streak 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.580
 the extra this media has been the shock of 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.100
 kings of george rr martin as you know 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.930
 He is very fat and I take something more than 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.880
 time to read it than the other books that 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.430
 I read this month I liked it a lot without 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.560
 But I think a little slower than 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.720
 the game of thrones but it's still a 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.420
 advanced and now I hope I can get 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.030
 soon with storm of swords and ends 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.130
 the month with anna from the hell of 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.420
 kinder plate that disappointed me a little 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.830
 the truth 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.960
 anna dressed in blood was a book that 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.720
 I liked it a lot, it's not that it's 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.360
 wonderful but I liked it was original 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.330
 I had a cool character and all that but 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.970
 anna from hell slower is 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.139
 loose and until the last page seems 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.930
 like what 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.969
 It does not take off, it 's a shame because the 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.650
 reality in the end is quite adequate and 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.139
 pretty good but the rest of the book 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.879
 it feels like very empty and the last 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.060
 book in which I am going to speak to you is my 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:05.069
 name and it's mary d ambrosio I 'm not 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.249
 sure if I left it in May or in 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.810
 June I think it was in June but I did not 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:11.580
 agreement the question is that I started to 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.560
 read it and I was getting bored 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.450
 sovereignly I was not liking anything 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.600
 he has been reading for several days 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.270
 little bit and I said I do not want to continue with this 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.300
 book I tried to give him another chance 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.490
 but nothing there was no way 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.800
 so unfortunately he has gone to the drawer 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.750
 of the abandoned books and with this 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.750
 I finish Europe of the month 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.509
 If you want to comment something about one of 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.569
 those books you can leave the comments 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:45.430
 both in the youtube channel and in the 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:47.650
 blog and I hope we see each other soon 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.889
 thank you very much everyone and a million 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.889
 of kisses
