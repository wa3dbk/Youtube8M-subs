can't cooler a cheaters go on

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
can't cooler a cheaters go on
transformation<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> honestly<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
transformation and honestly just like I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
transformation and honestly just like I
said<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> couple<00:00:33.510> weeks<00:00:33.960> ago<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.350> we

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
said a couple weeks ago when we

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
said a couple weeks ago when we
originally<00:00:34.920> discussed<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:36.180> freezes<00:00:36.690> family

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
originally discussed if freezes family

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
originally discussed if freezes family
could<00:00:37.079> she<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.320> potential<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.309> no<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
could she was potential I think no I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
could she was potential I think no I
don't<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.059> cooler<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.660> achieve<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
don't think cooler can achieve the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930 
don't think cooler can achieve the
transformation<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.340> main<00:00:41.489> reason<00:00:41.820> why

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
transformation and the main reason why

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
transformation and the main reason why
is<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:43.140> revealed<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> movie

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is because it's revealed in this movie

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
is because it's revealed in this movie
in<00:00:44.399> focus<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> web<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.480> Frieza<00:00:46.170> has

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
in focus on the web that Frieza has

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
in focus on the web that Frieza has
never<00:00:46.920> trained<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.879> its<00:00:48.120> life<00:00:48.300> meaning

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
never trained at a in its life meaning

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740 
never trained at a in its life meaning
the<00:00:49.530> second<00:00:49.980> he<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.489> second<00:00:50.940> old<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the second he was one second old that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
the second he was one second old that
was<00:00:51.870> his<00:00:51.960> parlor<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.410> that's<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.800> strong<00:00:53.610> as

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
was his parlor one that's as strong as

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.950 
was his parlor one that's as strong as
you<00:00:53.850> got<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:54.570> figure<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.870> he

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you got you know and then figure out he

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
you got you know and then figure out he
could<00:00:55.079> transform<00:00:55.710> further<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.789> base

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
could transform further and then base

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.650 
could transform further and then base
them<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:57.840> his<00:00:57.960> life<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.559> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
transformation kind of most part is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.869 
transformation kind of most part is
power<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:01.949> who<00:01:02.160> freezes<00:01:02.460> become

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

cool<00:01:25.830> point<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.330> how<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.930> know

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cool point and because of how you know

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.670 
cool point and because of how you know
his<00:01:28.170> younger

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
his younger

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.179 
his younger
golden<00:01:29.280> star<00:01:29.570> brother<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.810> cooler<00:01:31.770> probably

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
golden star brother was cooler probably

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.980 
golden star brother was cooler probably
had<00:01:32.310> more<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> incentive<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.659> stronger

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
had more of a incentive to get stronger

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
had more of a incentive to get stronger
he<00:01:34.259> wanted<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.590> above<00:01:34.950> his<00:01:35.100> brother<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.579> wanted

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
he wanted be above his brother he wanted

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060 
he wanted be above his brother he wanted
to<00:01:35.880> poop<00:01:36.119> onto<00:01:36.360> his<00:01:36.570> family<00:01:36.990> cooler<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> had

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to poop onto his family cooler just had

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.149 
to poop onto his family cooler just had
to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.400> cooler<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.119> his<00:01:39.390> name<00:01:39.509> says<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
to be cooler as his name says and

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
to be cooler as his name says and
because<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> feel<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.880> no<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
because of that I feel like no the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
because of that I feel like no the
cooler<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> revenge<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.040> cooler

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
cooler we see in the revenge of cooler

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
cooler we see in the revenge of cooler
and<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> return<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> cooler<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.840> strong

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and the return of cooler are as strong

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.840 
and the return of cooler are as strong
as<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> gets<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.040> powerful<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.610> cooler

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
as it gets that's as powerful as cooler

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
as it gets that's as powerful as cooler
is<00:01:48.000> ever<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.840> main<00:01:49.259> reason<00:01:49.470> why

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
is ever going to get and main reason why

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.630 
is ever going to get and main reason why
is<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.250> feel<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.430> he<00:01:50.610> just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is because I just feel like he just

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.370 
is because I just feel like he just
trained<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.689> entire<00:01:51.930> life

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
trained the entire life

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
trained the entire life
so<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.399> stronger<00:01:53.700> than<00:01:53.820> his<00:01:53.909> brother<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so get be stronger than his brother and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
so get be stronger than his brother and
at<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> point<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.170> stronger<00:01:55.560> than<00:01:55.590> his

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
at that point he was stronger than his

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.319 
at that point he was stronger than his
brother<00:01:56.009> he<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.490> stronger<00:01:56.759> his<00:01:57.000> brother

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
brother he was way stronger his brother

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
brother he was way stronger his brother
but<00:01:57.719> again<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> difference<00:01:58.409> between<00:01:58.439> cooler

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
but again the difference between cooler

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
but again the difference between cooler
and<00:01:59.070> freezer<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.549> freezer<00:01:59.850> never<00:02:00.119> trained<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and freezer is freezer never trained and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749 
and freezer is freezer never trained and
cooler<00:02:01.140> did<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> cooler<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.070> surpass<00:02:02.460> them

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
cooler did and cooler can surpass them

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.050 
cooler did and cooler can surpass them
by<00:02:02.909> training<00:02:03.390> whereas<00:02:04.020> Frieza<00:02:04.790> spent<00:02:05.790> six

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
by training whereas Frieza spent six

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.340 
by training whereas Frieza spent six
months<00:02:06.299> training<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.780> gotten<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
months training for gotten off and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.440 
months training for gotten off and
achieve<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.879> incredible<00:02:08.879> power<00:02:09.149> boost

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
achieve this incredible power boost

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.360 
achieve this incredible power boost
where<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.050> match<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> gods<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:11.129> that's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
where you can match the gods like that's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.809 
where you can match the gods like that's
the<00:02:11.489> difference<00:02:11.970> between<00:02:12.000> cooler

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
the difference between cooler

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.940 
the difference between cooler
so<00:02:13.150> because<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.719> again<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.499> cooler<00:02:14.799> we

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
so because of that again the cooler we

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.989 
so because of that again the cooler we
see<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.219> movie<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.489> feel<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.760> that's<00:02:15.849> a

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
see in the movie I feel like that's a

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.489 
see in the movie I feel like that's a
strong<00:02:16.299> as<00:02:16.420> you'll<00:02:16.510> get<00:02:16.659> I<00:02:16.780> mean<00:02:16.900> he<00:02:16.989> even<00:02:17.139> says

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:17.499 
strong as you'll get I mean he even says

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.080 
strong as you'll get I mean he even says
I<00:02:17.680> figure<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.099> way<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.790> find

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
I figure out a way to find

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.030 
I figure out a way to find
transformation<00:02:19.780> above<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.469> my<00:02:20.560> brother<00:02:20.799> had

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
transformation above what my brother had

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.369 
transformation above what my brother had
and<00:02:21.280> that's<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.450> now<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.840> was<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.139> you<00:02:23.230> got

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
and that's it now that was all you got

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.780 
and that's it now that was all you got
then<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:23.739> freeze<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.099> had<00:02:24.219> this<00:02:24.340> quote-unquote

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
then one freeze I had this quote-unquote

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.899 
then one freeze I had this quote-unquote
transformation<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.950> gave<00:02:27.280> them<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.549> power

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
transformation it gave them a power

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.580 
transformation it gave them a power
level<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.329> massive<00:02:28.989> chart<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.439> that's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
level in the massive chart and that's

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.020 
level in the massive chart and that's
basically<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.219> density<00:02:30.760> both<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:30.969> these

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
basically the density both of these

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.849 
basically the density both of these
characters<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:31.659> to<00:02:31.719> answer<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.650> first

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
characters so to answer the first

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.830 
characters so to answer the first
question<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.489> don't<00:02:33.909> say<00:02:34.000> cool<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.420> transport

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
question I don't say cool can transport

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.940 
question I don't say cool can transport
just<00:02:34.989> because<00:02:35.290> he<00:02:35.379> had<00:02:35.469> our<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.709> reach<00:02:35.829> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
just because he had our to reach the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.979 
just because he had our to reach the
potential<00:02:36.430> whereas<00:02:37.030> Frieza<00:02:37.450> hasn't<00:02:37.930> even

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
potential whereas Frieza hasn't even

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.659 
potential whereas Frieza hasn't even
tapped<00:02:38.439> a<00:02:38.590> tooth<00:02:38.739> potential<00:02:39.219> so<00:02:39.340> that's<00:02:39.489> kind

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
tapped a tooth potential so that's kind

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.220 
tapped a tooth potential so that's kind
of<00:02:39.700> dense<00:02:39.879> between<00:02:40.480> both<00:02:40.719> of<00:02:40.840> these<00:02:40.900> brothers

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
of dense between both of these brothers

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
of dense between both of these brothers
now<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.859> question<00:02:42.219> is<00:02:42.280> let's<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:42.819> say<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
now the question is let's just say you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.709 
now the question is let's just say you
know<00:02:43.540> cooler<00:02:43.840> does<00:02:44.700> achieve<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.000> know<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:46.719 
know cooler does achieve you know this

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.819 
know cooler does achieve you know this
transformation<00:02:47.290> could<00:02:47.379> eat<00:02:47.500> defeat<00:02:47.620> his

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
transformation could eat defeat his

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.129 
transformation could eat defeat his
brother<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.219> today<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> still<00:02:48.939> say<00:02:49.209> no<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.959> don't

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
brother and today I still say no I don't

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.479 
brother and today I still say no I don't
think<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.349> can<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.949> the<00:02:51.040> main<00:02:51.189> reason<00:02:51.219> why

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
think you can and the main reason why

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.679 
think you can and the main reason why
again<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.849> just<00:02:51.909> goes<00:02:52.090> back<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.449> whole

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
again it just goes back to the whole

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.929 
again it just goes back to the whole
idea<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.500> feel<00:02:53.919> like<00:02:54.069> you<00:02:54.280> know<00:02:54.370> freeze<00:02:54.730> up

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
idea of I feel like you know freeze up

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.879 
idea of I feel like you know freeze up
it's<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.599> lot<00:02:55.750> more<00:02:55.900> powerful<00:02:56.199> if<00:02:56.469> you<00:02:56.650> try

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
it's just a lot more powerful if you try

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:57.869 
it's just a lot more powerful if you try
like<00:02:57.129> if<00:02:57.280> Frieza

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
like if Frieza

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.970 
like if Frieza
we<00:02:58.419> need<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.659> try<00:02:58.870> try<00:02:59.169> for<00:02:59.409> six<00:02:59.590> months<00:02:59.859> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
we need to try try for six months and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.439 
we need to try try for six months and
choose<00:03:00.189> transformation<00:03:00.819> where<00:03:01.000> has<00:03:01.150> cooler

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:01.449 
choose transformation where has cooler

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.689 
choose transformation where has cooler
spend<00:03:01.780> his<00:03:01.840> entire<00:03:01.930> life<00:03:02.199> training<00:03:02.409> and<00:03:03.069> only

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:03.699 
spend his entire life training and only

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.189 
spend his entire life training and only
achieve<00:03:04.030> if<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.629> know<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.989> next

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
achieve if you know the next

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.720 
achieve if you know the next
transformation<00:03:05.769> in<00:03:05.919> line<00:03:06.099> which<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:06.549> in

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
transformation in line which we see in

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.939 
transformation in line which we see in
return<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.209> cooler<00:03:07.359> so<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.139> feel<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:08.739> if

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:08.949 
return of cooler so like I feel like if

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.800 
return of cooler so like I feel like if
all<00:03:09.219> these<00:03:09.370> characters<00:03:09.760> were<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.510> level

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
all these characters were on the level

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.439 
all these characters were on the level
of<00:03:10.930> gold<00:03:11.319> at<00:03:11.560> least<00:03:11.739> um<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:13.120> feel<00:03:13.329> like

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:13.449 
of gold at least um I just feel like

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.879 
of gold at least um I just feel like
because<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.780> freezes<00:03:14.079> power<00:03:14.260> unlimited

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
because of freezes power unlimited

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.149 
because of freezes power unlimited
potential<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.519> his<00:03:15.609> body<00:03:15.790> he<00:03:16.480> has<00:03:16.689> that<00:03:17.159> above

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
potential in his body he has that above

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.469 
potential in his body he has that above
his<00:03:18.280> brother<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.729> because<00:03:18.939> they<00:03:19.090> were<00:03:19.329> in<00:03:19.419> a

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:19.479 
his brother and because they were in a

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.210 
his brother and because they were in a
fight<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.229> that's<00:03:20.409> what<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.590> think<00:03:20.919> like<00:03:21.069> this

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
fight so that's what I think like this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.199 
fight so that's what I think like this
is<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.699> is<00:03:21.759> kind<00:03:21.909> of<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.030> weird

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
is I know this is kind of a weird

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.759 
is I know this is kind of a weird
conversation<00:03:22.509> to<00:03:22.900> have<00:03:23.019> but<00:03:23.139> again<00:03:23.229> I've

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
conversation to have but again I've

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.339 
conversation to have but again I've
gotten<00:03:24.069> a<00:03:24.129> lot<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.340> requests<00:03:24.759> to<00:03:25.540> give<00:03:26.259> I

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
gotten a lot of requests to give I

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.990 
gotten a lot of requests to give I
thought<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:26.859> there<00:03:27.099> was<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.250> golden<00:03:27.489> cooler<00:03:27.729> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
thought if there was a golden cooler and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.789 
thought if there was a golden cooler and
this<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.359> I<00:03:28.389> think<00:03:28.479> so<00:03:28.959> what<00:03:29.439> do<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> guys

this is what I think so what do you guys

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.319 
this is what I think so what do you guys
think<00:03:29.859> so<00:03:30.280> basically<00:03:30.699> everything<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.120> said<00:03:31.299> I

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
think so basically everything I said I

want to hear your personal thoughts

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.979 
want to hear your personal thoughts
maybe<00:03:33.759> even<00:03:34.030> throw<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.419> golden<00:03:34.659> key<00:03:34.780> know

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
maybe even throw in the golden key know

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.360 
maybe even throw in the golden key know
what<00:03:35.109> that's<00:03:35.709> cold<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:36.099> because<00:03:36.340> I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
what that's cold just because I

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.939 
what that's cold just because I
know<00:03:36.489> it's<00:03:36.669> gonna<00:03:36.759> get<00:03:37.180> tossed<00:03:37.389> in<00:03:37.599> there

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
know it's gonna get tossed in there

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.890 
know it's gonna get tossed in there
cooking<00:03:38.949> cold<00:03:39.220> go<00:03:39.430> gold<00:03:39.729> as<00:03:39.909> well<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.389> don't

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
cooking cold go gold as well I don't

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.740 
cooking cold go gold as well I don't
think<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.169> see<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.859> way<00:03:42.009> I<00:03:42.040> know<00:03:42.970> sea<00:03:43.329> freezes

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
think so see the way I know sea freezes

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.740 
think so see the way I know sea freezes
families<00:03:44.259> I<00:03:44.349> feel<00:03:44.560> like<00:03:44.709> every<00:03:45.040> offspring

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
families I feel like every offspring

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.449 
families I feel like every offspring
kind<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.900> became<00:03:47.199> more<00:03:47.620> powerful<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.250> first

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
kind of became more powerful so first

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.460 
kind of became more powerful so first
this<00:03:48.549> can<00:03:48.790> call<00:03:49.000> who<00:03:49.239> reaches<00:03:49.540> achieved<00:03:50.379> is

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
this can call who reaches achieved is

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.499 
this can call who reaches achieved is
mass<00:03:50.680> power<00:03:50.919> level<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.459> then<00:03:52.000> he<00:03:52.120> gave<00:03:52.239> birth

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
mass power level and then he gave birth

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.199 
mass power level and then he gave birth
to<00:03:52.540> new<00:03:52.930> cooler<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.709> bond<00:03:54.459> Murphy<00:03:54.759> gave<00:03:54.879> birth<00:03:55.090> I

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
to new cooler a bond Murphy gave birth I

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.759 
to new cooler a bond Murphy gave birth I
don't<00:03:55.329> know<00:03:55.389> how<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.629> birth<00:03:56.049> system<00:03:56.409> works<00:03:56.590> in

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
don't know how the birth system works in

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.319 
don't know how the birth system works in
an<00:03:56.889> inter<00:03:57.069> family<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.729> the<00:03:57.819> next<00:03:58.030> person<00:03:58.269> in

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
an inter family but the next person in

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.119 
an inter family but the next person in
line<00:03:58.359> was<00:03:58.629> cooler<00:03:58.870> we<00:03:59.439> achieve<00:03:59.709> this<00:03:59.889> next

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
line was cooler we achieve this next

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.709 
line was cooler we achieve this next
part<00:04:00.310> level<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.699> then<00:04:00.790> here<00:04:01.000> comes<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
part level and then here comes the

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.080 
part level and then here comes the
golden<00:04:02.109> son<00:04:02.409> Frieza<00:04:03.159> was<00:04:03.459> its<00:04:03.699> extreme

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
golden son Frieza was its extreme

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.059 
golden son Frieza was its extreme
massive<00:04:04.599> parallel<00:04:05.079> he's<00:04:05.229> born<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.769> genus

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
massive parallel he's born the genus

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.920 
massive parallel he's born the genus
body<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.609> that's<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.269> created<00:04:07.599> you<00:04:07.780> know

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
body and that's what created you know

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.439 
body and that's what created you know
the<00:04:08.229> ultra<00:04:08.620> monster<00:04:09.009> and<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.189> family<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:10.030> to

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
the ultra monster and a family so to

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.849 
the ultra monster and a family so to
answer<00:04:10.599> your<00:04:10.719> question<00:04:11.079> about<00:04:11.169> king<00:04:11.439> cold

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
answer your question about king cold

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.110 
answer your question about king cold
even<00:04:12.219> though<00:04:12.310> King<00:04:12.489> Cole<00:04:12.639> could<00:04:12.849> probably

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
even though King Cole could probably

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.520 
even though King Cole could probably
reach<00:04:13.389> another<00:04:13.719> massive<00:04:14.139> power<00:04:14.289> level

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
reach another massive power level

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.409 
reach another massive power level
compared<00:04:14.949> to<00:04:15.099> freezer<00:04:15.370> hardened<00:04:15.759> amic<00:04:16.090> he

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
compared to freezer hardened amic he

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.009 
compared to freezer hardened amic he
compares<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.019> more<00:04:17.229> around<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.799> cooler<00:04:18.070> as<00:04:18.219> well

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
compares to more around a cooler as well

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.930 
compares to more around a cooler as well
don't<00:04:20.109> think<00:04:20.259> King<00:04:21.009> Cole<00:04:21.250> could<00:04:21.519> achieve<00:04:21.579> cold

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940
