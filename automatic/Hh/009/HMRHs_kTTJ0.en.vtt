and and so anytime you hear any music
during<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.770> day<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:34.090> know<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.240> be<00:04:34.479> analytical

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
during the day you know to be analytical

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.830 
during the day you know to be analytical
about<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.310> mean<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:37.389> does<00:04:37.630> make<00:04:37.810> for

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
about it and I mean it it does make for

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.870 
about it and I mean it it does make for
sometimes<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.740> fairly<00:04:39.040> depressing<00:04:39.340> existence

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
sometimes a fairly depressing existence

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.040 
sometimes a fairly depressing existence
because<00:04:40.180> much<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.540> music<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:40.840> you'll

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
because much of the music that you'll

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.629 
because much of the music that you'll
hear<00:04:41.229> during<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.770> course<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.220> given<00:04:42.340> days

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639
