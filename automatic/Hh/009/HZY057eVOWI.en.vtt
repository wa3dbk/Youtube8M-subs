got a lot of resources i was able to

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.119 
got a lot of resources i was able to
upgrade<00:00:52.239> my<00:00:52.420> radar<00:00:52.929> i<00:00:53.139> could<00:00:53.800> have<00:00:53.889> easily

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
upgrade my radar i could have easily

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.709 
upgrade my radar i could have easily
upgraded<00:00:54.729> one<00:00:54.789> of<00:00:54.879> my<00:00:54.969> landing<00:00:55.359> crafts<00:00:55.569> at

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
upgraded one of my landing crafts at

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.319 
upgraded one of my landing crafts at
seven<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.589> 17<00:00:56.889> but<00:00:57.129> i<00:00:57.159> decided<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.639> do<00:00:57.789> the

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
seven to 17 but i decided to do the

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.549 
seven to 17 but i decided to do the
radar<00:00:58.690> because<00:00:58.929> it's<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.139> little<00:00:59.319> bit<00:00:59.440> more

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
radar because it's a little bit more

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.500 
radar because it's a little bit more
expensive<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.219> harder<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:00.999> get<00:01:01.179> and<00:01:01.239> then

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
expensive and harder to get and then

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.660 
expensive and harder to get and then
that<00:01:01.749> also<00:01:01.960> means<00:01:02.350> i<00:01:02.530> can<00:01:02.710> take<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.129> hammer

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
that also means i can take on hammer

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.510 
that also means i can take on hammer
mins<00:01:03.909> HQ<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.629> think<00:01:05.019> level<00:01:05.379> 55<00:01:05.890> actually<00:01:06.430> no<00:01:06.490> I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
mins HQ I think level 55 actually no I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.420 
mins HQ I think level 55 actually no I
can't<00:01:06.850> HQ<00:01:07.450> 19<00:01:07.810> well<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.440> sucks<00:01:08.680> but<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.250> have

now on this sour grapes but two of the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.540 
now on this sour grapes but two of the
bases<00:01:37.930> are<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.260> go<00:01:38.350> down<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:39.190> like<00:01:39.370> two

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
bases are about to go down with like two

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.090 
bases are about to go down with like two
attacks<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.510> we'll<00:01:40.750> have<00:01:40.990> ten<00:01:41.410> attacks<00:01:41.770> to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
attacks so we'll have ten attacks to

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.360 
attacks so we'll have ten attacks to
take<00:01:42.400> out<00:01:42.550> two<00:01:42.730> bases<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:44.410> yeah<00:01:44.620> that's<00:01:45.190> pretty

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
take out two bases so yeah that's pretty

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.700 
take out two bases so yeah that's pretty
going<00:01:45.850> that's<00:01:46.270> going<00:01:46.450> alright<00:01:46.840> um<00:01:47.110> and<00:01:47.620> then

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
going that's going alright um and then

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.940 
going that's going alright um and then
we<00:01:47.920> lost<00:01:48.160> these<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.640> mambos<00:01:49.540> like<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.860> we

we lost these to mambos like and so we

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.860 
we lost these to mambos like and so we
text<00:01:51.220> our<00:01:51.310> groups<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> while<00:01:51.760> ago<00:01:52.030> weren't

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
although I'm getting mixed up here cuz

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.890 
although I'm getting mixed up here cuz
of<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.519> operations<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.180> was<00:03:34.540> bloatware

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
of the operations so that was bloatware

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.349 
of the operations so that was bloatware
I<00:03:35.049> don't<00:03:35.260> know<00:03:35.350> why<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.500> said<00:03:35.739> paradox<00:03:36.359> alright

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
I don't know why it said paradox alright

I'm so intensely looking at the one from
to<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.510> sour<00:03:58.690> grapes<00:03:58.959> from<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.349> today

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
to the sour grapes from the today

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.040 
to the sour grapes from the today
for<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.450> operation<00:04:01.930> at<00:04:01.990> least<00:04:02.200> though<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:02.830> b6

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
for the operation at least though I b6

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.720 
for the operation at least though I b6
he's<00:04:05.050> going<00:04:05.260> from<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.470> back<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:05.890> which<00:04:06.430> is

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
he's going from the back here which is

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.360 
he's going from the back here which is
really<00:04:07.180> really<00:04:07.360> smart<00:04:07.720> open<00:04:08.470> wide<00:04:08.770> open<00:04:09.130> for

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
really really smart open wide open for

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.790 
really really smart open wide open for
any<00:04:09.760> type<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:09.970> rush<00:04:10.600> like<00:04:10.960> a<00:04:10.990> warrior<00:04:11.260> rush<00:04:11.560> I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
any type of rush like a warrior rush I

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.680 
any type of rush like a warrior rush I
think<00:04:12.070> that's<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:12.340> Brett<00:04:12.610> did<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> good

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
think that's what Brett did so a good

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.540 
think that's what Brett did so a good
job<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.110> him<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.320> hate<00:04:14.560> how<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.800> goes<00:04:15.310> back<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
job on him I hate how it goes back to

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.580 
job on him I hate how it goes back to
the<00:04:15.700> recent<00:04:16.270> operation<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.080> then<00:04:17.110> he<00:04:17.290> took<00:04:17.440> up

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the recent operation so then he took up

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.710 
the recent operation so then he took up
that<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.370> then<00:04:18.459> Excel<00:04:18.850> was<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.390> bunch<00:04:19.510> of

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that and then Excel was just a bunch of

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.770 
that and then Excel was just a bunch of
warrior<00:04:20.170> rushes<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:21.580> more<00:04:22.000> warrior<00:04:22.390> rushes

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
warrior rushes and more warrior rushes

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.870 
warrior rushes and more warrior rushes
and<00:04:22.900> then<00:04:23.020> another<00:04:23.230> warrior<00:04:23.710> rush<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.760> then

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and then another warrior rush and then

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.770 
and then another warrior rush and then
another<00:04:25.030> warrior<00:04:25.510> rush<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.050> then<00:04:26.140> quay<00:04:26.530> um<00:04:26.860> I

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
another warrior rush and then quay um I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.880 
another warrior rush and then quay um I
don't<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:28.900> know<00:04:29.140> what<00:04:29.290> Kuwait<00:04:29.530> was<00:04:29.710> so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
we'll watch it we got ninja chicken here

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
we'll watch it we got ninja chicken here
really<00:04:32.620> strong<00:04:32.800> cuca<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:36.340> warrior

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
really strong cuca and so the warrior

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.010 
really strong cuca and so the warrior
rush<00:04:36.760> took<00:04:36.970> out<00:04:37.090> i<00:04:37.120> think<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.480> shock<00:04:37.690> launcher

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
rush took out i think a shock launcher

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.050 
rush took out i think a shock launcher
and<00:04:38.110> three<00:04:38.290> rocket<00:04:38.620> launchers<00:04:38.950> use<00:04:39.670> whose

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
and three rocket launchers use whose

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.340 
and three rocket launchers use whose
people<00:04:40.180> take<00:04:40.480> this<00:04:40.630> base<00:04:40.840> out<00:04:41.080> nice<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.540> yeah

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
people take this base out nice so yeah

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.740 
people take this base out nice so yeah
I've<00:04:44.530> been<00:04:44.710> actually<00:04:45.010> spending<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.400> lot<00:04:45.520> more

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
I've been actually spending a lot more

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.450 
I've been actually spending a lot more
power<00:04:46.750> part<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.170> normally<00:04:47.530> than<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:48.370> I'd

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
power part of normally than I what I'd

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.390 
power part of normally than I what I'd
like<00:04:48.670> but<00:04:49.450> I<00:04:49.750> have<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.440> kind<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.710> keep<00:04:51.040> my

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
like but I have to kind of keep my

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.160 
like but I have to kind of keep my
victory<00:04:52.090> points<00:04:52.360> up<00:04:52.450> where<00:04:52.600> they're<00:04:52.750> at<00:04:52.900> and

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
victory points up where they're at and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.900 
victory points up where they're at and
it's<00:04:53.470> also<00:04:53.620> kind<00:04:53.920> of<00:04:53.980> rewarding<00:04:54.370> too<00:04:54.580> because

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
it's also kind of rewarding too because

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.180 
it's also kind of rewarding too because
you<00:04:54.940> still<00:04:55.480> get<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.960> lot<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:56.800> fragments

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
you still get a lot of like fragments

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.860 
you still get a lot of like fragments
and<00:04:57.550> whatnot<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.120> kind<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.300> replenishes

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
and whatnot so it kind of replenishes

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.020 
and whatnot so it kind of replenishes
itself<00:04:59.310> but<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.370> really<00:05:00.550> want<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.730> get<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.850> Power

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
itself but I really want to get a Power

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.410 
itself but I really want to get a Power
Stone<00:05:01.300> chance<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.900> think<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.710> would<00:05:02.800> help<00:05:02.950> out

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
Stone chance I think that would help out

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.440 
Stone chance I think that would help out
so<00:05:04.420> he<00:05:04.720> did<00:05:04.870> take<00:05:05.020> out<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.290> base<00:05:05.350> nice<00:05:06.450> it's

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
so he did take out this base nice it's

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.170 
so he did take out this base nice it's
cleared<00:05:07.690> out<00:05:07.810> everything<00:05:08.670> riri<00:05:09.670> position

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
cleared out everything riri position

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.590 
cleared out everything riri position
here<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:12.250> would<00:05:12.760> win<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:12.970> one<00:05:13.270> sweet

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
here and this would win that one sweet

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.210 
here and this would win that one sweet
so<00:05:13.870> good<00:05:14.020> job<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.950> task<00:05:15.190> force<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:15.910> far<00:05:16.210> um

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
so good job to the task force so far um

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.120 
so good job to the task force so far um
and<00:05:18.220> then<00:05:18.340> soak<00:05:19.240> away<00:05:19.590> mercury<00:05:20.590> was<00:05:20.800> attacked

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
and then soak away mercury was attacked

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.970 
and then soak away mercury was attacked
a<00:05:21.250> couple<00:05:21.400> more<00:05:21.730> times<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:23.310> couple<00:05:24.310> more<00:05:24.550> times

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
a couple more times a couple more times

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.190 
a couple more times a couple more times
and<00:05:26.980> then<00:05:27.390> mercury<00:05:28.390> will<00:05:28.570> watch<00:05:28.720> this<00:05:28.990> one

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
and then mercury will watch this one

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.740 
and then mercury will watch this one
here<00:05:29.470> so<00:05:30.430> these<00:05:30.850> are<00:05:31.030> all<00:05:31.060> rocket<00:05:31.450> launchers

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
here so these are all rocket launchers

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.080 
here so these are all rocket launchers
those<00:05:31.930> all<00:05:32.110> got<00:05:32.290> taken<00:05:32.500> out<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.790> let's<00:05:33.970> see

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
those all got taken out and let's see

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.250 
those all got taken out and let's see
where<00:05:34.180> he<00:05:34.240> goes<00:05:34.300> from<00:05:34.510> going<00:05:34.870> from<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.110> back

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
where he goes from going from the back

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.210 
where he goes from going from the back
left<00:05:36.120> getting<00:05:37.120> away<00:05:37.210> from<00:05:37.330> those<00:05:37.630> mortars

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
left getting away from those mortars

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.730 
left getting away from those mortars
those<00:05:39.220> deal<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> lot<00:05:39.790> of<00:05:39.940> damage<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:41.410> Zuko's

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
those deal a lot of damage to the Zuko's

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.780 
those deal a lot of damage to the Zuko's
at<00:05:41.860> least<00:05:42.540> taking<00:05:43.540> out<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.750> base<00:05:44.790> going

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
at least taking out the base going

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.000 
at least taking out the base going
around<00:05:46.030> here<00:05:46.360> pretty<00:05:47.080> much<00:05:47.200> out<00:05:47.410> of<00:05:47.470> range<00:05:47.860> of

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
around here pretty much out of range of

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.180 
around here pretty much out of range of
everything<00:05:49.590> so<00:05:50.590> he's<00:05:50.710> taking<00:05:50.800> out<00:05:51.040> these

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
everything so he's taking out these

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.460 
everything so he's taking out these
defenses<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.730> can<00:05:51.880> hit<00:05:51.970> his<00:05:52.150> troops<00:05:52.450> and<00:05:53.350> then

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
defenses I can hit his troops and then

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.810 
defenses I can hit his troops and then
he's<00:05:53.560> going<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.740> reposition<00:05:54.220> and<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.640> should

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
he's going to reposition and that should

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.330 
he's going to reposition and that should
be<00:05:54.910> that<00:05:55.150> something<00:05:55.510> easy<00:05:55.660> win<00:05:55.900> right<00:05:55.930> there

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
be that something easy win right there

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.050 
be that something easy win right there
and<00:05:57.340> then<00:05:57.460> what's<00:05:58.300> our<00:05:58.420> last<00:05:58.480> one<00:05:59.730> then<00:06:00.730> I<00:06:00.850> all

ran out and yeah so I just had Lee had
to<00:06:20.890> make<00:06:21.040> it<00:06:21.160> back<00:06:21.280> there<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:23.040> repositioning

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
to make it back there and repositioning

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.490 
to make it back there and repositioning
to<00:06:24.190> take<00:06:24.340> out<00:06:24.490> some<00:06:24.700> of<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.820> buildings<00:06:25.500> taking

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500

to take out some of the buildings taking
out<00:06:26.590> some<00:06:26.770> stuff<00:06:27.040> and<00:06:27.400> then<00:06:27.790> I<00:06:27.880> would

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
out some stuff and then I would

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.960 
out some stuff and then I would
reposition<00:06:28.570> one<00:06:28.930> more<00:06:29.140> time<00:06:29.380> I<00:06:29.410> think<00:06:29.760> yep<00:06:30.760> and

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
reposition one more time I think yep and
