00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
day so um I guess in that regard you
could<00:01:51.840> call<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> fits<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.890> macros<00:01:52.979> but

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
could call it if it fits your macros but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
could call it if it fits your macros but
I<00:01:54.290> instead<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.850> fitting<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.060> um<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> know

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
I instead of fitting in um you know

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
I instead of fitting in um you know
chocolate<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.119> something<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
chocolate or something like that if I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
but that's not just to say that's not to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.190 
but that's not just to say that's not to
say<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.789> I'm<00:02:08.970> restricting<00:02:09.569> myself<00:02:09.750> from

ninety-five<00:02:15.030> percent<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.629> time<00:02:15.750> i'm

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
ninety-five percent of the time i'm

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.470 
ninety-five percent of the time i'm

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
those goals throughout the day I think

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.449 
those goals throughout the day I think
you<00:02:21.870> need<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.110> find<00:02:22.409> a<00:02:22.650> meal<00:02:22.799> plan<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.310> works

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
you need to find a meal plan that works

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.759 
you need to find a meal plan that works

prep for me a lot easier to make when I

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.220 
prep for me a lot easier to make when I

and what I want and what I'm what sounds

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.619 
and what I want and what I'm what sounds
good<00:03:01.019> instead<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.829> what<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.459> need<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.299> at

good instead of what I need to have at

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.920 
good instead of what I need to have at
that<00:03:03.780> moment<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.799> think<00:03:05.310> that's<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.930> much

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
that moment so I think that's a much

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.550 
that moment so I think that's a much
better<00:03:07.400> way<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.910> about<00:03:09.060> eating<00:03:10.049> for<00:03:10.410> me

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
better way of going about eating for me

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.710 
better way of going about eating for me
all<00:03:10.890> year<00:03:11.489> round<00:03:13.549> do<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.640> always<00:03:14.940> need<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.510> use

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
all year round do you always need to use

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500 
all year round do you always need to use
heavy<00:03:16.019> weights<00:03:16.319> on<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.859> day<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:18.000> light

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
heavy weights on like day or is light

exercise<00:03:20.970> okay<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.109> depend<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
exercise okay this is going to depend a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.979 
exercise okay this is going to depend a
lot<00:03:25.680> on<00:03:25.739> your<00:03:25.859> goals<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.459> mean<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:26.970> your<00:03:27.569> goals

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
lot on your goals I mean I if your goals

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.890 
lot on your goals I mean I if your goals
are<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.549> gain<00:03:29.549> muscle<00:03:29.819> then<00:03:30.329> you're<00:03:30.569> going<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
are to gain muscle then you're going to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.000 
are to gain muscle then you're going to
need<00:03:31.169> to<00:03:32.180> add<00:03:33.180> heavier<00:03:34.019> weights<00:03:34.260> you're<00:03:34.769> going

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
need to add heavier weights you're going

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.400 
need to add heavier weights you're going
to<00:03:35.099> have<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.280> challenge<00:03:35.459> yourself<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:37.079> that

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
to have to challenge yourself and that

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.170 
to have to challenge yourself and that
way<00:03:37.620> because<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.370> continue<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.000> lift

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
way because if you continue to lift

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.449 
way because if you continue to lift
lighter<00:03:39.569> with<00:03:40.019> higher<00:03:40.200> repetitions<00:03:40.889> you're

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
lighter with higher repetitions you're

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.490 
lighter with higher repetitions you're
eventually<00:03:41.639> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.150> hit<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.419> sticking<00:03:43.290> point

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
eventually going to hit a sticking point

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.920 
eventually going to hit a sticking point
and<00:03:43.799> not<00:03:44.519> really<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:45.090> much<00:03:45.239> progress<00:03:45.480> that's

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
and not really see much progress that's

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.069 
and not really see much progress that's
more<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.560> maintenance<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.079> burning

to<00:04:05.639> build<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.090> ton<00:04:06.389> of<00:04:06.419> muscle<00:04:06.930> we<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.790> add

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
to build a ton of muscle we have to add

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.240 
to build a ton of muscle we have to add
progressive<00:04:09.989> overload<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.769> need<00:04:11.099> to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
progressive overload so you need to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.789 
progressive overload so you need to
consistently<00:04:11.970> increase<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.230> weights<00:04:13.440> and

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
consistently increase the weights and

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.319 
consistently increase the weights and
decrease<00:04:14.699> repetitions<00:04:15.359> in<00:04:15.870> order<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.889> see

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
decrease repetitions in order to see

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.140 
decrease repetitions in order to see
increased<00:04:18.329> muscle<00:04:18.570> mass<00:04:18.890> if<00:04:19.890> your<00:04:20.579> goal<00:04:20.849> is<00:04:20.880> to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
increased muscle mass if your goal is to

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.480 
increased muscle mass if your goal is to
stay<00:04:21.840> where<00:04:22.019> you're<00:04:22.109> at<00:04:22.169> and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
stay where you're at and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.740 
stay where you're at and
get<00:04:23.610> any<00:04:23.729> more<00:04:24.000> muscle<00:04:24.389> than<00:04:24.740> yes<00:04:25.740> i<00:04:25.949> would<00:04:26.009> say

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
get any more muscle than yes i would say

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.390 
get any more muscle than yes i would say
lift<00:04:27.750> lighter<00:04:28.319> weights<00:04:28.979> with<00:04:29.280> high

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
lift lighter weights with high

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.339 
lift lighter weights with high
repetitions<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.539> it<00:04:30.660> really<00:04:30.720> depends<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.289> your

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
repetitions so it really depends on your

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.659 
repetitions so it really depends on your
goals<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.860> your<00:04:31.979> body<00:04:32.160> type<00:04:32.460> i<00:04:34.460> am<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669

microwave just make sure you put a cover
over<00:05:05.250> them<00:05:05.639> because<00:05:06.030> they<00:05:06.180> will<00:05:06.300> blow<00:05:06.539> up<00:05:06.750> if

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
over them because they will blow up if

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.809 
over them because they will blow up if
you<00:05:07.080> don't<00:05:07.229> stir<00:05:08.159> them<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.520> i<00:05:08.580> would<00:05:08.699> get

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
you don't stir them so i would get

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.529 
you don't stir them so i would get
liquid<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.210> white<00:05:09.449> or<00:05:10.110> regular<00:05:10.710> egg<00:05:10.800> whites<00:05:11.009> and

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
liquid I white or regular egg whites and

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.120 
liquid I white or regular egg whites and
maybe<00:05:12.539> add<00:05:12.720> one<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.139> go<00:05:13.259> in<00:05:13.500> there<00:05:13.620> for<00:05:13.919> some

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
maybe add one you go in there for some

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.700 
maybe add one you go in there for some
good<00:05:14.280> healthy<00:05:14.580> fats<00:05:14.819> and<00:05:15.150> then<00:05:15.690> watch<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.560> like

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
good healthy fats and then watch it like

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.320 
good healthy fats and then watch it like
every<00:05:16.919> 30<00:05:17.099> seconds<00:05:17.520> go<00:05:17.669> in<00:05:17.789> there<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.060> stir<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
every 30 seconds go in there and stir it

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.820 
every 30 seconds go in there and stir it
so<00:05:18.599> it<00:05:18.659> doesn't<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:19.110> pop<00:05:19.349> all<00:05:19.560> over<00:05:19.590> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
so it doesn't like pop all over the
