things<00:01:05.229> about<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.710> bugged<00:01:06.130> me<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.700> when

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880

point them out I think I may just shut
up<00:01:13.000> for<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.270> long<00:01:13.390> periods<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.840> time<00:01:14.020> though

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
up for a long periods of time though

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.620 
up for a long periods of time though
until<00:01:14.590> something<00:01:15.159> comes<00:01:15.880> up<00:01:16.150> that's<00:01:16.180> worth

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
until something comes up that's worth

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.140 
until something comes up that's worth
saying<00:01:16.900> because<00:01:17.200> really<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.760> if<00:01:18.760> you<00:01:18.909> like

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
saying because really it's if you like

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.680 
saying because really it's if you like
Castlevania<00:01:20.940> you<00:01:21.940> should<00:01:22.119> already<00:01:22.360> own<00:01:22.540> this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
Castlevania you should already own this

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:49.300 
Castlevania you should already own this
game<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.470> if<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.680> don't<00:01:24.390> fuck<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.810> bin

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.430 

so<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.270> where<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.600> starts<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.080> bug<00:01:51.229> me<00:01:51.409> a

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
so this is where it starts to bug me a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.100 
so this is where it starts to bug me a
little<00:01:51.680> bit<00:01:51.799> like<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.310> tell<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.760> that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
little bit like you can tell that that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.600 
little bit like you can tell that that
that<00:01:54.110> candle<00:01:54.560> right<00:01:54.740> there<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.580> I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
that candle right there the one that I

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.600 
that candle right there the one that I
just<00:01:55.760> hit<00:01:56.119> um<00:01:56.680> it's<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:57.799> sort<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.130> floating

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
just hit um it's just sort of floating

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.480 
just hit um it's just sort of floating
in<00:01:58.850> mid-air<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.170> bugs<00:02:00.409> me<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.890> why<00:02:01.430> is

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
in mid-air and that bugs me and why is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.240 
in mid-air and that bugs me and why is
the<00:02:01.729> staircase<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.860> like<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.070> two

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the staircase here like in two

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.340 
the staircase here like in two
dimensions<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.940> think<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:05.930> just<00:02:06.200> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
dimensions you think like it's just the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.190 
dimensions you think like it's just the
floor<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:06.950> what's<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.820> being<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.509> backdrop

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
floor but what's it being the backdrop

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800 
floor but what's it being the backdrop
being<00:02:09.440> 3d<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.759> doesn't<00:02:11.120> make<00:02:11.270> any<00:02:11.510> sense

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
being 3d it just doesn't make any sense

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.630 
being 3d it just doesn't make any sense
it's<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.650> platform<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.340> stairs

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's just a little platform with stairs

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.800 
it's just a little platform with stairs
up<00:02:13.880> there<00:02:14.090> um<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.370> that's<00:02:16.940> that's<00:02:17.390> what<00:02:17.630> bugs

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
up there um so that's that's what bugs

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.530 
up there um so that's that's what bugs
me<00:02:17.989> about<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> graphics<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.190> game<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.450> I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.070 
me about the graphics in this game and I
died<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.810> couple<00:02:21.290> times<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.769> -<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
died a couple times in this - it is a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.920

experience and dying is part of that and
this<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.650> Castlevania<00:02:34.630> like

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
feet wide it would it would look like

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:20.010 
feet wide it would it would look like
from<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.630> perspective

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.700 

so<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:22.150> does<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.420> Vita<00:03:22.600> do<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:23.770> game

so what does the Vita do for this game

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.440 
so what does the Vita do for this game
not<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.740> whole<00:03:27.100> heck<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.610> lot<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:28.090> mean<00:03:28.330> it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
not a whole heck of a lot I mean it

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.910 
not a whole heck of a lot I mean it
looks<00:03:28.660> better<00:03:28.900> obviously

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
looks better obviously

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.550 
looks better obviously
I<00:03:30.100> say<00:03:30.460> that<00:03:30.670> every<00:03:30.910> video<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:32.230> true

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
I say that every video and it's true

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.140 
I say that every video and it's true
here<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:35.340> don't<00:03:36.340> know<00:03:36.430> why<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.640> just<00:03:37.000> let

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
here the I don't know why I just let

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.820 
here the I don't know why I just let
myself<00:03:37.300> dial<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.170> think<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.710> was

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
myself dial like that I think I was

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.590 
myself dial like that I think I was
trying<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.160> do<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> special<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:39.970> not<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> special

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
trying to do a special but not a special

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.960 
trying to do a special but not a special
move<00:03:40.750> but<00:03:41.050> where<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.470> throw<00:03:41.770> your<00:03:42.040> cross<00:03:42.550> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
move but where you throw your cross and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.390 
move but where you throw your cross and
I<00:03:43.660> couldn't<00:03:44.020> figure<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.260> out<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.160> part<00:03:48.370> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
I couldn't figure it out this is part of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.920 
I couldn't figure it out this is part of
the<00:03:48.490> reason<00:03:48.610> why<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:48.940> cool<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.360> it's<00:03:49.510> 2.5

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the reason why it's cool that it's 2.5

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.150 
the reason why it's cool that it's 2.5
DS<00:03:50.680> because<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.460> can<00:03:51.730> show<00:03:51.940> stuff<00:03:52.240> like<00:03:52.470> that

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.380 

anyway<00:03:58.580> graphics<00:03:59.580> look<00:03:59.700> better<00:03:59.940> but<00:04:00.150> there's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
anyway graphics look better but there's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.700 
anyway graphics look better but there's
no<00:04:00.510> use<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.990> second<00:04:01.320> stick<00:04:01.530> obviously

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
no use for the second stick obviously

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.300 
no use for the second stick obviously
