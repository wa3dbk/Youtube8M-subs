00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.280
 In this video I will show you 3 ideas to decorate with chocolate 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.880
 some cakes for Hallowen 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
 For our first cake we will melt 75g of milk chocolate 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
 and 25 g of dark chocolate 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.600
 We are using a mold of about 22 cm 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 Once we have it melted, we let it temper 3 or 4 minutes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 and we pour it over our mold 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.200
 In this case we do it before removing the hoop 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 Pour the chocolate 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 and we are turning the cake so that it is distributed well 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.880
 We could help from a spoon or a spatula 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.720
 Now let's make the decoration with 50 g of white chocolate 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 that we have melted in the bain marie 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.040
 As you can see I am using a bag of those used for frozen 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 to which I have cut the tip 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.520
 We are making some arches with a distance of 2-3 cm between them 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 and with the help of a toothpick or toothpick 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 from the smallest circle 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.720
 let's make a line joining the white lines 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.160
 in this way we will have our spider web ready 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.400
 And now using a Gothic typeface 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 we put the name ... 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.320
 Halloween 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.680
 And if you like it, you could also make a drawing of a spider 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.440
 the one that was in this cake has already left :-) 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 You see that it looks cool and it has been very, very simple 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.360
 I made this second decoration on a pumpkin pie, 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.440
 you have the link at the top of the video 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.960
 I have melted in a bain-marie 100 g of white chocolate 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 We have taken advantage of the outside 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960
 to make the pumpkin shape ... 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 some eyes with a bad face ... 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 and a scary smile 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.320
 You see: simple, simple 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.440
 And now we go with the final apotheosis 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 let's do it based on a sponge cake 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 about 20-22 cm 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.120
 Before starting we put the cake on a grid 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.720
 with a fountain below to collect the chocolate that is left over 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.920
 We have melted 100 g of milk chocolate in a bain-marie 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 we've let it temper a bit 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.760
 and with the help of a spoon we begin the decoration 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760
 We bathe the edge with chocolate 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.760
 we let it fall little by little 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.120
 and with a toothpick we will make the edge as if it were boiling 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.520
 We melted 70 g of dark chocolate 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480
 we put it in a pastry bag or a bag 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.920
 we cut the very finite tip 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.680
 We start doing the outline ... 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 head... 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 the eyes... 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.800
 and we are filling everything with chocolate 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.120
 Let's make the tail ... 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.480
 first fine and then we fill it a little more 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 two points that will make eyes ... 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.920
 here we will make some bats ... 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.040
 one... 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.120
 here another ... 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.280
 and here we are going to make another 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.960
 Now we draw the missing leg, 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.360
 we are not going to leave him lame 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.360
 we leave it unfilled 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 and with the help of a toothpick we make mustaches 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 and we prepare the details of the head 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 we will do it by dipping the stick in the milk chocolate 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 we draw the shape of the ear ... 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600
 fill the inside ... 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 nose... 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.360
 and the rest of the contour of the face 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.280
 and now we fill the other leg 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.640
 Since we are at Halloween we are going to scare him ... 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 let's make your hair stand on end 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.600
 We finished the details of the eyes ... 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.920
 we enlarge the pupils a little ... 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.520
 Retouch the ears 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.760
 to make them pointy 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.920
 We go with the bats ... 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.320
 we make the tips of the wings 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320
 and the antennas (ears) 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.320
 we go with the other ... 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
 we make the tips of the wings ... 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.320
 The lower part... 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 and we retouched the last 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.800
 We prepare the legs 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 covering the front legs ... 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.280
 and we make the hooves with the dark chocolate 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 we extended them a little 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.280
 and fill 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.600
 Finally we do some details in the field 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.120
 with black chocolate we are making some herbs 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.200
 a line here, another there ... and here is 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.960
 That has been cool ... 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840
 It's simple... 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.200
 Let's take a picture and follow it and go ahead ... 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.200
 You see that with a little chocolate and a toothpick 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680
 You can do wonders ... 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.760
 And this has been all ... thank you very much for watching the video ... 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.640
