00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
going to pull out all of the calcium

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.440 
going to pull out all of the calcium
from<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> bones<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:20.040> well<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.550> potassium<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
from the bones as well as potassium and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.580 
from the bones as well as potassium and
magnesium<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.640> put<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.209> bones<00:02:24.570> into<00:02:25.380> our

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
magnesium so we put the bones into our

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.290 
magnesium so we put the bones into our
stock<00:02:25.980> pot<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.090> we're<00:02:33.090> going

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
stock pot just like that and we're going

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.040 
stock pot just like that and we're going
to<00:02:33.420> add<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:34.140> half<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.190> cup<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.610> vinegar<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to add a half a cup of vinegar and the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.960 
to add a half a cup of vinegar and the
reason<00:02:37.470> we're<00:02:37.620> adding<00:02:37.980> vinegar<00:02:38.130> I'm<00:02:38.550> going<00:02:38.880> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
reason we're adding vinegar I'm going to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.360 
reason we're adding vinegar I'm going to
add<00:02:39.120> organic<00:02:39.450> apple<00:02:40.140> cider<00:02:40.350> vinegar<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.130> can

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
add organic apple cider vinegar you can

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
add organic apple cider vinegar you can
add<00:02:41.700> white<00:02:42.000> vinegar<00:02:42.300> or<00:02:42.540> another<00:02:43.140> vinegar

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
add white vinegar or another vinegar

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.400 
add white vinegar or another vinegar
that<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:43.980> very<00:02:44.220> strong<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.790> flavor<00:02:45.200> but<00:02:46.200> we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
that is not very strong in flavor but we

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.030 
that is not very strong in flavor but we
will<00:02:46.620> add<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> half<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> cup<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.700> vinegar<00:02:49.040> just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
will add a half a cup of vinegar just

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.690 
will add a half a cup of vinegar just
pour<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> bones<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
pour it right in on the bones and the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.400 
pour it right in on the bones and the
reason<00:02:54.090> we're<00:02:54.209> adding<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> vinegar<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
reason we're adding the vinegar is that

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.400 
reason we're adding the vinegar is that
the<00:02:55.560> vinegar<00:02:55.950> will<00:02:56.130> help<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.580> draw<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.299> all<00:02:57.810> of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the vinegar will help to draw out all of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.690 
the vinegar will help to draw out all of
the<00:02:58.650> minerals<00:02:59.070> from<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.580> bones<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:02.549> will

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
the minerals from the bones and you will

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.250 
the minerals from the bones and you will
see<00:03:02.880> evidence<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.810> when<00:03:04.769> your<00:03:05.190> stock<00:03:05.549> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
see evidence of that when your stock is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.350 
see evidence of that when your stock is
finished<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.560> you'll<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.950> actual<00:03:08.519> lines<00:03:08.850> and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
finished and you'll see actual lines and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.570 
finished and you'll see actual lines and
the<00:03:09.420> bones<00:03:09.660> from<00:03:10.590> where<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.400> this

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the bones from where all of this

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.660 
the bones from where all of this
wonderful<00:03:12.390> calcium<00:03:13.080> was<00:03:13.230> drawn<00:03:13.590> out<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.519> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
wonderful calcium was drawn out so the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.490 
wonderful calcium was drawn out so the
next<00:03:14.880> thing<00:03:15.120> we<00:03:15.239> need<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.540> pure<00:03:15.870> water

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
next thing we need is pure water

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.130 
next thing we need is pure water
I<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:17.160> filtered<00:03:17.640> water<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.570> we're

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
I have filtered water here and we're

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.289 
I have filtered water here and we're
going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.500> ahead<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.100> add<00:03:20.519> filtered<00:03:21.090> water

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
going to go ahead and add filtered water

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.650 
going to go ahead and add filtered water
to<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.530> stock<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.610> need<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> add<00:03:24.000> four<00:03:24.269> quarts

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
to the stock you need to add four quarts

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.520 
to the stock you need to add four quarts
of<00:03:24.750> water<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.799> pot

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.750 

one<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.709> things<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.099> want<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.310> make<00:03:33.370> sure

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
one of the things you want to make sure

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520 
one of the things you want to make sure
is<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.180> your<00:03:34.450> bones<00:03:34.719> are<00:03:34.959> covered<00:03:35.319> with

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
is that your bones are covered with

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.170 
is that your bones are covered with
water<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.579> need<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.760> add<00:03:36.939> a<00:03:36.969> little

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
water so if you need to add a little

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.160 
water so if you need to add a little
more<00:03:37.329> water<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:37.719> go<00:03:37.840> ahead<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.140> do<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
more water and go ahead and do that

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.780 
more water and go ahead and do that
there<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.200> go<00:03:41.500> good<00:03:41.769> shot<00:03:41.980> all<00:03:42.519> you're

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
there you go good shot all you're

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.170 
there you go good shot all you're
looking<00:03:42.909> at<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:44.069> bony<00:03:45.069> bones<00:03:45.400> water<00:03:45.909> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
looking at is bony bones water and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.759 
looking at is bony bones water and
vinegar<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.689> the<00:03:46.810> vinegar<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.230> going<00:03:47.469> to<00:03:47.560> act

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
vinegar and the vinegar is going to act

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.890 
vinegar and the vinegar is going to act
on<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.219> bones<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.760> draw<00:03:49.060> out<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.299> nutrients

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
on the bones to draw out the nutrients

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.270 
on the bones to draw out the nutrients
from<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> bones<00:03:50.409> and<00:03:50.620> help<00:03:50.799> us<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.129> have<00:03:51.219> a

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
from the bones and help us to have a

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.059 
from the bones and help us to have a
very<00:03:51.549> gelatinous<00:03:52.239> stock<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:53.379> gelatin<00:03:53.920> is

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
very gelatinous stock the gelatin is

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.369 
very gelatinous stock the gelatin is
important<00:03:54.639> because<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.359> aids<00:03:55.569> in<00:03:55.810> digestion

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
important because it aids in digestion

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.690 
important because it aids in digestion
and<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.819> also<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.420> important<00:03:58.900> because<00:03:59.769> it

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
and it also is important because it

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.360 
and it also is important because it
becomes<00:04:01.180> what<00:04:01.450> we<00:04:01.480> call<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.750> protein<00:04:02.409> sparer

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
becomes what we call a protein sparer

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.490 
becomes what we call a protein sparer
which<00:04:04.209> means<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.870> will<00:04:04.989> not<00:04:05.139> have<00:04:05.379> to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
which means that you will not have to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
which means that you will not have to
eat<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:05.859> much<00:04:06.129> meat<00:04:06.849> protein<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:08.409> you<00:04:08.680> have

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
eat as much meat protein if you have

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.940 
eat as much meat protein if you have
stock<00:04:10.180> as<00:04:10.510> part<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:10.959> what<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.439> every<00:04:11.769> day

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
stock as part of what you have every day
