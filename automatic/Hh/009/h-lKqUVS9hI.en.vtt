he's his fire-type moves are not very

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
he's his fire-type moves are not very
effective<00:01:31.850> although<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.420> fire<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
effective although here on fire and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
effective although here on fire and
there<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> new<00:01:34.590> addition<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> game

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
there is a new addition to the game

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
there is a new addition to the game
which<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> original<00:01:37.409> blue<00:01:37.650> or

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
which was not in the original blue or

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.289 
which was not in the original blue or
red<00:01:37.950> version<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.790> green<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.479> played<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
red version or green if you played that

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
red version or green if you played that
so<00:01:42.299> yeah<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.229> makes<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:44.070> easier<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so yeah it makes it a lot easier but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.620 
so yeah it makes it a lot easier but
still<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.710> gonna<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.130> harder<00:01:47.549> than<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
still it is gonna be harder than all the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.550 
still it is gonna be harder than all the
others<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.220> level<00:01:51.149> 13<00:01:51.689> Charmander<00:01:52.259> learns

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
others so a level 13 Charmander learns

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280 
others so a level 13 Charmander learns
metal<00:01:52.950> claw<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> metal<00:01:54.299> claw<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.689> unique<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
metal claw and metal claw it's unique to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
metal claw and metal claw it's unique to
fire<00:01:55.710> red<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
fire red because it was not in the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
fire red because it was not in the
original<00:01:57.299> red<00:01:57.810> version<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.439> blue<00:01:58.680> version<00:01:59.009> as

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
original red version or blue version as

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.080 
original red version or blue version as
you<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.790> know<00:02:00.110> probably<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.219> no<00:02:02.759> steel

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you all know probably there was no steel

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.719 
you all know probably there was no steel
type<00:02:03.420> Pokemon<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.259> therefore<00:02:05.009> no<00:02:05.219> steel-type

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
type Pokemon and therefore no steel-type

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.650 
type Pokemon and therefore no steel-type
moves<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.229> made<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> even<00:02:07.910> like<00:02:08.910> 10<00:02:09.360> times

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
harder to start off with Charmander and

level 13 and steel moves are gonna help

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.300

you<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> ton<00:02:19.910> here<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.840> go<00:02:21.140> ahead<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.350> use<00:02:22.010> metal

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you a ton here so go ahead and use metal

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.760 
you a ton here so go ahead and use metal
club<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:22.910> Charmander<00:02:23.660> it's<00:02:24.500> gonna<00:02:24.620> be

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
club you have Charmander it's gonna be

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.830 
club you have Charmander it's gonna be
super<00:02:24.980> effective<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.910> still<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> pretty<00:02:26.630> weak

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
super effective it's still a pretty weak

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080 
super effective it's still a pretty weak
move<00:02:27.110> however<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.220> doesn't<00:02:28.580> help<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.910> like

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
move however so it doesn't help you like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.160 
move however so it doesn't help you like
a<00:02:29.300> ton<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.820> I'll<00:02:31.940> do<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.300> comparison<00:02:32.990> here

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
a ton so I'll do like a comparison here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.130 
a ton so I'll do like a comparison here
like<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.709> use<00:02:33.830> Ember<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:35.330> very<00:02:35.600> effective

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
like if you use Ember not very effective

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.370 
like if you use Ember not very effective
but<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.950> still<00:02:37.250> does<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.459> pretty<00:02:37.730> decent<00:02:38.120> chunk

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
but it still does a pretty decent chunk

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.830 
but it still does a pretty decent chunk
compared<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:40.310> move<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:41.420> super

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
compared to a move that's super

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.270 
compared to a move that's super
effective<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.239> yeah<00:02:44.660> but<00:02:45.590> yeah<00:02:45.770> metal<00:02:45.980> cloth

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
effective so yeah but yeah metal cloth

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.860 
effective so yeah but yeah metal cloth
still<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> little<00:02:47.000> bit<00:02:47.180> better<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.690> we'll<00:02:47.780> go

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
still a little bit better so we'll go

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.199 
still a little bit better so we'll go
ahead<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.050> use<00:02:48.140> metal<00:02:48.500> claw<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:49.550> would

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
ahead and use metal claw I would

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.280 
ahead and use metal claw I would
recommend<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.900> start<00:02:51.140> off<00:02:51.230> with

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
recommend if you start off with

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.500 
recommend if you start off with
Charmander<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.100> at<00:02:52.220> least<00:02:52.400> level<00:02:52.580> 14

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.229 

because<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.470> gym<00:02:58.280> battle<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
because this is a gym battle and the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.490 
because this is a gym battle and the
Pokemon<00:02:59.630> are<00:02:59.750> giving<00:02:59.959> me<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> little<00:03:00.380> bit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
Pokemon are giving me a little bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.380 
Pokemon are giving me a little bit
higher<00:03:00.709> level<00:03:00.739> than<00:03:01.370> anything<00:03:01.850> you've<00:03:02.180> seen

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
higher level than anything you've seen

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.430 
higher level than anything you've seen
thus<00:03:02.690> far<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:04.480> Sandshrew<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:08.200> ground<00:03:09.200> type

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
thus far so Sandshrew is a ground type

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.229 
thus far so Sandshrew is a ground type
so<00:03:10.310> he's<00:03:10.610> not<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.790> rock<00:03:10.970> type<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:13.790> ground

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
so he's not a rock type and on ground

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.060 
so he's not a rock type and on ground
type<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.630> can<00:03:14.780> use<00:03:14.930> Ember<00:03:15.380> because<00:03:15.769> it's<00:03:15.920> not

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
type you can use Ember because it's not

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.580 
type you can use Ember because it's not
gonna<00:03:16.190> be<00:03:16.340> not<00:03:16.580> very<00:03:16.790> effective<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:18.110> yeah<00:03:18.410> go

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
gonna be not very effective so yeah go

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.979 
gonna be not very effective so yeah go
ahead<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.769> use<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.989> that

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
ahead and use that on that and that

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.590 
ahead and use that on that and that
takes<00:03:21.350> care<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.220> pre<00:03:22.519> battle<00:03:22.910> usually<00:03:23.510> in

and get started on him the first step on

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.750 
and get started on him the first step on
his<00:04:09.630> list<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:09.959> Geodude<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.340> started<00:04:11.610> off

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
his list is Geodude if you started off

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.840 
his list is Geodude if you started off
with<00:04:11.790> Bulbasaur<00:04:12.269> or<00:04:12.750> any<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.830> ore<00:04:14.430> or

with Bulbasaur or any of the ore or
squirtle<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:16.470> gonna<00:04:16.590> be<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.769> breeze

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
squirtle it's gonna be a breeze

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.680 
squirtle it's gonna be a breeze
so<00:04:17.549> there's<00:04:17.730> not<00:04:17.820> much<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.150> challenge<00:04:18.510> there

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
so there's not much of a challenge there

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
so there's not much of a challenge there
but<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:19.859> with<00:04:19.980> Charmander<00:04:20.340> there's<00:04:21.000> a

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
which is a steel type at level 13 so

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.420 
which is a steel type at level 13 so
that's<00:04:45.990> actually<00:04:46.169> going<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.500> be<00:04:46.650> pretty

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
that's actually going to be pretty

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.719 
that's actually going to be pretty
useful<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:49.440> super<00:04:49.979> effective<00:04:50.430> against

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
useful it is super effective against

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.870 
useful it is super effective against
rock<00:04:50.970> pokémon<00:04:51.180> which<00:04:51.979> makes<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> lot<00:04:53.610> easier

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
rock pokémon which makes it a lot easier

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
rock pokémon which makes it a lot easier

that<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:01.560> was<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:02.270> nightmare<00:05:03.270> trying<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:03.990> him

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
that it was a nightmare trying to be him

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.420 
that it was a nightmare trying to be him
with<00:05:04.560> Charmander<00:05:06.950> compared<00:05:07.950> to<00:05:08.040> how<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.250> is

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
with Charmander compared to how it is

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.020 
with Charmander compared to how it is
now<00:05:08.540> with<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:10.229> steel<00:05:10.470> type<00:05:10.710> move<00:05:10.919> metal<00:05:11.729> clock

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
now with the steel type move metal clock

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.560 
now with the steel type move metal clock
it<00:05:12.750> makes<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.169> lot<00:05:13.320> easier<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.240> next<00:05:15.240> up<00:05:15.419> on

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
it makes it a lot easier so next up on

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
had the chance so yeah honest pretty

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.630 
had the chance so yeah honest pretty
cool<00:05:30.510> he<00:05:30.720> evolved<00:05:31.050> into<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:33.980> into<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.130> steel<00:05:35.370> type

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
which is d Lakes and be careful with

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.980 
which is d Lakes and be careful with
onyx<00:05:38.790> I'd<00:05:39.030> already<00:05:39.180> beat<00:05:39.480> him<00:05:39.570> pretty<00:05:39.750> quickly

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
onyx I'd already beat him pretty quickly

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.270 
onyx I'd already beat him pretty quickly
but<00:05:40.260> be<00:05:41.220> careful<00:05:41.550> with<00:05:41.640> onyx<00:05:42.000> because<00:05:42.240> he<00:05:42.840> will

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
but be careful with onyx because he will

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.040 
but be careful with onyx because he will
use<00:05:44.280> Rock<00:05:44.580> tomb<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:45.090> that's<00:05:45.390> super<00:05:45.660> effective

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
use Rock tomb and that's super effective

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.140 
use Rock tomb and that's super effective
against<00:05:46.320> Charmander<00:05:46.830> he<00:05:47.550> didn't<00:05:47.790> get<00:05:47.880> to<00:05:48.000> use

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
against Charmander he didn't get to use

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.810 
against Charmander he didn't get to use
it<00:05:48.300> there<00:05:48.480> cuz<00:05:48.690> I<00:05:48.780> dare<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.110> head<00:05:49.500> ko<00:05:49.710> with<00:05:50.460> that

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
it there cuz I dare to head ko with that

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.580 
it there cuz I dare to head ko with that
steel<00:05:51.150> type<00:05:51.390> move<00:05:51.600> which<00:05:51.960> made<00:05:52.170> it<00:05:52.290> a<00:05:52.350> breeze

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
steel type move which made it a breeze

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.470 
steel type move which made it a breeze
but<00:05:53.130> yeah<00:05:53.250> be<00:05:53.400> careful<00:05:53.550> with<00:05:53.790> rock<00:05:54.000> tune<00:05:54.240> if

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
but yeah be careful with rock tune if

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.100 
but yeah be careful with rock tune if
you<00:05:54.630> have<00:05:54.810> Charmander<00:05:55.410> and<00:05:56.810> as<00:05:57.810> you<00:05:57.960> can<00:05:58.050> see

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
you have Charmander and as you can see

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.300 
you have Charmander and as you can see
he's<00:05:58.380> not<00:05:58.440> too<00:05:58.830> hard

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
he's not too hard

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.790 
he's not too hard
he's<00:06:00.240> actually<00:06:00.660> pretty<00:06:00.960> easy<00:06:01.080> with

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
he's actually pretty easy with

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.230 
he's actually pretty easy with
Charmander<00:06:02.100> now<00:06:02.430> that<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:02.730> have<00:06:02.850> that<00:06:02.880> steel

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
Charmander now that you have that steel

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.600 
Charmander now that you have that steel
type<00:06:03.480> move<00:06:03.690> compared<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.470> how<00:06:04.590> he<00:06:04.740> was<00:06:04.890> on<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
type move compared to how he was on the

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.880 
type move compared to how he was on the
original<00:06:05.700> games<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:07.170> that's<00:06:07.500> how<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:07.680> beat

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
original games so that's how you beat

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.800 
original games so that's how you beat
him<00:06:09.050> it'll<00:06:10.050> be<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.140> lot<00:06:10.380> easier<00:06:11.030> with<00:06:12.030> squirtle

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
him it'll be a lot easier with squirtle

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.900 
him it'll be a lot easier with squirtle
or<00:06:12.990> Bulbasaur<00:06:13.500> like<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:13.920> hundred<00:06:14.490> times<00:06:14.640> easier

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
or Bulbasaur like a hundred times easier

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.330 
or Bulbasaur like a hundred times easier
but<00:06:15.420> yeah<00:06:15.750> so<00:06:16.350> then<00:06:16.530> once<00:06:16.770> you<00:06:16.830> beat<00:06:17.010> him<00:06:17.220> he

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
but yeah so then once you beat him he

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.940 
but yeah so then once you beat him he
gives<00:06:17.460> you<00:06:17.640> the<00:06:17.760> boulder<00:06:18.630> league<00:06:18.990> or<00:06:19.230> the

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
gives you the boulder league or the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.130 
gives you the boulder league or the
boulder<00:06:20.400> badge<00:06:20.690> for<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.810> Pokemon<00:06:22.170> League<00:06:22.200> and

boulder badge for the Pokemon League and

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.840 
boulder badge for the Pokemon League and
it<00:06:25.140> just<00:06:25.320> makes<00:06:25.470> it<00:06:25.590> Pokemon<00:06:26.010> more<00:06:26.220> powerful

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
it just makes it Pokemon more powerful

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.820 
it just makes it Pokemon more powerful
and<00:06:27.120> it<00:06:27.360> allows<00:06:27.720> you<00:06:27.900> to<00:06:27.960> use<00:06:28.080> flash<00:06:28.440> outside

and it allows you to use flash outside

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.080 
and it allows you to use flash outside
of<00:06:29.220> that<00:06:30.920> which<00:06:31.920> you<00:06:32.130> actually<00:06:32.280> for<00:06:32.670> need<00:06:33.000> to

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
of that which you actually for need to

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.220 
probably teach it to a Geodude later on
and<00:07:32.000> so<00:07:33.000> that<00:07:33.270> concludes<00:07:33.390> that<00:07:33.720> part<00:07:34.050> that's

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
and so that concludes that part that's

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.490 
and so that concludes that part that's
how<00:07:34.380> you<00:07:34.440> beat<00:07:34.620> Brock<00:07:35.510> he's<00:07:36.510> not<00:07:36.690> too<00:07:36.870> hard<00:07:37.200> it

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
how you beat Brock he's not too hard it

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.830 
how you beat Brock he's not too hard it
shouldn't<00:07:37.740> be<00:07:37.800> too<00:07:37.980> difficult<00:07:38.010> and<00:07:38.840> therefore

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
shouldn't be too difficult and therefore

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.360 
shouldn't be too difficult and therefore
that<00:07:40.110> concludes<00:07:40.530> this<00:07:40.680> part<00:07:40.860> of<00:07:40.980> video<00:07:41.100> in<00:07:41.280> the
