00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.370
 good after the buzz with the new 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.130
 crossover the compact 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.490
 now you can start checking if the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 bets are being realized hiv 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.880
 was the first to arrive and it seems that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 did well 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.260
 Is this not required gomes yes now with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.130
 all new compact crossovers 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.410
 officially in stores 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.230
 hr see this here was the first to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.510
 get this new cam already celebrate good 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 sales success around here so today 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 We brought him to give a check. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.410
 up close and see if it's really worth your 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410
 investment 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 just to remember the hiv joined in his 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 recipe engine 1.8 civic a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.750
 versatility of the fit and the face of the cr 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.050
 to create your new compact crossover 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.480
 and visually the result was very 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.899
 good with a drawing full of links and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.240
 portent but in the measure and even 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.029
 out shows concern with details 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.090
 like the hidden door knob 

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.090
 rear 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 inside it gives the good impression that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 all round models have as 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 careful finishing with details on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 fabric and synthetic leather 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 but since everything is dark at the same time 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.759
 a certain degree of coldness 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.759
 I really like 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.100
 but here's another good point 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.560
 interesting for those who like to lend 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.299
 attention to these more exclusive details 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.240
 this central console here for example 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.549
 which is high is very nice it divides the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 cabin as if it were a cockpit but has 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.729
 a weakness 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 the auxiliary inputs of the sound system 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.470
 well back here in a good condition 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.619
 uncomfortable when you want to connect the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.619
 cables 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.590
 anyway you can not comment on hr 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.100
 is well equipped since the first version 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.350
 but leaves out some very common items 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.070
 no models with this proposal and price 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 here there simply is not the option of 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.960
 sunroof automatic ignition of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.330
 headlights or interior mirror 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.330
 electrochromic to give some examples 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.640
 but going back to strengths is fair 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.980
 has great space and lots of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.530
 versatility with the possibility of 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.350
 banks as in the case of the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.620
 good fit but then comes that question is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.780
 How do you look at this? 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.690
 authentic where it walks very soft 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.580
 very quiet but at the same time it is a 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.590
 car pretty sure enough 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.230
 so even when you're just a little 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.000
 in curved situations here what is 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.280
 compliment also that you have a great time 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.660
 attach the steering wheel that reminds 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.880
 we have in civilian 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.920
 now and for height and not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.590
 Expect a breathtaking performance here 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.590
 but the 1.8 engine responds well enough 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.940
 agility for himself using the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.940
 cvt type transmission 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.040
 the situation is no better than in the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.370
 resumed when you accelerate hard 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.160
 because the swivel rises too fast the engine 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.270
 snores loudly and breaks the silence to the point 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.030
 to bother 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.130
 in compensation the engine revenue and 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.190
 transmits good numbers of 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.180
 consumption, which in the end is 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.580
 important 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.140
 proof of this is the note aaa in 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.140
 inmetro classification 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.920
 to end is true that the time hr 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.570
 It was very strong here in Brazil and it's 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.489
 fair to say that he has a very 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.070
 well-matched that brings beauty and 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.320
 modernity, this justifies this 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.490
 sales success but also can not 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.680
 forget that he has great 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.120
 competitors and with a detail that can 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.150
 very well to meet those who 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.390
 bother with items that hrv have not yet 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.390
 has
