00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.529
 and on stage pro is ready to leave Nastya and 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.570
 Garrosh will tell the Church and thought about going to pass 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.570
 Jews have found their bad 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:20.510
 I once fell in love with dance 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:23.170
 music and nothing to understand that without it I 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.170
 I can not live 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.699
 father said why do you need all this 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.690
 everything is not for you you have no talent 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.239
 I have a bad figure I have no appearance 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.420
 for the stage 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.350
 I perceived every word see us 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.050
 left crying I worked out even with 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.470
 childhood complex that i can never 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.840
 achieve nothing 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.370
 it seems to me that I dance the worst of all 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 that I can't do it all 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 laugh at me that's so 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.260
 psychologically it was all laid down that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 despite the fact that I occupy the first 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 place on the championship there is equal go out and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 I say that they just pity me 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.050
 regretted 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.050
 and it proved nothing 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.789
 it was not a shame even to invite parents 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.229
 on their performance and they saw me 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.990
 I dance only on the show itself 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.130
 grandfather did not believe that it was me he started 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.689
 cry and accordingly I look at 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.659
 I start to cry myself 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.020
 and starts crying grandma connects 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.289
 all its just sitting we cry just 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.289
 So 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.270
 through the tears through the pain I still 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.120
 continued to go to her dream talking 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.640
 you dates with us 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.640
 I want to do what I like 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.680
 do something that is really expensive for 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.680
 it all depends on us 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.090
 no talent 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:17.120
 and somehow on for such music is very 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.800
 aggressively doing all this to the topic itself 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.800
 maybe nothing wrong with the contrast 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.030
 at 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.860
 you have come a long and difficult way say 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.690
 please now you believe in yours 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:41.120
 power 100 percent that is something 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.280
 if you try hard 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.680
 need to achieve everything 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.050
 independence from telling you that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.050
 you don't have it all depends on you
