know this like window light is too harsh

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
know this like window light is too harsh
for<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.890> video<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.239> feel<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
for the video I kind of feel that it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.270 
for the video I kind of feel that it
adds<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.530> bit<00:00:34.649> more<00:00:34.860> light<00:00:35.100> in

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
adds just a little bit more light in

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.370 
adds just a little bit more light in
here<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.630> y'all<00:00:36.780> feel<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.200> too

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
here but if y'all feel like it's too

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.310 
here but if y'all feel like it's too
much<00:00:37.410> light<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.059> I'll<00:00:39.059> stop<00:00:39.300> using<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
much light then I'll stop using the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
much light then I'll stop using the
window<00:00:40.530> alright<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.700> looking<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
window alright so just looking at the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.190 
window alright so just looking at the
twist<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:44.930> there<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:47.059> subtle<00:00:48.059> difference

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
twist out there is a subtle difference

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.560 
twist out there is a subtle difference
between<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.739> halves<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.399> hair<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
between the two halves of my hair and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.069 
between the two halves of my hair and
I'm<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.230> quickly

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
I'm just going to go through quickly

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
I'm just going to go through quickly
again<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> side<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> kinky<00:00:57.059> curly

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
again this side here is kinky curly

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270 
again this side here is kinky curly
curling<00:00:57.420> custard<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> Shea

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
curling custard and this is the Shea

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
curling custard and this is the Shea
Moisture<00:00:59.660> curling<00:01:00.660> souffle<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.510> look

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
Moisture curling souffle so if you look

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
Moisture curling souffle so if you look
on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> kinky<00:01:04.379> curly<00:01:04.589> side<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.400> looks<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.909> tad

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
on the kinky curly side it looks a tad

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.190 
on the kinky curly side it looks a tad
bit<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.430> frizzed<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.600> less<00:01:10.470> defined<00:01:10.880> as

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
bit more frizzed out and less defined as

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
bit more frizzed out and less defined as
opposed<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> curling<00:01:13.830> souffle<00:01:14.310> side<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
opposed to the curling souffle side it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630 
opposed to the curling souffle side it
actually<00:01:15.600> held<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> definition<00:01:17.040> pretty<00:01:17.369> well

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
actually held the definition pretty well

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.990 
actually held the definition pretty well
I'm<00:01:17.850> surprised<00:01:18.860> with<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.340> glycerin

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
I'm surprised with all that glycerin

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'm surprised with all that glycerin
concept<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.450> yeah<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.750> definitely<00:01:24.930> see

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
concept so yeah you can definitely see

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
concept so yeah you can definitely see
the<00:01:25.740> difference<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.479> hoping<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the difference and then I'm hoping you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.950 
the difference and then I'm hoping you
can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.650> showing<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> our<00:01:29.250> camera

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
can see it that is showing up our camera

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.420 
can see it that is showing up our camera
my<00:01:30.960> hair<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.130> side<00:01:32.189> feels<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.560> soft

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
my hair on this side feels so so soft

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.380 
my hair on this side feels so so soft
and<00:01:36.140> moisturize<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.740> side<00:01:38.009> however<00:01:38.390> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and moisturize this side however it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.840 
and moisturize this side however it
feels<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.500> doesn't<00:01:40.979> feel<00:01:41.130> completely<00:01:41.520> dried

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
feels it doesn't feel completely dried

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
feels it doesn't feel completely dried
out<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> feels<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:42.990> mists

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
out but it feels like it's in the mists

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.179 
out but it feels like it's in the mists
of<00:01:43.320> drying<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:45.540> doesn't<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:45.990> bad<00:01:46.740> or

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of drying out like it doesn't go bad or

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
of drying out like it doesn't go bad or
completely<00:01:47.790> dry<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.390> feels<00:01:48.540> like

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
completely dry but it just feels like

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
completely dry but it just feels like
it's<00:01:49.170> getting<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> stairs<00:01:52.130> so

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it's getting there in a stairs so

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
it's getting there in a stairs so
another<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.360> I've<00:01:54.509> noticed<00:01:54.860> with<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
another thing I've noticed with the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.600 
another thing I've noticed with the
curling<00:01:56.399> souffle<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.950> adds<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.579> of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
curling souffle is that it adds a bit of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.959 
curling souffle is that it adds a bit of
weight<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.329> hair<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.340> actually

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
weight to my hair and it's actually

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.870 
weight to my hair and it's actually
causing<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.810> twist<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.860> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.189> fall<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
causing the twist out to kind of fall in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.389 
causing the twist out to kind of fall in
a<00:02:06.030> downward<00:02:06.479> direction<00:02:07.069> because<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
a downward direction because of the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.180 
a downward direction because of the
weight<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.970> opposed<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> Katy<00:02:09.959> curly<00:02:10.470> my

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
weight as opposed to the Katy curly my

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.080 
weight as opposed to the Katy curly my
hair<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.640> seems<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.420> more

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
hair just seems a little bit more

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.190 
hair just seems a little bit more
fraid<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:14.920> really<00:02:15.220> pulling<00:02:16.200> or

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
fraid and it's not really pulling or

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.540 
fraid and it's not really pulling or
weigh<00:02:17.560> my<00:02:17.860> hair<00:02:17.890> down<00:02:18.099> as<00:02:18.489> much<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:21.430> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
weigh my hair down as much so it's a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.920 
weigh my hair down as much so it's a
subtle<00:02:21.790> difference<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.450> hopefully<00:02:22.840> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
subtle difference in that hopefully you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.550 
subtle difference in that hopefully you
can<00:02:23.050> see<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.750> think<00:02:26.019> that's<00:02:26.200> something

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
can see that so I think that's something

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.509 
can see that so I think that's something
important<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.760> very<00:02:28.750> limp<00:02:29.519> fine

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
important if you have very limp fine

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.360 
important if you have very limp fine
hair<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.840> curling<00:02:32.230> souffle<00:02:32.799> may<00:02:33.099> actually

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
hair the curling souffle may actually

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 
hair the curling souffle may actually
add<00:02:33.760> too<00:02:34.239> much<00:02:34.390> weight<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:34.750> your<00:02:34.900> hair<00:02:35.049> and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
add too much weight to your hair and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.410 
add too much weight to your hair and
make<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.349> look<00:02:35.470> real<00:02:35.769> stringy<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:37.150> real

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
make it look real stringy and just real

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.690 
make it look real stringy and just real
limp<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.709> because<00:02:38.980> my<00:02:39.129> hair<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.370> rather

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
limp so but because my hair is rather

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.210 
limp so but because my hair is rather
thick<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.569> coarse

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
thick and coarse

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.550 
thick and coarse
I<00:02:42.220> actually<00:02:42.879> like<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.420> weight<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.200> asks

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560

my hair the stickiness of the curls to
play<00:02:47.440> has<00:02:47.769> kind<00:02:48.069> of<00:02:48.420> dissipated<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.569> well<00:02:49.840> it's

twist<00:04:26.430> outs<00:04:26.670> clearly<00:04:27.600> there<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.350> difference

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
twist outs clearly there is a difference

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.780 
twist outs clearly there is a difference
so<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:31.050> had<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.320> ask<00:04:31.470> me<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.950> would<00:04:32.520> prefer

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
so if you had to ask me I would prefer

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.320 
so if you had to ask me I would prefer
the<00:04:33.240> curly<00:04:33.570> simply<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.680> twist<00:04:34.950> my<00:04:35.010> hair<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.880> I
