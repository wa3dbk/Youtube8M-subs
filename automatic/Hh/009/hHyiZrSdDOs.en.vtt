cuz it just gets ridiculous here we go

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.789 
cuz it just gets ridiculous here we go
again

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
again

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.590 
again
-<00:03:37.250> coming<00:03:37.519> up<00:03:37.640> let's<00:03:38.000> see<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.120> can<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.510> away

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
- coming up let's see you can get away

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.390 
- coming up let's see you can get away
with<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:38.989> yeah<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.440> feel<00:03:39.769> like<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.130> whole

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
with that yeah I feel like that whole

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.349 
with that yeah I feel like that whole
match<00:03:40.609> good<00:03:40.820> went<00:03:40.970> differently<00:03:41.239> if<00:03:41.329> you

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
match good went differently if you

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.759 
match good went differently if you
didn't<00:03:41.540> lose<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:41.750> first<00:03:41.870> stock<00:03:42.109> so<00:03:42.260> cool<00:03:42.500> I

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
didn't lose that first stock so cool I

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.039 
didn't lose that first stock so cool I
like<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.370> counter<00:03:43.670> pick<00:03:43.850> from<00:03:44.150> from<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.720> Steve

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
like this counter pick from from a Steve

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.720 
like this counter pick from from a Steve
Sam<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.250> lot<00:03:46.370> because<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:47.269> how<00:03:47.690> much

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
Sam I like it a lot because of how much

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.490 
Sam I like it a lot because of how much
Mike<00:03:49.730> really<00:03:50.120> covers<00:03:50.510> like<00:03:50.900> with<00:03:51.200> all<00:03:51.380> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
Mike really covers like with all the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.860 
Mike really covers like with all the
cereals<00:03:51.920> right<00:03:52.489> I<00:03:52.880> think<00:03:53.030> how<00:03:53.269> much<00:03:53.359> platform

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
cereals right I think how much platform

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.300 
cereals right I think how much platform
coverage<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.230> get<00:03:54.380> that's<00:03:54.620> how<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.799> using<00:03:55.190> to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
coverage to get that's how you using to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.830 
coverage to get that's how you using to
be<00:03:55.400> properly<00:03:55.760> he's<00:03:56.150> gonna<00:03:56.359> use<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.569> stage<00:03:56.750> to

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
be properly he's gonna use the stage to

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.240 
be properly he's gonna use the stage to
convert<00:03:57.140> all<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:58.510> them<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.660> lon

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
convert all of them in lon

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.890 
convert all of them in lon
and<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:01.000> get<00:04:01.150> stingy<00:04:01.390> trapped<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
and we get stingy trapped on the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.000 
and we get stingy trapped on the
platform<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:02.320> you<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:02.530> utilize<00:04:02.980> that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
platform then you can utilize that

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.760 
platform then you can utilize that
disjoint<00:04:03.550> hitbox<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.660> sweep<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.560> cover

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
disjoint hitbox and just sweep and cover

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.040 
disjoint hitbox and just sweep and cover
too<00:04:05.950> much<00:04:06.100> this<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.910> gonna<00:04:07.240> have<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.630> up<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
too much this is gonna have that up that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.540 
too much this is gonna have that up that
up<00:04:08.080> here<00:04:08.350> we'll<00:04:08.530> kill<00:04:08.740> now<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.280> think<00:04:09.400> about

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
up here we'll kill now and think about

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.640 
up here we'll kill now and think about
the<00:04:09.610> office<00:04:09.880> -<00:04:10.000> man<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.510> think<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.230> I'll<00:04:11.440> smash

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
the office - man I think that I'll smash

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.470 
the office - man I think that I'll smash
if<00:04:11.830> critters<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.640> center<00:04:13.060> like

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
if critters like in the center like

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.270 
if critters like in the center like
right<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.900> position<00:04:14.080> then<00:04:14.860> he<00:04:15.010> can<00:04:15.130> maybe

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
right in that position then he can maybe

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.560 
right in that position then he can maybe
use<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.640> ostrich<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.940> can<00:04:16.060> cover<00:04:16.239> almost<00:04:16.390> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
use the ostrich you can cover almost the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.250 
use the ostrich you can cover almost the
entire<00:04:16.870> flash<00:04:17.140> I'll<00:04:17.320> cover<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.650> role<00:04:19.260> I'm

is gonna take that first stock right

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.650 
is gonna take that first stock right
back<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.430> we're<00:04:51.550> down<00:04:51.640> to<00:04:51.700> one<00:04:51.850> stock<00:04:52.390> apiece

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
back and we're down to one stock apiece

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.540 
back and we're down to one stock apiece
here<00:04:52.810> let's<00:04:53.380> go<00:04:53.500> see<00:04:53.710> what's<00:04:53.860> even<00:04:54.130> game<00:04:54.280> yeah

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
here let's go see what's even game yeah

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.940 
here let's go see what's even game yeah
you<00:04:54.760> know<00:04:54.850> create<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.270> back<00:04:55.419> certainly<00:04:55.990> just

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
you know create this back certainly just

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.830 
you know create this back certainly just
think<00:04:57.070> using<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.340> counter<00:04:57.840> somebody's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
think using that counter somebody's

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.480 
think using that counter somebody's
playing<00:04:58.900> me<00:04:59.080> why<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.260> counters<00:04:59.919> this<00:05:00.040> 10<00:05:00.310> damage

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
playing me why I counters this 10 damage

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.870 
playing me why I counters this 10 damage
offload<00:05:01.980> give<00:05:02.980> Mike<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.250> better<00:05:03.490> counter<00:05:03.760> than

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
offload give Mike a better counter than

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.420 
offload give Mike a better counter than
that<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.930> man<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.230> struggling<00:05:05.530> alright<00:05:05.950> look

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
that this man is struggling alright look

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.890 
that this man is struggling alright look
right<00:05:06.580> there<00:05:06.790> that<00:05:07.150> should<00:05:07.480> have<00:05:07.600> connected

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
right there that should have connected

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.320 
right there that should have connected
