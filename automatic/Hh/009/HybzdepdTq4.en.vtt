00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
can be used for power tumbling as well

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.720 
can be used for power tumbling as well
let's<00:00:10.110> say<00:00:10.200> you're<00:00:10.349> doing<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> front<00:00:10.920> tuck<00:00:11.160> you

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

run on to it do a front tuck obviously

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.609 
run on to it do a front tuck obviously
your<00:00:13.950> feet<00:00:14.370> would<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.690> trampoline<00:00:15.960> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
your feet would go on the trampoline and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.930 
your feet would go on the trampoline and
obviously<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.279> bounce<00:00:17.460> would<00:00:17.580> help<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
I did and this is to help like make the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
I did and this is to help like make the
beam<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.079> wider<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.770> could<00:00:44.129> see

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
beam a little bit wider as you could see

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
beam a little bit wider as you could see

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like it's a little bit wider than the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
like it's a little bit wider than the
real<00:00:46.860> beam<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.670> working<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:48.030> maybe

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
real beam so when I'm working out maybe

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
real beam so when I'm working out maybe
you<00:00:48.329> backed<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> need<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.530> bit

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you backed up so I need a little bit

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
you backed up so I need a little bit
more<00:00:49.829> support<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.489> put<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.510> man<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
more support I put this man on and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
more support I put this man on and
basically<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:53.670> folded<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:56.750> yeah<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
basically it's folded over so yeah it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.130 
basically it's folded over so yeah it
makes<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> maybe<00:00:58.739> about<00:00:59.100> five<00:00:59.460> six<00:00:59.760> inches

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
makes it maybe about five six inches

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.060 
makes it maybe about five six inches
then<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.649> way<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.730> comfortable<00:01:03.949> next<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
then for way more comfortable next I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
then for way more comfortable next I
have<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.400> blue<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.210> exercise<00:01:06.840> mat

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.319 
ground so I have two beams okay so next
I<00:04:04.659> have<00:04:04.810> my<00:04:04.959> bar<00:04:05.879> right<00:04:06.879> now<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.060> have<00:04:07.299> a

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
I have my bar right now I just have a

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.029 
I have my bar right now I just have a
Madden<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:07.959> it's<00:04:08.169> under<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.530> couch<00:04:08.650> but

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:09.039 
Madden I know it's under the couch but

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.240 
Madden I know it's under the couch but
or<00:04:09.129> else<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.459> doesn't<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.879> isn't<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.359> sturdy

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
or else it doesn't it isn't like sturdy

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.999 
or else it doesn't it isn't like sturdy
so<00:04:12.250> yeah<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.479> right<00:04:14.289> now<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:14.439> think<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:14.859> like

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 
so yeah and right now I think it's like

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.459 
so yeah and right now I think it's like
four<00:04:15.310> feet<00:04:15.729> five<00:04:16.389> inches<00:04:16.419> off<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.930> ground

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:17.469 
four feet five inches off the ground

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.860 
four feet five inches off the ground
and<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.549> has<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.969> Kip<00:04:19.180> swing<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.659> I'll<00:04:19.719> go

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
and then it has a Kip swing and I'll go

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.379 
and then it has a Kip swing and I'll go
a<00:04:19.900> little<00:04:20.079> closer<00:04:20.409> so<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.880> Kip<00:04:22.060> swing

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
a little closer so this is the Kip swing

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.909 
a little closer so this is the Kip swing
and<00:04:22.570> basically<00:04:22.840> what<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.620> put

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
and basically what you do is you put

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.020 
and basically what you do is you put
this<00:04:24.219> I<00:04:24.400> use<00:04:24.520> first

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030
