00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
was more impressed by the smell of it

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.550 
was more impressed by the smell of it
when<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.980> first<00:03:23.430> opened<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.150> am<00:03:24.420> when<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> taste

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
when I first opened it I am when I taste

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.420 
when I first opened it I am when I taste
it<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:26.069> have<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.580> give<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.790> credit<00:03:27.090> for<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> iso

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
it I have to give up credit for the iso

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.880 
it I have to give up credit for the iso
because<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.090> quite<00:03:30.300> good<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.230> overall<00:03:31.769> I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
because that is quite good so overall I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.000 
because that is quite good so overall I
think<00:03:32.190> I'd<00:03:32.459> give<00:03:32.640> these<00:03:33.620> seven<00:03:34.620> point<00:03:34.829> five

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
think I'd give these seven point five

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.000 
think I'd give these seven point five
out<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.340> ten<00:03:35.690> mostly<00:03:36.690> because<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.739> can't

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
out of ten mostly because you can't

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.750 
out of ten mostly because you can't
really<00:03:38.160> taste<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:40.160> cracker<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.579> the

really taste the cracker like the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.920 
really taste the cracker like the
cracker<00:03:42.000> flavor<00:03:42.329> doesn't<00:03:42.480> really<00:03:42.660> taste<00:03:42.840> like

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
cracker flavor doesn't really taste like

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.069 
cracker flavor doesn't really taste like
red<00:03:43.170> velvet<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.739> my<00:03:43.920> opinion<00:03:44.130> um<00:03:44.600> cream<00:03:45.600> cheese

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
red velvet in my opinion um cream cheese

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.680 
red velvet in my opinion um cream cheese
icing<00:03:46.290> was<00:03:46.860> good<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.370> did<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:48.090> tart<00:03:48.329> after

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
icing was good it did have a tart after

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.800 
icing was good it did have a tart after
taste<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.110> cream<00:03:49.350> cheese<00:03:49.410> um<00:03:50.630> cracker<00:03:51.630> was

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
taste like cream cheese um cracker was

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.910 
taste like cream cheese um cracker was
just<00:03:51.989> disappointing<00:03:52.470> though<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:52.829> don't

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
just disappointing though like I don't

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.080 
just disappointing though like I don't
know<00:03:53.070> how<00:03:53.340> much<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.579> could<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.790> done<00:03:53.910> with

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
know how much you could have done with

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.640 
know how much you could have done with
it<00:03:54.120> anyway<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.630> red<00:03:54.959> velvet<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.320> just

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
it anyway because red velvet is just

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.130 
it anyway because red velvet is just
sugar<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.299> does<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.660> tastes<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.989> sugar

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
sugar but it does just tastes like sugar

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.020 
sugar but it does just tastes like sugar
so<00:03:58.530> maybe<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.040> was<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.160> win-win<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.700> don't<00:03:59.910> know

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
so maybe that was a win-win I don't know

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.920 
so maybe that was a win-win I don't know
what<00:04:00.150> else<00:04:00.180> they<00:04:00.390> wouldn't<00:04:00.570> made<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.780> taste

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
what else they wouldn't made it taste

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
what else they wouldn't made it taste
like<00:04:01.019> cream<00:04:01.680> cheese<00:04:01.739> icing<00:04:02.010> was<00:04:02.250> good<00:04:02.489> though

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
like cream cheese icing was good though

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.039

be available for six to eight weeks

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.500 
be available for six to eight weeks
which<00:04:16.229> means<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.979> think<00:04:17.940> they'd<00:04:18.060> be<00:04:18.180> gone<00:04:18.299> by

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
which means I think they'd be gone by

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.210 
which means I think they'd be gone by
the<00:04:18.570> end<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.140> april<00:04:19.260> know<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.890> beginning<00:04:20.160> of

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
the end of april know the beginning of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.640 
the end of april know the beginning of
april<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.600> want<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.780> get<00:04:21.840> them<00:04:22.049> before

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.520 
april so if you want to get them before
then<00:04:22.979> um<00:04:23.600> they're<00:04:24.600> worth<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.930> try<00:04:25.140> i<00:04:25.169> think

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
then um they're worth a try i think
