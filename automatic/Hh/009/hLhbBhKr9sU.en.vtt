00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.630
 no no 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 our mission in this case was to catch 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.380
 this house between medianeras whose 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.710
 facades had to be maintained because 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.420
 they were part of the heritage and 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 rebuild all your interior we are going to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.870
 reformulate what was a dwelling 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.199
 which is in a state of ruin 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.520
 in a house completely habitable but 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.520
 with an economy of important means 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.350
 one of our main 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.630
 concerns was to see how we would be 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.030
 able to take a construction management 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.590
 at such a distance but in riad was one 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.560
 of the first projects we had 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.990
 in the office or outside of Catalonia 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 then at the beginning we set out 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 work with industrialized systems 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.900
 because we knew that we could not be 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 very pending in the work after 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.659
 we change all the systems of the house 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.310
 and we realized that working with 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.050
 professionals from the area who know very 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.360
 well the traditional construction and such 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.860
 it was the most appropriate not because people 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200
 from there to the end he felt much more 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.940
 familiar with materials like 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.940
 Ceramic or steel 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.009
 one of the important decisions of the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.920
 project is the introduction of a patio 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.280
 formed by metal structure and glass 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 that apart from introducing light in all 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 the rooms introduce a new 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 material that is not the proper of the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.560
 heavy construction of the place and finish 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.860
 thus contributing colors and support 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.080
 to contrast between a structure 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.489
 rough and deformed with materials 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.489
 unpolluted and controlled
