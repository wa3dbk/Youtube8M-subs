00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
running away from this but it gives

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.690 
running away from this but it gives
couple<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.170> different<00:02:13.440> sides<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.099> story<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
couple of different sides the story and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.180 
couple of different sides the story and
it<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.180> makes<00:02:15.510> KC<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.319> little<00:02:16.860> bit<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.040> an

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it kind of makes KC a little bit of an

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.010 
it kind of makes KC a little bit of an
unreliable<00:02:17.670> narrator<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.630> thought<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
unreliable narrator and I thought that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.949 
unreliable narrator and I thought that
that<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.770> fun<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> fact<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
that was really fun and the fact that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.949 
that was really fun and the fact that
there's<00:02:22.290> also<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.970> monster<00:02:24.180> who<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
there's also is that a monster who is

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.890 
there's also is that a monster who is
killing<00:02:25.560> her<00:02:25.770> friends<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.209> definitely<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.870> a

killing her friends you definitely see a
little<00:02:28.260> bit<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.920> an<00:02:29.310> actual<00:02:29.819> monster<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.540> the
