00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
like some sine wave like cosine wave

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.440 
like some sine wave like cosine wave
sine<00:00:37.410> wave<00:00:37.969> whatever<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> call<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
sine wave whatever you want to call it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
sine wave whatever you want to call it
if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.710> mathematical<00:00:41.399> on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
if you want to get all mathematical on

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
if you want to get all mathematical on
this<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.629> has<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:43.020> amplitude<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.829> 4.5<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:46.640> a

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.130 

period<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:52.070> let's<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:54.739> I'd<00:00:55.739> say<00:00:57.109> has<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
period of about let's see I'd say has a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.450 
period of about let's see I'd say has a
period<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> about<00:01:00.559> 10<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.370> 9<00:01:03.090> yeah

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
period of about 10 I don't know 9 yeah

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.429 
period of about 10 I don't know 9 yeah
so<00:01:05.460> yeah<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.180> um<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:07.020> tried<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> make
