00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 I am very happy 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.079
 It is the first time many people play the game 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 very important after getting there 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 6 were in asia 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.550

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.760
 then arises 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.600

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.540
 it is a further set of twickel 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.460
 I just have 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 learned a lot after positive return to affordable care 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.590
 I grew up there, as it were 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 made what I am now 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.340
 percent 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.820
 the girl Amsterdam orleans or not 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.060
 there is Amsterdam 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.349
 utrecht 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.339
 through the night with family 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.099
 groningen is also a nice step to take 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.609
 it is so good 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.969
 the man who brought the trio to groningen is pieter huishuis 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.869
 in the 2009 2010 season, he was in charge of coaching Ajax players 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.469
 and so is aware of the qualities 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.170
 excellently excel 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.920
 johan milan they have made a lot of minutes in the competition 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.899
 unfortunately a little less chance of a bit due to the suspensions that have been incurred 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.869
 but i am very satisfied with all three and yes they actually do what i like 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.019
 had thought and hoped beforehand and that is only good for FC Groningen 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.179
 you started the season very spectacularly, even the top ten 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.589
 the classification of v 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.799
 did you expect it to go so fast 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.459
 say no to 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.959
 I understand I do not expect it so quickly but many viewers so you see 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.459
 But again how fast football can go if you are very good 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.469
 play and you continue to develop then it really goes 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.269
 huistra is not only well-known players but also his colleague trainer frank the farmer 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.559
 knows good looks time at ajax 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.659
 yes I have often experienced close up, they are very eager to learn 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.449
 is that 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.809
 and I think that he himself has all the wisdom in lease, listen the other ones too 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.689
 well I do that I want to take a more advantage and that you are yourself 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.119
 as a player 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:32.129
 they are very different from dealing with a group, I am experts in that 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.659
 soccer at each and at least that you should be know of from people 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.389
 know psychology children from group processes and before you are me 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.899
 I think the farmer will take a good look around you 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:51.599
 what else prepared and yes I think you see that happen now also the young 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.899
 trainers in the netherlands and for a good development itself he is also standing 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:56.979
 the young steps 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.359
 last season he made his debut in the premier league against ajax with a 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.509
 deserving 2 2 draw 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.509
 there he worked on television in the ajax match 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.079
 You can't actually allow PSV there and he puts it that you get used to it 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.509
 bit now that there are still clubs in the netherlands 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.339
 And yes, in the club that is underneath, very happy to be processed 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 There you have to play a top club against humanity 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.499
 in the seventies special special dynamics in a special forces 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.439
 such a competition but that release and yes that is very normal phenomenon Amsterdam 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.460
 anp ajax to win 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.430
 in the plus 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.050
 I entered 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.990
 but waiting for it 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.300
 With local players it becomes very difficult to remember 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.370
 certainly also my clients enjoy this year against those in libya boy 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.610
 plays with 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.300
 yes i played a lot more times in the device itself so yes 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.750
 there is fun anyway
