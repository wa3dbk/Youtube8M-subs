00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
ok so it's basically it's a kit what it
includes<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.149> case<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> phone<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> the

in<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.550> telephoto<00:00:54.239> lens<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> total<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
in a telephoto lens there's a total of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.430 
in a telephoto lens there's a total of
four<00:00:55.620> lenses<00:00:56.239> once<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.420> telephoto<00:00:57.930> one<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.739> a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
four lenses once a telephoto one is a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.609 
four lenses once a telephoto one is a
one<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.390> wide-angle<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.470> there's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
one is a wide-angle and I think there's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.630 
one is a wide-angle and I think there's
a<00:01:04.680> fisheye<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.170> sure<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.500> else<00:01:07.640> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a fisheye and I'm not sure what else so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
a fisheye and I'm not sure what else so
anyway<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
anyway you can kind of see how that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
anyway you can kind of see how that
works<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:12.990> telephoto

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
works right there so we have telephoto

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
works right there so we have telephoto
lens<00:01:13.799> cleaning<00:01:14.189> cloth<00:01:14.330> universal<00:01:15.330> holder

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
lens cleaning cloth universal holder

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.749 
lens cleaning cloth universal holder
mini<00:01:16.049> tripod<00:01:16.619> protective<00:01:17.460> case<00:01:17.670> bag<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
mini tripod protective case bag and I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.420 
mini tripod protective case bag and I
think<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> macro<00:01:22.110> wins<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.530> believe<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
think one of the macro wins I believe so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.719 
think one of the macro wins I believe so
anyway<00:01:23.729> I'll<00:01:24.150> open<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.570> thing<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> then

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
anyway I'll open this thing up and then

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.560 
anyway I'll open this thing up and then
experiment<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.270> bit<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
experiment with it a little bit so I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.780 
experiment with it a little bit so I
opened<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> box<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.979> there's<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
opened the box up and so there's also a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.480 
opened the box up and so there's also a
miniature<00:01:33.479> tripod<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.189> part<00:01:35.430> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
miniature tripod with it this is part of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.800 
miniature tripod with it this is part of
the<00:01:35.610> tripod<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:39.299> telephoto

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the tripod and this is the the telephoto

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
the tripod and this is the the telephoto
lens<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.189> moving<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:45.299> part

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
lens right there and so moving that part

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.899 
lens right there and so moving that part
out<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:49.759> what<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.820> we

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
out of the way we have the what do we

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.170 
out of the way we have the what do we
have<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:53.070> part<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.700> exactly

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
have here we have that part not exactly

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.749 
have here we have that part not exactly
I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> lenses<00:01:55.579> this<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
I think that's one of the lenses this is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.170 
I think that's one of the lenses this is
another<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> lenses<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:59.030> then<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
another one of the lenses and then you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
another one of the lenses and then you
got<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.439> actually<00:02:01.920> uh<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:03.649> think<00:02:04.649> that's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
got this is actually uh I think that's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
got this is actually uh I think that's
actually<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.520> part<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> Tri<00:02:06.630> that's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
actually a part of the Tri that's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
actually a part of the Tri that's
actually<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> tripod<00:02:07.920> mount<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> phone<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
actually a tripod mount for the phone so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.630 
actually a tripod mount for the phone so
you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.229> miniature<00:02:11.069> tripod

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you can put it on this miniature tripod

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.330 
you can put it on this miniature tripod
that<00:02:11.910> came<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.360> or<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.680> could<00:02:13.890> just

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that came with or you could just

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280 
that came with or you could just
you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.879> also<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.599> right<00:02:15.810> standard

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you can also that's a right standard

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.040 
you can also that's a right standard
tripods<00:02:16.830> thread<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.569> could<00:02:18.720> put<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.989> on

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
tripods thread so you could put that on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.930 
tripods thread so you could put that on
regular<00:02:19.590> tripod<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
regular tripod and then you have the the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.000 
regular tripod and then you have the the
the<00:02:23.940> bag<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.519> finally<00:02:26.519> here<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:29.900> back

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the bag and finally here is the back

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.589 
the bag and finally here is the back
that<00:02:32.010> snaps<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.819> back<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.580> phone<00:02:35.599> and

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
that snaps on the back of the phone and

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.750 
that snaps on the back of the phone and
the<00:02:37.410> phone<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.220> course<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the phone that I have of course is a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.580 
the phone that I have of course is a
Galaxy<00:02:39.510> Note<00:02:40.019> 3<00:02:42.260> ok<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:45.140> through<00:02:46.140> I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
Galaxy Note 3 ok so that is through I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.740 
Galaxy Note 3 ok so that is through I
grabbed<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.849> lenses<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.480> think

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
grabbed one of the lenses and I think

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.250 
grabbed one of the lenses and I think
that's<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.230> wide-angle<00:02:51.049> version<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
that's the wide-angle version of the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.410 
that's the wide-angle version of the
lens<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> course<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:53.940> set<00:02:54.239> up

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
lens now of course I have this set up

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.080 
lens now of course I have this set up
and<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> phone<00:02:55.860> sets<00:02:56.280> up<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.730> set<00:02:56.970> up

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and so that the phone sets up is set up

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.710 
and so that the phone sets up is set up
so<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.299> auto<00:02:57.769> stabilizes<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> ends

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so that auto stabilizes and so it ends

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.380 
so that auto stabilizes and so it ends
up<00:03:00.810> zooming<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> image<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.209> I

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
up zooming in a bit on the image so if I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.160 
up zooming in a bit on the image so if I
were<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.629> turn<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.200> auto<00:03:04.489> stabilization<00:03:05.489> off

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
were to turn the auto stabilization off

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.130 
were to turn the auto stabilization off
it<00:03:07.170> would<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.650> zoomed<00:03:08.040> out<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.959> bit

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
it would be zoomed out just a bit

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.369 
it would be zoomed out just a bit
farther<00:03:10.410> than<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:12.769> ok<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
farther than it is ok and so this is the

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.050 
farther than it is ok and so this is the
fisheye<00:03:16.379> lens<00:03:16.769> now<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:18.030> course<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
fisheye lens now of course I have the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.080 
fisheye lens now of course I have the
zoom<00:03:21.060> or<00:03:21.540> I'm<00:03:21.810> sorry<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.440> auto<00:03:22.680> station

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
zoom or I'm sorry the auto station

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.330 
zoom or I'm sorry the auto station
stabilization<00:03:24.090> feature<00:03:24.269> switched<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
stabilization feature switched on and so

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.129 
stabilization feature switched on and so
it<00:03:26.430> did<00:03:26.700> zoom<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.299> little<00:03:27.510> bit<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.989> I'm<00:03:28.109> going

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
it did zoom in a little bit so I'm going

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.120 
it did zoom in a little bit so I'm going
to<00:03:28.350> stop<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.310> turn<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.810> auto

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
to stop this and turn off the auto

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.949 
to stop this and turn off the auto
stabilization<00:03:32.130> feature<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.780> can

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
stabilization feature so that you can

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.460 
stabilization feature so that you can
see<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.349> difference<00:03:35.840> ok<00:03:36.840> now<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.200> can<00:03:37.319> see

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
see the difference ok now you can see

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.379 
see the difference ok now you can see
the<00:03:37.769> difference<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.400> video

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
the difference the the video

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.509 
the difference the the video
stabilization<00:03:39.750> feature<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.920> turned<00:03:41.160> off<00:03:41.489> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
stabilization feature is turned off and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.250 
stabilization feature is turned off and
so<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.049> get

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
so you can see that you know you get

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.370 
so you can see that you know you get
more<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.950> fisheye<00:03:47.430> type<00:03:48.450> lens<00:03:48.810> effect

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
more of the fisheye type lens effect

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.400 
more of the fisheye type lens effect
right<00:03:50.010> there<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:51.510> know<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:51.900> that's<00:03:52.169> a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
right there you know and that's that's a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.039 
right there you know and that's that's a
more<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.250> normal<00:03:53.669> fisheye<00:03:54.120> lens<00:03:54.480> where<00:03:54.900> it

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
more of a normal fisheye lens where it

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.420 
more of a normal fisheye lens where it
kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.669> you<00:03:56.669> get<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.880> super<00:03:57.359> wide<00:03:57.540> angle<00:03:58.230> view

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
kind of you get a super wide angle view

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.069 
kind of you get a super wide angle view
to<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.549> point<00:03:59.790> where<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.299> sort<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.690> makes<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
to the point where it sort of makes it

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.440 
to the point where it sort of makes it
you<00:04:01.260> know<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:02.040> edges<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.669> image<00:04:02.849> sort

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
you know the the edges of the image sort

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.379 
you know the the edges of the image sort
of<00:04:03.540> end<00:04:03.720> up<00:04:03.810> looking<00:04:04.169> around<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.389> that's

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
of end up looking around it and that's

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.849 
of end up looking around it and that's
sort<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.840> fisheye<00:04:07.500> lens<00:04:07.799> effect<00:04:09.680> ok<00:04:10.680> now

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
sort of the fisheye lens effect ok now

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.050 
sort of the fisheye lens effect ok now
this<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.130> gonna<00:04:11.250> be<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.430> little<00:04:11.609> bit<00:04:11.819> jittery

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this is gonna be a little bit jittery

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.759 
this is gonna be a little bit jittery
I've<00:04:12.810> got<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.349> 12x<00:04:14.540> telephoto<00:04:15.540> lens<00:04:15.959> screwed

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
I've got the 12x telephoto lens screwed

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.370 
I've got the 12x telephoto lens screwed
into<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.070> case<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.690> I've<00:04:18.870> got<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.200> thing

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
into the case and I've got this thing

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.279 
into the case and I've got this thing
kind<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.709> balance<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.430> my<00:04:20.459> knee<00:04:20.789> I<00:04:21.539> don't<00:04:22.109> have

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
kind of balance on my knee I don't have

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.370 
kind of balance on my knee I don't have
it<00:04:22.409> in<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> tripod<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.810> see<00:04:25.080> that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
it in the tripod and so you can see that

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.020 
it in the tripod and so you can see that
I'm<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:26.219> is<00:04:26.370> from<00:04:26.580> exact

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
I'm this is from exact

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.240 
I'm this is from exact
actly<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.600> same<00:04:27.840> position<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.980> was

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
actly the same position that I was

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.550 
actly the same position that I was
earlier<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.910> haven't<00:04:30.389> moved<00:04:30.600> from<00:04:31.110> any<00:04:31.380> of

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
earlier I haven't moved from any of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.250 
earlier I haven't moved from any of
these<00:04:31.710> shots<00:04:32.450> still<00:04:33.450> sitting<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> same

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
these shots still sitting in the same

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.100 
these shots still sitting in the same
chair<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:35.010> same<00:04:35.250> position<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.960> can

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
chair in the same position and you can

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.180 
chair in the same position and you can
kind<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.380> see<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.980> difference<00:04:38.960> yeah<00:04:40.040> but<00:04:41.040> with

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
kind of see the difference yeah but with

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.230 
kind of see the difference yeah but with
I<00:04:41.400> must<00:04:41.639> say<00:04:41.790> with<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> telephoto<00:04:42.690> lens<00:04:43.220> it's

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
I must say with the telephoto lens it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.180 
I must say with the telephoto lens it's
you<00:04:45.240> know<00:04:45.360> you'd<00:04:45.570> really<00:04:46.080> need<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.800> order<00:04:47.100> to

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
you know you'd really need in order to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.820 
you know you'd really need in order to
hold<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.490> really<00:04:47.700> steady<00:04:48.139> I'd<00:04:49.139> either<00:04:49.290> really

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
hold it really steady I'd either really

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.680 
hold it really steady I'd either really
have<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.190> be<00:04:50.310> braced<00:04:50.760> up<00:04:51.060> against<00:04:51.389> something

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
have to be braced up against something

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.900 
have to be braced up against something
or<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:53.240> would<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.450> be<00:04:54.690> using<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.580> tripod

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.820 

so<00:04:59.910> what<00:05:00.090> we're<00:05:00.270> looking<00:05:00.300> at<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.110> series<00:05:01.800> of

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
so what we're looking at is a series of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.130 
so what we're looking at is a series of
macro<00:05:02.760> shots<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:04.910> was<00:05:05.910> able<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.210> take<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.660> picture

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
macro shots I was able to take a picture

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.190 
macro shots I was able to take a picture
of<00:05:07.200> my<00:05:07.590> thumb<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.340> then<00:05:08.900> another<00:05:09.900> little

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
of my thumb and then another little

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.630 
of my thumb and then another little
close-up<00:05:10.530> now<00:05:10.770> what<00:05:11.100> we're<00:05:11.250> looking<00:05:11.280> at<00:05:11.580> right

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
close-up now what we're looking at right

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.960 
close-up now what we're looking at right
there<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.540> camera<00:05:13.410> itself<00:05:13.650> with<00:05:14.370> no<00:05:14.610> lens

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
there is the camera itself with no lens

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.210 
there is the camera itself with no lens
and<00:05:15.300> then<00:05:15.390> that's<00:05:15.600> what<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.930> 12x<00:05:16.590> telephoto

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
and then that's what the 12x telephoto

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.030 
and then that's what the 12x telephoto
lens<00:05:17.520> screwed<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.380> same<00:05:19.380> way<00:05:19.410> with<00:05:19.830> that

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
lens screwed in same way with that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.310 
lens screwed in same way with that
that's<00:05:20.430> with<00:05:20.669> no<00:05:20.700> lens<00:05:21.419> on<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.720> camera<00:05:21.750> at<00:05:22.140> all

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
that's with no lens on the camera at all

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
that's with no lens on the camera at all
and<00:05:22.650> that's<00:05:23.490> with<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.419> 12x<00:05:25.350> telephoto<00:05:26.040> and

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
and that's with the 12x telephoto and

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.480 
and that's with the 12x telephoto and
again<00:05:27.240> with<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.500> Telex<00:05:28.940> 12x<00:05:29.940> telephoto<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:34.080> I

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
again with the Telex 12x telephoto so I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.980 
again with the Telex 12x telephoto so I
will<00:05:35.490> end<00:05:35.700> up<00:05:35.820> experimenting<00:05:36.479> with<00:05:36.750> this<00:05:36.930> and

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
will end up experimenting with this and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.690 
will end up experimenting with this and
I<00:05:37.260> might<00:05:37.470> include<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.669> few<00:05:38.880> photos<00:05:39.210> just

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
I might include a few photos just

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.500 
I might include a few photos just
briefly<00:05:41.700> experimenting<00:05:42.570> with<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.080> far<00:05:43.350> and

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
briefly experimenting with it so far and

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.510 
briefly experimenting with it so far and
the<00:05:45.510> problem<00:05:45.900> with<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.110> fix<00:05:46.350> of<00:05:46.560> zoom<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:47.220> that

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
the problem with the fix of zoom is that

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.090 
the problem with the fix of zoom is that
you<00:05:47.820> kind<00:05:48.600> of<00:05:48.660> have<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:49.169> be<00:05:49.320> in<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.530> place<00:05:49.770> where

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
you kind of have to be in a place where

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.270 
you kind of have to be in a place where
you<00:05:50.220> can<00:05:50.870> move<00:05:51.870> around<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.680> order<00:05:52.890> to<00:05:53.039> you

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
you can move around in order to you

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.300 
you can move around in order to you
really<00:05:53.789> utilize<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:55.410> know<00:05:55.500> like<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.740> telephoto

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
really utilize you know like a telephoto

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.730 
really utilize you know like a telephoto
lens<00:05:56.430> it's<00:05:56.970> not<00:05:57.120> a<00:05:57.150> zoom<00:05:57.450> its<00:05:57.750> telephoto

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
lens it's not a zoom its telephoto

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.090 
lens it's not a zoom its telephoto
so<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.640> strictly<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.479> 12x<00:06:01.050> telephoto<00:06:01.650> so

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
so it's just strictly a 12x telephoto so

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.940 
so it's just strictly a 12x telephoto so
I'll<00:06:04.850> experiment<00:06:05.850> with<00:06:05.970> it<00:06:06.090> 4/5<00:06:06.479> but<00:06:06.660> for<00:06:06.950> $57

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
I'll experiment with it 4/5 but for $57

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.409 
I'll experiment with it 4/5 but for $57
right<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.430> know<00:06:08.550> it's<00:06:08.760> sort<00:06:09.330> of<00:06:09.419> a<00:06:09.539> casual

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
right you know it's sort of a casual

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.870 
right you know it's sort of a casual
little<00:06:12.419> thing<00:06:12.660> to<00:06:12.930> play<00:06:13.710> with<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:14.039> phone<00:06:14.280> it's

more fun generally speaking it's pretty

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.710 
more fun generally speaking it's pretty
fun<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:18.080> try<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.140> take<00:06:19.470> something<00:06:19.770> lesser<00:06:20.720> like

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
fun to try to take something lesser like

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.150 
fun to try to take something lesser like
this<00:06:21.960> you<00:06:22.169> know<00:06:22.260> like<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:25.110> camera<00:06:25.590> that's

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
this you know like the camera that's

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.659 
this you know like the camera that's
built<00:06:26.280> into<00:06:26.729> a<00:06:26.970> telephone<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:28.370> see<00:06:29.370> what<00:06:29.640> I

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
built into a telephone and see what I

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.650 
built into a telephone and see what I
can<00:06:29.940> make<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.270> do<00:06:30.479> versus<00:06:32.360> you<00:06:33.360> know<00:06:33.390> like<00:06:33.630> a

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
can make it do versus you know like a

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.820 
can make it do versus you know like a
higher<00:06:34.410> powered<00:06:34.890> DSLR<00:06:35.700> it's

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
higher powered DSLR it's

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.790 
higher powered DSLR it's
it's<00:06:36.950> more<00:06:37.160> interesting<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:37.700> see<00:06:37.910> what<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:38.800> if

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
it's more interesting to see what the if

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.510 
it's more interesting to see what the if
you<00:06:39.950> can<00:06:40.130> kind<00:06:40.970> of<00:06:41.090> push<00:06:41.540> something<00:06:41.960> that<00:06:42.770> you

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
you can kind of push something that you

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.040 
you can kind of push something that you
know<00:06:43.640> beyond<00:06:44.030> its<00:06:44.330> limits<00:06:45.070> versus<00:06:47.050> something

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
know beyond its limits versus something

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.050 
know beyond its limits versus something
that<00:06:48.230> was<00:06:48.350> designed<00:06:48.770> with<00:06:49.490> really<00:06:49.850> good

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
that was designed with really good
