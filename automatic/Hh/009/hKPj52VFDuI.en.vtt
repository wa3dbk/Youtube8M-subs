 win a single goal that's right and not 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.590
 only you'll take a lesson from 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.740
 basket but in addition you will take a 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.190
 math class to paraphrase magic 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.770

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.790
 in short that he made over 1000 in 1994 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.070
 to succeed this shot son 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.130
 you have to jostle your opponent 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.930
 to cart like that with your friend 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.310
 killed without the big game I made a 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.640
 little dress on the right and the more you pues 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.640
 vote on the left 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.360
 and a blow like that is magic 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.810

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.330

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.580
 a little here so do not do your bad 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.420

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.580
 I did not want to listen to me 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.770
 you have to work hard it's a sport of 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.270
 persevering not like braggarts 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.040
 take the big champions michael 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.080
 jordan first in training the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.480
 last to leave the room and larry bird 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.000
 he grabbed 300 baskets in one 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.770
 night nothing to be ready and shaquille 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.270
 o'neal he has never weakened these francs 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.340
 yeah and ben when they sufficiently 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.540
 great for this match and without skipping 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.050
 can very well do without 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.120
 free throws 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.890
 but you must respect the sport 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.080
 you are a good player and have the potential 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.630
 to become a great player but he 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.770
 must you want it good we had 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.330
 bet and I lost 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:01.140
 what should I do you 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:09.570
 ask what you need to do a little 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:17.580
 know the word to juniors hurry up 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:21.030

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.550
 superstars on board 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.590

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.520
 a deal but we see half of my 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.260
 butt I know that's why this 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.260
