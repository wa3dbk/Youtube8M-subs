00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.210
 for diets 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.800
 but working 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.800
 and 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.060
 let's start by taking 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060
 the phases 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.860
 and the glue 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 and in series we are going to take 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 and we will not deny 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 we are going to press for this 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.060
 way they look good 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 remember that this past we are going to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.350
 repeat 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 and then let's sit down 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630
 Y 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.590
 the excess of the glue that has 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.100
 stayed to give it a better finish 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.100
 our work 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 i 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 or chains 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.790
 taking 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.750
 If you are going to continue like this 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.260
 and in this case the children chains 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.590
 of separation success but 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.769
 of the 47 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.610
 you can do it remember that only 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.670
 who taught you how to do 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.630
 but who decides what you touch and how is it going to 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.630
 to be you 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.330
 but 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.340
 without giving the pearls and the string 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:04.380
 will cease with the help of a pair of tweezers 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.930
 to take the end of the wire and what 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.010
 we are going to bend inwards as 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.770
 shows in the video people avoid from 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.980
 that what we just insert can not be 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.980
 go out 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.630
 of your wire and start inserting 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.680
 the estoperoles either by the by one 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.100
 of 200 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.190
 by the base of the bollards you have the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.729
 place your very few this is with the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.889
 purpose that the bolsters do not 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.479
 are moving with each other 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.479
 as shown in the video 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.010
 A) Yes 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.200
 when you worry about reservations 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.130
 wire that's left over and that's what we're going to 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.130
 cut at the end 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:31.510
 I tried topero pieces because now 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.220
 you can put more or you can put less 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.220
 weight already dependent 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.910
 then proceed to shape 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.220
 in the way I would 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:55.580
 the video remembers that in a way like 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.830
 of a cane but at the same time 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.640
 that goes with that couple 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.640
 Y 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.120
 let's take our solitary now 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.120
 continuation 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:19.000
 the exterior 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.590
 where is the hole and 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.259
 get to see a very good wire 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.020
 right there we are going to place the 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:32.190
 glue 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:33.700
 remember once so it does not look bad 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.500
 and we are also going to add 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:40.800
 but in the pearls at the beginning and at the end 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.699
 so that the pearls do not move 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.699
 that place 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.120
 once you've let time pass 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.450
 and songs just the glue you're going to 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.950
 proceed to remove the tape that 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.950
 we had put at the base of the 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:15.760
 think about it, I hope I have you 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.760
 liked the project 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.030
 If you have not done it, do not forget to leave a 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.639
 commentary 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:26.070
 if you like the video like remember that 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.680
 that helped me a lot 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.230
 remember that you and I have an appointment on 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.790
 next video I command kisses 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.510
 plastic 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.510
 until next time
