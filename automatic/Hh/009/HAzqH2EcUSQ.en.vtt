 chile in constitution particularly 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.340
 because a Chilean representative of the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.140
 female boxing a discipline that wants 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.630
 little diffusion that has few exponents

 second world title and this time 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.830
 fighting in Mexico against the champion 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.230
 current of the international federation 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.600
 of boxing and álex pérez a combat 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.690
 disputed monterrey disputed the 10 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 assaults where he showed all the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.740
 characteristics that the boxer has 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.810
 Chilean kept her fighting style 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.210
 received a couple of impacts from the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.820
 Mexican but basically controlled each 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 one of the assaults even of the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 blows he received lost his protector 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 mouth at that time the referee stops 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 the fight so he can have it again 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.670
 that mouthguard got hit but 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.740
 however, he was closer to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.659
 stay with the knockout and stay 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 definitely when the end comes 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.350
 of the tenth round with 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.850
 together speculated that judges 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.710
 they were going to have a local character that 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 they always give him a little more 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.150
 benefits to whoever holds the title 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.160
 worldwide which was in this case the Mexican 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.100
 however the decision of the judges 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.530
 he favored the Chilean who moves forward 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.290
 this fight has a mark of 12 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.550
 consecutive wins does not know the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.580
 defeat the Chilean 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.590
 Rodriguez has won from those 12 a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.230
 only by knockout the rest have been 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 in definitions of this kind where he achieves 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.619
 impose supremacy and they are the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.050
 transmission commentators speak 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.150
 of a lesson on how they fight in 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.540
 visitor condition whistles them 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.300
 Rodriguez was able to prevail in this fight 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.740
 that had a great audience frame 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.470
 and that responded to expectations 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 because she had already surprised everything 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 the national environment when last year 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.820
 he stayed with his first his first title 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.850
 of the rooster category that time for the ub 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.230
 w sees a boxing organization 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.250
 female and this is the federation 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.640
 international female boxing 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.650
 this crown this title that surely 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.050
 will bring to Chile the next few hours 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.910
 that is going to be celebrated in constitution and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.500
 all the people who have supported him are the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.350
 exact moment where it begins to deliver 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.780
 the score of the cards and it is announced 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.300
 that is unanimous that none of the judges 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.520
 of the three judges granted him the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.770
 possibility of winning the Mexican jumps 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.230
 with the Chilean flag on his back the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.640
 cristina rodríguez to start 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.650
 send greetings immediately in a 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.440
 transmission that followed with other evenings 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 other male boxing fights so 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.130
 so far the only thing that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.370
 we have is the greeting that she made 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.690
 once this fight is over 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.790
 obviously giving him the message of 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.739
 encouragement to all Chileans 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.959
 giving his support to the people of 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.510
 constitution to which she herself 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.790
 represents we were quickly is 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.739
 these first statements of the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.989
 Cristina Rodriguez after staying with her 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.439
 second world title 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.439
 greeting chile 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.410
 is the message in the ring ring where 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 was the crespa rodríguez receiving 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.150
 this second boxing title and that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.160
 obviously it opens the expectations for 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.860
 that now if the companies support it 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.110
 now so I can continue is this race 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.610
 what brings boxing satisfactions 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.270
 Chileans and we look for satisfactions 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.270
