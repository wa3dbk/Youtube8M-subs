just<00:00:53.910> amazing<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:55.530> perhaps<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:58.280> deliver

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just amazing it's perhaps you deliver

saying<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> few<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.890> now

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
saying what a few see you can do but now

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
saying what a few see you can do but now
we're<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.340> ps3<00:01:02.579> which<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> even<00:01:03.180> better<00:01:03.210> now

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we're on ps3 which is even better now

we're on ps3 which is even better now
but<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.400> fake<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.030> guess

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
but this is actually fake I guess

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.590 
but this is actually fake I guess
because<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.799> no<00:01:08.430> crates<00:01:08.880> or

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
because there's there are no crates or

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.070 
because there's there are no crates or
perhaps<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> can't<00:01:12.900> see

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
perhaps I'm it is me because I can't see

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
perhaps I'm it is me because I can't see
them<00:01:14.000> yeah<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.210> probably<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.540> maybe<00:01:15.750> cuz<00:01:15.930> I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.610 
attacks from our enemies which is very
dumb<00:02:24.579> now<00:02:25.579> there's<00:02:26.390> no<00:02:26.629> gold<00:02:26.900> bolts<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.470> this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
dumb now there's no gold bolts in this

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.039 
dumb now there's no gold bolts in this
part<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.190> we<00:02:28.579> don't<00:02:28.790> have<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.030> hydro<00:02:29.840> pack

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
part but we don't have the hydro pack

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.369 
part but we don't have the hydro pack
installed<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.769> clanks<00:02:31.670> back<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:33.049> can<00:02:33.200> get

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
installed on clanks back so we can get

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.800 
installed on clanks back so we can get
it<00:02:33.530> now<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.549> had<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.910> do<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.180> level<00:02:35.540> again

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it now we had to do this level again

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.670 
it now we had to do this level again
later<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.640> will<00:02:37.790> see<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.750> can't<00:02:39.170> go<00:02:39.530> any

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
later you will see so you can't go any

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.020 
later you will see so you can't go any
further<00:02:39.860> here<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:42.579> we<00:02:43.579> can<00:02:43.700> get<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.030> one<00:02:44.209> out

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
further here so we can get this one out

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.059 
further here so we can get this one out
let<00:02:47.030> me<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.269> try<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.569> if<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:48.139> can<00:02:48.319> do<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.440> like

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
let me just try it if I can do that like

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.849 
let me just try it if I can do that like
short<00:02:49.400> cut<00:02:49.579> this<00:02:49.760> part<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.410> think<00:02:51.410> it's

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
short cut this part I think it's

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.960 
short cut this part I think it's
possible<00:02:52.069> but<00:02:54.220> no<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.250> can't<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:58.670> for

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
possible but no I can't I think for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.199 
possible but no I can't I think for
those<00:02:59.450> who<00:02:59.720> like<00:03:00.260> speedrun<00:03:00.859> state<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.090> that

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
those who like speedrun state to do that

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.320 
those who like speedrun state to do that
break<00:03:03.139> there

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
break there

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.910 
break there
I<00:03:04.390> think<00:03:05.110> it's<00:03:05.200> possible<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:07.590> it's<00:03:08.590> angeline

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
I think it's possible but it's angeline

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.480 
I think it's possible but it's angeline
it's<00:03:09.640> not<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:10.170> never<00:03:11.170> mind<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.620> don't<00:03:12.220> want

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
it's not really never mind I don't want

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.330 
it's not really never mind I don't want
