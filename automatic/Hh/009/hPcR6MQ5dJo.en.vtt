00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 It is obvious that Alice does not know how to ride a bicycle and become very instinctive very quickly 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.449
 But what do professionals do? Does the pedal take to the form of [how] art that they look so smooth? 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.709
 Well, here are some tips that will make you lead like a professional 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.060
 First up. We actually will do some backpedaling work not literally 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.999
 But metaphorically because a huge body of [research] including our own region has appeared in the pedals 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.989
 The pedal bottom does not make the bike pedal more efficient 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.849
 Now your body will naturally put energy on the pedals in the most effective way 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 So you do not have to think of the foot pedal in the circles there are times though [when] 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.779
 Automatically pull up on the pedals when you're jogging or maybe when you're hard-working in the saddle 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.199
 But the point is that it must be natural to do so when it comes to yours 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.619
 Nafs believe your rhythm is your body naturally 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.529
 Select the most efficient rhythm for you as it weighs the requirements for fast and slow muscle twitch fibers 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.449
 So do not try to change the speed you do with pedals because it is likely to be harmful 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 The only thing that will affect the efficiency of your pedal 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.399
 Is Your Muscle Efficient Now the efficiency of real muscle is determined only by genetics and training 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.970
 Not fully understood 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.139
 But what we do know is that some passengers do not need to use energy as much as a certain force, as with others 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.690
 It is not a true measure of performance 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.940
 There are no effective passengers are certainly not always fast and [opposite] 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.240
 So unless you have a lot of time available to you, we actually do not recommend focusing on it in training 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.289
 What? 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.219
 What will actually happen difference [in this case] Do not worry so there are a few small shortcuts to improve the pedal and out? 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 right Now 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.729
 Getting the right situation on your bike is 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.090
 Most vital 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.979
 An important part of [that] is the height of your saddle Now if we look at [spectrum] the extensive [of] riders in the professional peloton you will find 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.890
 There is a set of satellites that you prefer to different games 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.750
 But there is also a broad trend that is when you have got your feet at the bottom of the pedal 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.590
 You have a corner here and I 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.220
 About 25 to 30 degrees If you're more detailed, we have a great video of you here in the food [gCSe] 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 How perfect is your saddle height? 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.939
 After that, it is really important to keep your upper body steady when you exchange 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.549
 Excessive movement if your trunk, [not only] wasting energy is also a kind of bad 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.489
 Although some professionals practice rock and roll when exposed to pressure because there are too many bells, it happens at much higher speeds 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.549
 To achieve this on the one hand. It's just a state of focus to stay alive 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.750
 It is acquired behavior 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.569
 It takes a bit of practice, [but] it's easier for some riders than others, because of the underlying stability 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.039
 You can not fail to hear this tune from Yoga to Pilates 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.099
 A specific core force is working now 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.089
 Increase muscle strength stability at the bottom of the trunk 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.729
 It seems to help with things like back pain situation all kinds of this is true or not what we certainly know 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 [Cutter] With a strong core working very smoothly and often very strong as well, so it can benefit us all 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.079
 Do not stretch all the pros not through a long time actually is not very good at doing this big picture stuff 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.809
 But because time spent on their bikes 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.680
 They are likely to have a degree of flexibility that may be lacking 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.869
 We spend a lot of time sitting either for work or driving or snow and only when we relax? 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.500
 So actually do a little light stretch even if only 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.299
 When you are on the bike really help improve your pedal style not to mention your 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.429
 Efficiency and comfort where you will be able to access a fast and fast location on the bike 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.049
 Now there is little discussion about exactly what this does for you 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.139
 But the theory is that the foot pedal in place is therefore a high strength that helps to recruit muscle fibers and develop muscle and nerve muscles 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.480
 Pathways has always personally found this very enjoyable as a training tool and also very useful 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.690
 [Even] Although it has not yet been proven [in] the lab if you want to try it within five minutes of the pedal at 60 rpm 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.649
 The density is relatively high then the gear is easy for another [5] minutes and repeat 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.830
 Make sure you do this in climbing to keep resistance. So there you go to pedal like pro 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.750
 Do not do what you think you should focus instead on these five simple things 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.650
 Yes 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.600
 Set the height of the saddle Keep your upper body still some basic work Some flexibility work and also experience with some slow cadence drills 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.620
 The really nice shoes and quilts will also help [completely] 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.179
 Yes, if you want to see this video about how to adjust the height of your saddle and just click there to watch it [or] to 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.310
 Combining basic work and flexibility in the same exercises well we have a video about yoga for cyclists 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.910
 You can access it there just and make [sure] you know everything else is universal 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.200
 Biking videos make sure you're clicking on us 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.760
 If you click on the Pacific Ocean this will work - 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.680
 Not possible
