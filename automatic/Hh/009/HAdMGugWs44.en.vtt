00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
final score that was the only action in

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.570 
final score that was the only action in
this<00:04:45.450> pretty<00:04:45.690> tight<00:04:46.020> game<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:47.040> had<00:04:47.220> chances

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
this pretty tight game and I had chances

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.250 
to score he I think he had one or two
chances<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.070> score<00:04:50.310> but<00:04:50.850> 10<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.510> all<00:04:51.990> that

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260

will do just fine for the finals so

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.390 
will do just fine for the finals so
hopefully<00:05:27.810> she'll<00:05:28.320> manage<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.800> take<00:05:29.130> us<00:05:29.370> to

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
a pretty good passer and so it was a

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.570 
a pretty good passer and so it was a
little<00:05:58.470> bit<00:05:58.650> tough<00:05:58.950> in<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.460> beginning

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
little bit tough in the beginning

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.560 
little bit tough in the beginning
however<00:06:00.540> the<00:06:01.140> 352<00:06:01.680> kind<00:06:02.370> of<00:06:02.490> crushes<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.060> 442

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
however the 352 kind of crushes the 442

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.780 
however the 352 kind of crushes the 442
in<00:06:03.840> my<00:06:03.990> opinion<00:06:04.290> it's<00:06:04.620> because<00:06:05.130> as<00:06:05.310> soon<00:06:05.550> as

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
in my opinion it's because as soon as
