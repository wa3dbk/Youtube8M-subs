awhile well we've worked for the last 15
years<00:01:55.690> on<00:01:56.350> our<00:01:56.800> idea<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.460> making<00:01:57.670> amphibious

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
years on our idea of making amphibious

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.930 
years on our idea of making amphibious
vehicles<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.080> can<00:01:59.230> be<00:01:59.410> fast<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.430> land<00:02:00.460> and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
vehicles that can be fast on land and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.360 
vehicles that can be fast on land and
fast<00:02:01.480> on<00:02:01.690> water<00:02:01.870> and<00:02:02.290> change<00:02:02.710> between<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.190> two

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
fast on water and change between the two

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.550 
fast on water and change between the two
quickly<00:02:03.640> which<00:02:04.330> has<00:02:04.870> never<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.440> been

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
quickly which has never really been

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.280 
quickly which has never really been
successfully<00:02:06.370> done<00:02:06.550> before<00:02:07.170> tell<00:02:08.170> me<00:02:08.230> a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
successfully done before tell me a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.870 
successfully done before tell me a
little<00:02:08.350> bit<00:02:08.530> about<00:02:08.619> how<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.890> quad<00:02:09.220> ski<00:02:09.610> works

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
little bit about how the quad ski works

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.280 
little bit about how the quad ski works
because<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.450> matter<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.720> seconds<00:02:11.080> it<00:02:11.200> goes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
because in a matter of seconds it goes

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.870 
because in a matter of seconds it goes
from<00:02:11.500> land<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.860> sea<00:02:12.130> so<00:02:12.370> what<00:02:12.700> does<00:02:12.790> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
from land to sea so what does that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.020 
from land to sea so what does that
process<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:14.070> drive<00:02:15.070> into<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> water<00:02:15.550> until

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
process like drive into the water until

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.940 
process like drive into the water until
you're<00:02:16.180> floating<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:17.050> hold<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> brake<00:02:17.620> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you're floating you hold the brake and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.680 
you're floating you hold the brake and
press<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> button<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.910> can't<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
press a button so you can't have the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.420 
press a button so you can't have the
throttle<00:02:19.930> long<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.470> wheels<00:02:20.620> retract<00:02:21.160> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
throttle long the wheels retract and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.760 
throttle long the wheels retract and
then<00:02:22.210> when<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> stops<00:02:23.110> beeping<00:02:23.470> you're<00:02:23.620> good

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
then when it stops beeping you're good

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.200 
then when it stops beeping you're good
to<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.220> hammer<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.790> throttle<00:02:25.120> or

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
to go you can hammer on the throttle or

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:35.370 
to go you can hammer on the throttle or
you<00:02:25.450> take<00:02:25.600> like<00:02:25.780> jetski

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380

I<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:35.680> just<00:02:35.980> on<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.310> land<00:02:36.790> going<00:02:37.150> 45<00:02:37.570> miles<00:02:38.020> an

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
I was just on the land going 45 miles an

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.640 
I was just on the land going 45 miles an
hour<00:02:38.440> around<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.790> sandy<00:02:40.300> track<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.380> now<00:02:41.560> I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
hour around a sandy track and now I'm

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.850 
hour around a sandy track and now I'm
just<00:02:41.800> out<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.610> channel

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
just out here in this channel

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.560 
just out here in this channel
really<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.520> stable<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.060> mean<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.420> get<00:02:46.510> a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
really is stable I mean you can get a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.460 
really is stable I mean you can get a
nice<00:02:46.750> little<00:02:47.020> bit<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.320> lean

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
nice little bit of lean

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.320 
nice little bit of lean
I'm<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.890> take<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.280> sharp<00:02:49.640> but

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.839 

whoo

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.170 

Hey

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610 

so<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.720> thing<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.049> interesting<00:03:05.200> about

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
so one thing that's interesting about

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.789 
so one thing that's interesting about
the<00:03:05.950> throttle<00:03:06.670> there's<00:03:07.090> no<00:03:07.269> gears<00:03:07.599> here<00:03:07.900> what

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the throttle there's no gears here what

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.100 
the throttle there's no gears here what
happens<00:03:09.189> is<00:03:09.400> once<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.090> wheels<00:03:10.329> pop<00:03:10.689> up<00:03:10.930> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
happens is once the wheels pop up and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.539 
happens is once the wheels pop up and
decouple<00:03:11.379> from<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.799> engine<00:03:12.159> it

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
decouple from the engine it

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.460 
decouple from the engine it
automatically<00:03:13.329> shifts<00:03:13.629> into<00:03:13.900> third<00:03:14.230> gear

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
automatically shifts into third gear

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.589 
automatically shifts into third gear
which<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:15.010> decided<00:03:15.579> as<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> premium<00:03:16.180> or

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
which they have decided as a premium or

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.250 
which they have decided as a premium or
optimum<00:03:17.110> gear<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.970> first<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.599> like<00:03:19.810> this

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
optimum gear so at first I was like this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.319 
optimum gear so at first I was like this
isn't<00:03:20.470> very<00:03:20.799> fun<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.760> said<00:03:21.939> give<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.120> more

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
isn't very fun and I said give it more

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.020 
isn't very fun and I said give it more
gas<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.200> said<00:03:23.470> okay<00:03:24.189> this<00:03:24.220> still<00:03:24.579> isn't<00:03:24.730> fun

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
gas and I said okay this still isn't fun

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.050 
gas and I said okay this still isn't fun
and<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.390> say<00:03:25.540> go<00:03:25.659> all<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.049> way

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
and they say go all the way

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.110 
and they say go all the way
now<00:03:28.180> we're<00:03:28.510> having<00:03:28.750> fun

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.949 

one<00:03:32.120> thing<00:03:32.300> that's<00:03:32.450> great<00:03:32.629> about<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
one thing that's great about the

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.720 
one thing that's great about the
construction<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.400> hull

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
construction of this is that the hull

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.180 
construction of this is that the hull
which<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.269> one<00:03:35.750> piece<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.140> composite<00:03:36.709> is

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
which is one piece of composite is

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.550 
which is one piece of composite is
actually<00:03:37.519> two<00:03:37.730> layers<00:03:37.900> there's<00:03:38.900> composite

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
actually two layers there's composite

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.860 
actually two layers there's composite
foam<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.069> composite<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.879> that's<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.690> if

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
foam and composite and that's so if

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.869 
foam and composite and that's so if
you're<00:03:42.019> out<00:03:42.170> on<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.410> track<00:03:42.800> or<00:03:43.129> you're<00:03:43.370> going

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
you're out on the track or you're going

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.460 
you're out on the track or you're going
through<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.120> woods<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.959> end<00:03:45.050> up<00:03:45.140> scraping

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
through the woods you end up scraping

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.170 
through the woods you end up scraping
the<00:03:45.830> underside<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.670> still<00:03:46.879> get<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
the underside you can still get in the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.360 
the underside you can still get in the
water<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.690> not<00:03:47.810> sink<00:03:48.250> something<00:03:49.250> I

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
water and not sink something I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.210 
water and not sink something I
appreciate<00:03:49.970> not<00:03:50.959> sinking

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.190 

so<00:03:58.820> obviously<00:03:59.180> this<00:03:59.300> vehicle<00:03:59.720> serves<00:03:59.960> two

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
so obviously this vehicle serves two

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.560 
so obviously this vehicle serves two
distinct<00:04:00.650> purposes<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:01.700> not<00:04:01.850> strictly<00:04:02.390> an

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
distinct purposes it's not strictly an

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.180 
distinct purposes it's not strictly an
ATV<00:04:03.020> or<00:04:03.050> a<00:04:03.290> jetski<00:04:03.740> what<00:04:03.980> are<00:04:04.070> some

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
ATV or a jetski what are some

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.400 
ATV or a jetski what are some
compromises<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.030> guys<00:04:05.150> had<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.480> make<00:04:05.720> for<00:04:06.290> it

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
compromises you guys had to make for it

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.590 
compromises you guys had to make for it
to<00:04:06.530> work<00:04:06.710> in<00:04:06.860> both<00:04:07.010> worlds<00:04:07.460> as<00:04:07.730> far<00:04:08.030> as<00:04:08.240> the

aspect<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.980> this<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.220> really<00:04:31.430> interesting

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
aspect of this is really interesting

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.360 
aspect of this is really interesting
because<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:32.270> guys<00:04:32.420> had<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.770> package<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:34.010> much

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
because you guys had to package a much

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.060 
because you guys had to package a much
smaller<00:04:34.790> much<00:04:35.120> lighter<00:04:35.510> jet<00:04:36.050> than<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.650> on<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
smaller much lighter jet than is on the

smaller much lighter jet than is on the
market<00:04:37.400> one<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.850> reasons<00:04:38.210> we<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.570> the

market one of the reasons we have the
engine<00:04:39.200> we<00:04:39.380> do<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.860> BMW<00:04:40.640> K<00:04:41.090> 1300<00:04:41.780> rate<00:04:41.990> is

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
engine we do the BMW K 1300 rate is

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.200 
engine we do the BMW K 1300 rate is
because<00:04:42.860> it's<00:04:43.010> one<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.340> best<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:43.850> terms<00:04:43.880> of

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
because it's one of the best in terms of

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.150 
because it's one of the best in terms of
power-to-weight<00:04:44.600> ratio<00:04:45.230> in<00:04:45.350> its<00:04:45.500> class<00:04:45.740> and

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
power-to-weight ratio in its class and

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.770 
power-to-weight ratio in its class and
we<00:04:46.430> need<00:04:46.580> some<00:04:46.850> things<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.270> can<00:04:47.450> convert

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
we need some things that can convert

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.540 
we need some things that can convert
that<00:04:47.840> without<00:04:48.290> giving<00:04:48.620> us<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.860> lot<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.190> extra

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
that without giving us a lot of extra

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.880 
that without giving us a lot of extra
weight<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:49.760> carry<00:04:50.150> we<00:04:50.840> had<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.170> design<00:04:51.320> our<00:04:51.860> own

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
weight to carry we had to design our own

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.490 
weight to carry we had to design our own
jet<00:04:52.520> unit<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.240> would<00:04:53.420> be<00:04:53.630> shorter<00:04:54.320> and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
jet unit that would be shorter and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.800 
jet unit that would be shorter and
lighter<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:56.000> there<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.270> thought<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.540> maybe

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
lighter is there a thought of maybe

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.870 
lighter is there a thought of maybe
going<00:04:57.020> electric<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.890> we've<00:04:58.040> got<00:04:58.220> no<00:04:58.400> problem

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
going electric that we've got no problem

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.880 
going electric that we've got no problem
with<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.570> idea<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.990> being<00:05:00.200> electric<00:05:00.650> in<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
with the idea of being electric in the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.860 
with the idea of being electric in the
future<00:05:01.220> but<00:05:01.400> we<00:05:01.670> need<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.090> choose<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.419> best

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
future but we need to choose the best

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.080 
future but we need to choose the best
available<00:05:03.740> power<00:05:03.919> plan<00:05:04.280> we<00:05:04.490> can<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:04.940> gives

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
available power plan we can that gives

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.210 
available power plan we can that gives
us<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> best<00:05:05.450> power<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.930> rate<00:05:06.110> at<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.830> moment

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
us the best power to rate at the moment

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.710 
us the best power to rate at the moment
there<00:05:07.580> aren't<00:05:07.730> any<00:05:07.790> electric<00:05:08.270> engines<00:05:08.630> that

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
there aren't any electric engines that

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.189 
there aren't any electric engines that
can<00:05:08.900> do<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.230> so<00:05:09.500> we're<00:05:09.919> with<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.160> BMW

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
can do that so we're with the BMW

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.010
