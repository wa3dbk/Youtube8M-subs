00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.230
 huge hello to all dear friends with 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.529
 you have one for me came another 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.270
 package from aliexpress shop if 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.050
 to be exact then this is my very 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.900
 first order but he came to my account 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.670
 far from the first and somehow here came 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.210
 first time to this site and say so 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.210
 fool ordered himself immediately parcel away 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.730
 not the cheapest one I planned 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.950
 you know what to start to somehow 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.500
 securing yourself is worth going to order and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.570
 cheaper well only the cheapest and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.710
 see whether the units will come to some 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.720
 delay and so on and then you can 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.190
 order that they are more expensive but I decided 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.329
 go a different way and today we already have 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.899
 I know it's because I was tracking 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.870
 order and so to speak carefully for him 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.170
 watched because he didn't come far 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.440
 the first of them as I repeat has a 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.960
 To be honest, a little wary 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.689
 just a little bit and so therefore i'm so 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.100
 watched intently 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:12.700
 watched up packed again here's how 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 the Chinese love 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.659
 a little package which, in principle, is also loved 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.659
 it will be easier for him 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.340
 deduction as too much 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.060
 either all nafig tear either by accident 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.650
 I will put an improvised device which 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.320
 holding a phone 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.810
 which case it takes me and therefore 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 how is it going not very good yes 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:55.060
 guys gift wrap first and 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:02:03.729
 there we are waiting for a laser pointer charger 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:05.950
 device key strange should have 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.660
 still be the battery where the battery is already returned 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.550
 and before the battery is waiting for us inside 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.739
 the idea is that the battery should be right here 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.470
 but for some reason the Chinese decided to put me 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.090
 and immediately inside in general guys are green 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.270
 laser pointer 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.989
 I will add here to be described 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.060
 its power is not written 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:30.209
 tune in I know you can yes that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.209
 there is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.010
 see basically everything 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.140
 wavelength and see but duma guys just 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.270
 later did not about a specific review but 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.750
 the main thing is that it went guys unusual 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.180
 grain pointer this laser pointer can 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.610
 burn paper and even 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.870
 experiment with the cardboard and she 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.390
 sets fire to matches 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.790
 there is a lot of video on the Internet 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:08.010
 so we have where where indicated plus 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:11.590
 where is the minus and in the old fashion we try 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.420
 it is not written here just because you have it 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:21.420
 you will not turn on the key 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:25.150
 which will turn a handful to return which 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.860
 that is, it was already on me 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.260
 that is, you see yes with a nozzle that is 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:41.380
 there nasadochka we have what we have 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:43.480
 still learn to tune so here i am 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.540
 This I in short overdid not the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:53.739
 cool I needed to be honest 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:58.180
 too no i honestly don't understand that what 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.980
 it changes that this twist we explain yet 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.920
 I will understand to be honest, not all 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:08.950
 Immediately and this is not completely 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:13.660
 unscrews this focusing guns like 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.390
 it was yes well something like that from general 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.570
 unscrews yes that's just us 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.560
 unscrewed and we get up 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:28.960
 full clean 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:31.210
 ray he is very enough in the eyes 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.660
 naturally they do not shine because it 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.200
 may sadly end but we 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.280
 let's experiment but guys are very very 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.229
 bright very bright shines at all that is 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.950
 even here my phone is clear to us 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.910
 shows very bright in me even the eyes 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.520
 a little blinds guys at all bright 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.980
 Well, I'll be messing with her a little more than how 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.670
 just messing around 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.090
 experiment what she is capable of 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.350
 on the little thing cool and cost us no 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.690
 16 dollars or something 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.060
 together here are quite a charger and 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.480
 so on you can find cheaper but in what 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.910
 trouble cheaper copies in them to you 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.560
 just may not put either charger 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.830
 device that comes here 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.500
 by the way on it and sockets everything is fine 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.060
 she is universal by the way yes but 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.310
 universal ie all sizes 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.460
 batteries are not even necessary for this 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.190
 kind of battery and laser pointer itself 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.110
 with a battery that i will tell you very much and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.370
 very nice so of course put 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.980
 like subscribe to the channel good luck to you 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.660
 but I turn if you want of course 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.930
 write in the comments so I wrote 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.250
 review on this thing will you this 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:52.150
