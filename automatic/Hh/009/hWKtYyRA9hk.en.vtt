00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 i 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.580
 hello welcome today I'm here with 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.340
 link to tell them about my favorites 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.920
 April wants to start with something for hair 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.870
 This is a brand with mask 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550
 frida of the suisse line and is that 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.080
 basically promises how to control the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.780
 frizz and that you but not so 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.730
 fluffy about their little ones 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.440
 sticks that are left by the static 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 I do not think I do much but I do believe that 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.699
 It helps me that my hair is not so 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.300
 spongy and taras and the lion king 'like 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.149
 that is much more controlled and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 unraveled pretty well leaves shine 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 soft super good I liked a lot of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.970
 done today I finished it lasted me 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 approximately three weeks 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.260
 proportionally it's expensive because this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.540
 it only brings 150 ml and it comes out 4500 pesos 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.340
 what lasted me three weeks then yes 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.130
 you had longer hair because that I 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.440
 I have a little hair and not so long 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.210
 maybe it would be a lot more although I 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.620
 I fit it in industrial quantities but 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 I would buy it anyway 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.580
 because this moment I think that's what 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.550
 more it takes me to lower the volume of my 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 hair and without leaving it heavy you find it 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 in smoked pharmacies and also in de 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.230
 bs and I think not in yumbo I love you 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.020
 talk about this make-up remover 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.690
 the ethical brand that is super similar to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.760
 vannes away from the bank that little tin 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.920
 what comes is basically Vaseline 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.550
 it's like an ointment then you passed it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.280
 Through your eyes you make a gentle massage and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.050
 like breaking the layers of the mask 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 of eyelash the makeup takes it out and then 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.400
 you remove the balance wey to me what not 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.050
 I like it is that as dirty the format 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
 because to make a can as they lower their 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 being the product instead this to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.890
 come as in starting ointment the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 texture is much more homogeneous is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 much more comfortable to work in more 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.210
 clean and I imagine it is much more 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
 economic brings 60 grams and to me 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.000
 it works excellent taking out in masks 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.580
 of waterproof eyelashes 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.830
 is the way quickly became my 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.200
 favorite is mascara I bought it as for 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.710
 try simply and I loved it is the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.360
 number 124 burgo which is a very color 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.920
 autumnal that you must have already seen 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.050
 even in case my videos because 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.720
 it came out in the case of autumn whitney in 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.600
 the favorites in the lipsticks for this 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.670
 season is a dark color a little bit 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.820
 coffee but that does not get to be seen as well 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.340
 chocolate or giving whole 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.770
 I love dark super good has 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630
 a good duration does not have flashes is 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.090
 like the normal creamy finish and also 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.330
 it's very economical so I'm very 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.430
 happy with this skin 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.800
 and the last favorites are a little 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.780
 more expensive one is the high being the 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.180
 benefit this product the truth that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.770
 take your time and not serving 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.380
 because it's there because people do so 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.740
 all of him is an illuminator in cream like 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.290
 of a pink color is a rather cold if 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.750
 he is rather cold and they have not 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 found the big thing because many 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.440
 sometimes I forgot to apply it I like 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.330
 apply this before the powder was applied 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.100
 the correcting base and then there is in the 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.080
 Illuminator I put it with a few taps 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.780
 in the highest part of my cheekbones and what 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.090
 blurred, I advise you to apply it 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.710
 side blur and then the other because it 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.630
 it dries pretty fast and once it 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.980
 not how difuminarlo dry and you do not 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.610
 you want to stay with a line there 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 luminous looks so natural it's like 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.790
 if your skin was like that with that shine 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.400
 naturally as being born from within 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.830
 out as well as a thing almost 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.050
 mystical unlike the illuminators 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.700
 in powder that look as if it shows as 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.050
 makeup look cute I love them 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.810
 the illuminators but I think this is 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.980
 much more natural is fast is perfect 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 for day to day so we are 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.349
 giving a lot during this month 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.230
 and finally this first for lips of 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.780
 max that I did not ask if you saw 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.280
 my video of purchases of more the order 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.409
 some things to my sister from panama 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.599
 because already much cheaper and this was coming 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.060
 first I did not ask him I do not know how 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.439
 it came good they can sell I told ya 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 many of you told me it was 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.409
 super good so the time I'm going 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.049
 to keep and pay it 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.419
 I'm going to try it and it's really good 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.900
 and I got busy with economic lipsticks 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.609
 and if it makes it much more even 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.000
 last longer than have a better fixation 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.860
 even if you eat or drink water or what 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 it has some color left 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.940
 it is perfect but if it remains 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.210
 notably in better conditions than 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.530
 if you did not use this first one is a bar 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.260
 white but it is totally 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.970
 transparent feels like similar to a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.030
 lip balm and then apply your 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.220
 lipstick normally and it's like something else 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.720
 a much more professional finish this 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.460
 they were my April favorites I hope that 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.169
 has been useful for you and also 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.789
 comment on which were your favorites

 hello girls welcome today I come to you 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.650

 about those little hairs that 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.600
 they had for the static and that's for sure
