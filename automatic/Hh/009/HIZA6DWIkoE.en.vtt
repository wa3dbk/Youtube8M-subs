00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.900
 well we are demonstrating how it is done 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.610
 the installation of the windows 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040
 [Music] 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.250
 previously we have already defined a 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.630
 template 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 in wood which we have 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.160
 screw 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160
 to the van 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.320
 4 points 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.780
 we have proceeded to mark it 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.870
 now the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.640
 that 's the way we're scratching it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.629
 dismantle 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 you really do not want 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.260
 We are making the sample the test 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.020
 practice with 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.729
 our own unit 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.729
 it has been marked 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.560
 the position of the window 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.940
 now we are going to clean it 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.750
 to get the brand we made with the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 feather 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.450
 [Music] 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.860
 now we proceed to do 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.280
 already about three times three 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.280
 centimeters of the brand 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.739
 now we plug in 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.739
 our tool 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.930
 [Music] 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.930
 and now we proceed 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.320
 [Music] 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.780
 to appreciate 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.280
 the short machine 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.870
 Y 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.700
 [Music] 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.010
 it is affirmed 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.840
 ideal this work should be done with two 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.240
 people so that one hold the can 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.480
 and the other can correctly address the 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.480
 why 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.340
 and we proceeded to cut a window 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:02.590
 if you notice 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.590
 the cut is almost perfect 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:11.630
 leaves direct termination 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.240
 you do not have to go through cans 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.860
 do not want to edge 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.710
 [Music] 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.710
 and we do the practical test a bit 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.480
 Now that we have cut the can we 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:31.170
 to continue to remove the silicone that 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.170
 they have the separation 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.229
 then the rubber does not come together 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.390
 and there we have the 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.390
 the rubber stained with silver
