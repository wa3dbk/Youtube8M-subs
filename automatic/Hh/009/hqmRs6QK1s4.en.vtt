 there for those who enjoy this classic style 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.029
 It's game so the first one is the lamb 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.710
 2 you control is an android 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.250
 it has some magnetic powers 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.439
 so interesting game and despite 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.080
 be a 2d platform game 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.730
 the game's graphics are in 3D 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 basically you have commands as well 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.460
 simple how to go forward or backward 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.219
 and the skip button and a15 button 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 command that it appears is in accordance with 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.780
 the need as to what causes this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.539
 hook then you can shoot objects 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 place furniture if you hang according to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.469
 with the need and with the game did 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.079
 this command 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 so you can solve is also things 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 on the way puzzle to achieve 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 reach the end of the phase 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.110
 You have rope and the maximum of stars and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 in the end when you complete it says 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 How many if you can 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.080
 consensus biggest stars you have a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.979
 As long as you comply you gain one 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.229
 bonus 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.729
 another very cool game that is batman 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.520
 in an indy game 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 then it is of independent study that he 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 has a very interesting graph that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 You see, he moves a lot with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.240
 this colorful background game and in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.579
 front is all at the base in the shadows not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.290
 It will contract in nice and you will 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.590
 control this creature you touch 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.299
 screen for her to fly and then you let her go 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.549
 decreases so you will control in the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.750
 height and on the way you can 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.640
 capture some fruits that with you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.830
 can see can generate a clone can do 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.250
 grow can not make network 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.990
 so this is going to be messing up or 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.910
 helping you is to continue in the phase and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.680
 the scenario will destroy will trying is 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.440
 destroy your character do not dodge 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.570
 of all falling objects is 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.070
 during the way so play is very 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.880
 interesting a brave a good graphic 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.520
 Nice and there is a simple game and command 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.100
 but at the same time the difficult game because 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.980
 you can not see the screen goes around and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.010
 you stay if you get stuck in some 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 object and even accompanies it and where the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.760
 your character you end up being crushed 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.190
 you lose the game 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.970
 You can see there is very interesting and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.560
 button in another cool here metroid 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.620
 What is a futuristic game? 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.590
 only he has graphics them graphics 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.480
 classic to the era of super nintendo 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.550
 so it's because nostalgic people like it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.100
 these games in this special style but 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.190
 by the music of the game with music 8 bits 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.100
 So you guys are going to enjoy it a lot. 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.840
 is this game here a metroid basically 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.030
 you have two left side buttons one 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.650
 to go forward and another to go back and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.190
 here on the right you have one 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.830
 jump and the other to shoot to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 destroy the enemies were basically the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.390
 It comes down to that and then you go. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.000
 advancing the scenario will have makes question 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.370
 up others down a few moments 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.890
 is come several enemies of peace and defeat 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.050
 Do you have a helper that connects her? 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.420
 in the neighbor that is also destroying the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.240
 friends together with you and in the end you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.760
 has a boy knows where you have to 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.710
 defeat it with several different types 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.640
 there are some that are more challenging than 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.340
 others 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.770
 so he owns that bar is from there 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.860
 that is the reduced being the enemy is 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.620
 destroyed and at this moment also your 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.550
 helper there he shoots the free 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.280
 when he also helps against Boston 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.790
 Then you can get back from points in your 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.130
 board there on ufrgs has another interesting 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.220
 I check shorts strongly reminiscent of the 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.680
 classic games and platform then you 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.360
 can find several reference 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.670
 leave for example the super Mario 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.420
 not for those who like this style of 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.000
 game is going to enjoy a lot is very simple but 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.430
 Let's see if there are four commands on the side 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.960
 left you can forward and back 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.320
 here on the right you use a button 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.060
 popular red and uses blue to 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 crouch then goes under 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.100
 objects there and on the way you have to 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.050
 save your enemies who have been 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.240
 identified and collecting coins then 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 but if you manage to rebuild this 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.020
 score and the three stars at 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.030
 maximum score of the game and another very 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.200
 interesting is that it is very successful and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.650
 great ms 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.140
 It's a game there. It's very funny, he has. 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.240
 interesting graphic and he had 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.210
 very cool physics game then ever 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.970
 They do pirouettes there with Grandma and you have 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.270
 to rescue the apples that were stolen 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.850
 there the thief and on the way 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.580
 Collect as many stars as you can 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.050
 get a higher score 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.960
 So you and for example it is a maneuver 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.850
 you lose the stars you got 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.250
 You have to get there before him in there. 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.370
 end then a racing game is 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.030
 pirouettes on the way is very cool and oms 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.880
 garbage and when you finish there phase 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.870
 he shows the apples you got is 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.759
 how many coins and he shows a review of 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.919
 your course that you did in that style 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.940
 A little retro then it's very cool the game 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.729
 there 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.949
 Well that's it there were 15 tips here from 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.650
 all style games cell 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.289
 platform is remembering that this is the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.440
 only one that is paid the others are free 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.690
 so you can check have the links in 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.130
 description of the video and if you liked 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.199
 video, do not forget I did not like that 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.210
