hey<00:00:01.560> guys<00:00:02.040> welcome<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.970> episode<00:00:03.090> number<00:00:04.009> 185

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
hey guys welcome to episode number 185

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.240 
hey guys welcome to episode number 185
today's<00:00:06.029> tank<00:00:06.390> tip<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.960> day<00:00:07.290> late<00:00:07.500> but<00:00:08.220> I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
today's tank tip is a day late but I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.160 
today's tank tip is a day late but I
wanted<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.730> talk<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.510> product<00:00:09.809> right

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
wanted to talk about this product right

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.669 
wanted to talk about this product right
here<00:00:10.530> just<00:00:11.070> called<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.400> uniseal<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.290> these<00:00:13.290> are

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
here just called a uniseal and these are

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.090 
here just called a uniseal and these are
actually<00:00:14.280> used<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.969> curved<00:00:15.509> surfaces<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
actually used on curved surfaces and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.130 
actually used on curved surfaces and
they<00:00:17.670> replace<00:00:18.180> bulkheads

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
they replace bulkheads

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.800 
they replace bulkheads
so<00:00:19.650> obviously<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.490> bulkhead<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.240> fairly

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so obviously a bulkhead is fairly

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.160 
so obviously a bulkhead is fairly
familiar<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.650> basically<00:00:23.250> everyone<00:00:23.840> you<00:00:24.840> use

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
familiar to basically everyone you use

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.009 
familiar to basically everyone you use
it<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.650> create<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.460> watertight<00:00:27.060> seal<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.960> your

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it to create a watertight seal on your

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.700 
it to create a watertight seal on your
tanks<00:00:28.800> great<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.820> flat<00:00:30.060> surfaces<00:00:30.710> glass

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
tanks great for flat surfaces glass

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.490 
tanks great for flat surfaces glass
acrylic<00:00:32.360> you've<00:00:33.360> seen<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.809> you've<00:00:34.200> used

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
acrylic you've seen them you've used

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.670 
acrylic you've seen them you've used
them<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.070> love<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:35.750> but<00:00:36.750> curved<00:00:37.110> surfaces

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
them you love them but curved surfaces

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
them you love them but curved surfaces
are<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.399> difficult<00:00:38.879> for

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
are a little bit more difficult for

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.930 
are a little bit more difficult for
small<00:00:40.290> holes<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> 1/2<00:00:41.129> inch<00:00:41.399> hole<00:00:41.640> or

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
small holes like a 1/2 inch hole or

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.010 
small holes like a 1/2 inch hole or
maybe<00:00:42.180> even<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.050> 1<00:00:43.260> inch<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.460> most

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
maybe even up to 1 inch at the very most

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.889 
maybe even up to 1 inch at the very most
on<00:00:46.100> curved<00:00:47.100> surfaces<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:48.090> could<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.780> away

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
on curved surfaces you could get away

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
on curved surfaces you could get away
with<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> bulkhead<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> unit<00:00:51.059> seal<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
with a bulkhead but a unit seal is a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.689 
with a bulkhead but a unit seal is a
much<00:00:51.600> better<00:00:51.750> option

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
much better option

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.119 
much better option
it's<00:00:54.000> basically<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:55.230> solid<00:00:55.829> piece<00:00:55.860> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it's basically one solid piece of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.240 
it's basically one solid piece of
plastic<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.090> drill<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> hole<00:00:57.800> larger<00:00:58.800> than<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
plastic you drill a hole larger than the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670 
plastic you drill a hole larger than the
uniseal<00:00:59.699> itself<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> three<00:01:01.469> inch

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
uniseal itself this is like a three inch

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.759 
uniseal itself this is like a three inch
drill<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.140> then<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> lube<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
drill bit and then you have to lube it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520 
drill bit and then you have to lube it
up<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:05.729> soap<00:01:05.970> water<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.409> then<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
up with some soap water and then you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
up with some soap water and then you
stick<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.729> hole<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.600> your

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
stick it into the the hole in your

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.910 
stick it into the the hole in your
curved<00:01:10.350> surface<00:01:10.880> such<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.060> barrel<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.920> then

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
curved surface such as a barrel and then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.350 
curved surface such as a barrel and then
you're<00:01:14.189> basically<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you're basically good to go you can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.679 
you're basically good to go you can
shove<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.990> pipe<00:01:16.229> directly<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
shove your pipe directly into it so like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.660 
shove your pipe directly into it so like
here's<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> 2<00:01:19.170> inch<00:01:19.350> pipe<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.520> go

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here's a 2 inch pipe and that would go

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
here's a 2 inch pipe and that would go
into<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.090> 2<00:01:21.330> inch<00:01:21.509> uniseal<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
into this 2 inch uniseal and just the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
into this 2 inch uniseal and just the
pressure<00:01:23.640> alone<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.049> difficult

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
pressure alone because it's so difficult

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.770 
pressure alone because it's so difficult
to<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> pipe<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.000> uniseal<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
to get the pipe into the uniseal the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
to get the pipe into the uniseal the
pressure<00:01:28.049> alone<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.619> what's<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> make

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pressure alone is what's going to make

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
pressure alone is what's going to make
the<00:01:29.850> seal<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.530> simpler<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.159> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the seal so it's much simpler than a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
the seal so it's much simpler than a
bulkhead<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.200> no<00:01:34.409> parts<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
bulkhead there are really no parts to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.660 
bulkhead there are really no parts to
crack<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.880> break<00:01:36.290> no<00:01:37.290> threads<00:01:37.710> involved<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
crack or break no threads involved and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
crack or break no threads involved and
these<00:01:39.540> things<00:01:39.840> actually<00:01:40.110> hold<00:01:40.560> up

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
these things actually hold up

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340 
these things actually hold up
surprisingly<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> be

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
surprisingly well so I'm going to be

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
surprisingly well so I'm going to be
making<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.950> 55-gallon<00:01:44.700> Skippy<00:01:45.509> filter<00:01:45.869> here

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
making a 55-gallon Skippy filter here

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.050 
making a 55-gallon Skippy filter here
pretty<00:01:46.259> soon<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.710> instead<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
pretty soon and instead of using a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.530 
pretty soon and instead of using a
bulkhead

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bulkhead

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
bulkhead
I'm<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.290> ahead<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.710> use<00:01:49.829> some<00:01:49.860> unit

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I'm going to go ahead and use some unit

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.310 
I'm going to go ahead and use some unit
seals<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:51.000> two<00:01:51.210> inch<00:01:51.420> uniseal<00:01:51.869> because

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
seals I got two inch uniseal because

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
seals I got two inch uniseal because
they<00:01:52.500> seem<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.759> best<00:01:53.939> bang<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.329> your

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
they seem like the best bang for your

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
they seem like the best bang for your
buck<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> move<00:01:55.259> quite<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> water

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
buck they can move quite a bit of water

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
buck they can move quite a bit of water
but<00:01:56.579> anyways<00:01:56.939> guys<00:01:56.969> hope<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> learned<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
but anyways guys hope you learned a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
but anyways guys hope you learned a
little<00:01:58.259> something<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.920> I'll<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.670> guys
