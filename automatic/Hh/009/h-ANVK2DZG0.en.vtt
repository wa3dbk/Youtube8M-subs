00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.900
 house that is your house 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.809

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.179
 If you are very proud are the numbers for 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.970
 a party what is important and what I want 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.810
 that you learn here is the technique of how 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.490
 paint on blackboard as if they were hits and 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.619
 I invite you to subscribe to our

 channel please and your hands to the work 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.970
 because there is so much to do this is the 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.320
 material with which we will work 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:37.470
 We have vinyl paint and paint for 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.590
 blackboard then we have these lecterns 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.480
 they are very tiny and these tablets that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 I bought them in fantasies Miguel 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.130
 we are also going to use a pencil 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.900
 a marker of these like wax 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.880
 white a pencil a brush here and the 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.670
 I have ready and painted so that 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.490
 we can work faster I painted the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.270
 semi sexy white lectern more looks very 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.880
 nice and this I have it in color 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.590
 chalkboard that goes with this new fashion 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.840
 of the blackboard and aouate that the other day 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 we painted a pot like that of basil 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520
 then I discovered especially after 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.160
 an event that good numbers are 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.650
 they did all the engravings all 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.600
 ugly then I'll tell you everything 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.440
 explain I do not want you to miss anything 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.960
 because it was very very interesting here if 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.650
 you notice I already have a pencil 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.670
 the number first we will trace it with 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.670
 the pencil d 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:46.030
 for jon with a pincelito 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.030
 I gave him the color 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.580
 what do you wait for it to dry and turn it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.580
 to detail a little 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.690

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.450
