the<00:02:52.710> only<00:02:52.890> thing<00:02:53.070> I'm<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.490> worried<00:02:53.760> about

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
the only thing I'm really worried about

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.660 
the only thing I'm really worried about
is<00:02:54.180> his<00:02:54.870> shooting<00:02:55.410> because<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:56.400> i<00:02:56.430> use

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
is his shooting because when i use

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.220 
is his shooting because when i use
formations<00:02:57.330> like<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.570> with<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> left<00:02:58.020> mids

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
formations like this with the left mids

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.900 
formations like this with the left mids
and<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.440> right<00:02:58.680> meds<00:02:58.890> they<00:02:59.400> tend<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> get

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
and the right meds they tend to get

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.580 
and the right meds they tend to get
involved<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.780> more<00:03:01.020> than<00:03:01.080> they<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.500> with

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
involved a lot more than they do with

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.280 
involved a lot more than they do with
most<00:03:01.830> people<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.460> don't<00:03:02.520> know<00:03:02.700> what<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> do

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
most people like I don't know what I do

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.420 
most people like I don't know what I do
differently<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.350> other<00:03:04.500> people<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.250> seems

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
differently to other people but it seems

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.280 
differently to other people but it seems
like<00:03:05.490> my<00:03:05.700> left<00:03:05.940> mids<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.420> my<00:03:06.840> right<00:03:07.050> mids

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
like my left mids and my right mids

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.260 
like my left mids and my right mids
really<00:03:08.070> do<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.340> involved<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.970> game<00:03:09.150> and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
really do get involved in the game and

four<00:03:43.860> out<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.400> seven<00:03:44.610> games<00:03:45.000> which<00:03:45.239> really

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
four out of the seven games which really

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.990 
four out of the seven games which really
really<00:03:46.560> isn't<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.400> standard<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.940> I

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
really isn't up to standard that I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.790 
really isn't up to standard that I
really<00:03:48.330> wanted<00:03:48.540> like<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.930> past<00:03:49.290> two<00:03:49.470> teams

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800

really wanted like the past two teams
have<00:03:50.100> been<00:03:50.340> pretty<00:03:50.730> disappointed<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:52.200> how

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
have been pretty disappointed with how

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.590 
have been pretty disappointed with how
they've<00:03:52.739> played<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.370> I've<00:03:53.580> built<00:03:53.910> them<00:03:54.180> they

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
they've played like I've built them they

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.420 
they've played like I've built them they
look<00:03:54.810> amazing<00:03:55.170> I'm<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:55.920> happy<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.400> what

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
look amazing I'm really happy with what

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.310 
look amazing I'm really happy with what
I<00:03:56.580> built<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.480> i<00:03:57.570> play<00:03:57.780> with<00:03:57.959> them<00:03:58.080> and

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
I built and then i play with them and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.110 
I built and then i play with them and
they're<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.190> little<00:03:59.430> bit<00:03:59.520> disappointing

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
they're just a little bit disappointing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.210 
they're just a little bit disappointing
and<00:04:00.270> this<00:04:00.450> was<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> same<00:04:01.020> with<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:02.010> now

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
and this was the same with this to now

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.520 
and this was the same with this to now
it<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.940> good<00:04:03.239> like<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.630> think<00:04:04.020> it's<00:04:04.230> still

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
it was good like I think it's still

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.229 
it was good like I think it's still
really<00:04:04.800> good<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.489> fun<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.760> play<00:04:06.060> with

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
really good and it's fun to play with

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.050 
really good and it's fun to play with
considering<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.290> only<00:04:07.470> cost<00:04:07.890> me<00:04:07.980> 5<00:04:08.280> K<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.610> it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
considering it only cost me 5 K so it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.729 
considering it only cost me 5 K so it
might<00:04:09.450> be<00:04:09.480> worth<00:04:09.660> trying<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.260> because<00:04:10.560> there's

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
might be worth trying it because there's

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.160 
might be worth trying it because there's
literally<00:04:11.160> no<00:04:11.790> risk<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.420> you're<00:04:12.870> not<00:04:13.019> gonna

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
literally no risk like you're not gonna

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.949 
literally no risk like you're not gonna
lose<00:04:13.440> any<00:04:13.739> coins<00:04:14.280> by<00:04:14.970> buying<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.480> team<00:04:15.720> and

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
lose any coins by buying this team and

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.970 
lose any coins by buying this team and
you<00:04:16.019> might<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.320> some<00:04:16.470> good<00:04:16.590> luck<00:04:16.739> with<00:04:16.890> it

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
you might have some good luck with it

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.800 
you might have some good luck with it
like<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.609> might<00:04:17.820> be<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.299> decent<00:04:18.510> with<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
like you might be really decent with the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.690 
like you might be really decent with the
formation<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.380> me<00:04:19.560> personally<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.130> don't

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
formation but me personally I don't

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.430 
formation but me personally I don't
think<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.120> liked<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.480> like<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.750> really<00:04:22.229> didn't

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
think I liked it like I really didn't

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.900 
think I liked it like I really didn't
enjoy<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.800> formation<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.370> was<00:04:23.460> difficult<00:04:23.669> to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
enjoy the formation it was difficult to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.000 
enjoy the formation it was difficult to
pass<00:04:24.150> with<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.990> think<00:04:25.260> I'm<00:04:25.410> being<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.860> little

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
pass with and I think I'm being a little

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.550 
pass with and I think I'm being a little
bit<00:04:26.580> sloppy<00:04:26.880> with<00:04:27.060> my<00:04:27.270> general<00:04:27.750> play<00:04:28.020> style<00:04:28.380> at

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
bit sloppy with my general play style at

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.529 
bit sloppy with my general play style at
the<00:04:28.680> moment<00:04:29.070> because<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.520> don't<00:04:30.030> know<00:04:30.090> why<00:04:30.210> I'm

but<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.320> did<00:04:43.470> enjoy<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.950> games<00:04:44.160> like<00:04:44.430> like<00:04:44.669> I

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
but I did enjoy the games like like I

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.930 
but I did enjoy the games like like I
said<00:04:45.030> seven<00:04:45.810> games<00:04:45.990> four<00:04:46.440> wins<00:04:46.710> two<00:04:47.370> draws<00:04:47.400> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
said seven games four wins two draws and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.000 
said seven games four wins two draws and
a<00:04:47.970> loss<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.300> guess<00:04:48.479> that's<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.780> even<00:04:49.080> bad<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.740> I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
a loss I guess that's not even bad but I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.040 
a loss I guess that's not even bad but I
think<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.850> one<00:04:51.030> loss<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.690> which<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.840> this

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
think the one loss and get which is this

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.350 
think the one loss and get which is this
one<00:04:52.260> was<00:04:52.800> pretty<00:04:53.039> hefty<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.669> was<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.820> 5-2<00:04:54.240> loss

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
one was pretty hefty it was a 5-2 loss

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.420 
one was pretty hefty it was a 5-2 loss
in<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.600> end<00:04:54.630> I'm<00:04:54.990> gonna<00:04:55.260> give<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.560> team<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.919> 7

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
in the end I'm gonna give the team a 7

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.159 
in the end I'm gonna give the team a 7
out<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.640> 10<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.210> did<00:04:57.419> enjoy<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.720> for<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.960> most

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
out of 10 I did enjoy it for the most

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.320 
out of 10 I did enjoy it for the most
part<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.650> think<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:59.340> could<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.700> improved<00:05:00.060> I

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
part I think it could be improved I

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.420 
part I think it could be improved I
think<00:05:00.570> I'm<00:05:00.660> gonna<00:05:00.780> try<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.620> non<00:05:01.860> red<00:05:02.070> team<00:05:02.310> out

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
think I'm gonna try the non red team out

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.190 
think I'm gonna try the non red team out
