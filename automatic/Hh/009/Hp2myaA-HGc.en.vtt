00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.530

 complete underground and an extension 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 monumental 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 the crowd has thousands of characters 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 as a unique artificial intelligence and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 active they react to the players 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 and before other characters and that give a 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.190
 Deep feeling of immersion

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 benefit coordination is the key 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.909
 when you play with friends your murder in 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.830
 the air has freed me from being discovered 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.600
 Detection is an experience 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.409
 totally different and has a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.409
 different result 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.220
 to murder the guards to instigate 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.220
 the crowd to enter the palace by 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.080
 the force the numerous groups are in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.330
 actually one of the inhabitants of paris 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.399
 the rival factions fight for the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.240
 control in the bloody stories 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240
 of the French Revolution 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.660
 although we have entered the palace by 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.910
 the front door and two of our 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.220
 friends have found another entry and we 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.440
 they have helped just in time 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.180
 bwin it online experience and it reaches its 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.610
 best moment in those moments of 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.530
 synchronization to the sadd for a friend or 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.710
 avoid being detected or when entering 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.830
 open combat that is our goal 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.480
 is very protected we should continue 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.490
 touring the palace and waiting for 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.230
 best time to attack 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.180
 luckily a friend has used his 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.510
 ability to unlock doors and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.640
 open an alternative road in juniti 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.650
 you have different ways to execute your 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 strategy 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.670
 that freedom attached to the elements 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.890
 random as the guards the places 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.570
 the roads or the rewards that are 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.050
 They gave a unique experience in each 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.050
 departure 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.379
 pretty with the times 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.300
 that has been close to almost detect me 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.879
 those two guards but my friend I've 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.860
 intervened before I gave him back the 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.990
 please take care of the last one with my weapons 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.090
 and kilos to the ghost leaf 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.370
 this place is called the gardens of 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.670
 luxembourg is one of the many sites 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.770
 historical you'll see in the game from 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.110
 the cathedral of notre-dame to the dark 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.060
 tunnels of the catacombs visited 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.270
 Paris in a way you never had 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.270
 imagined 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:37.390
 bolt side 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.930
 now at the feasts of my judgment the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.930
 tree 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.710
 good 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.519
 playing with friends implies that combat 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.200
 is more intense cooperative and more 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.480
 challenging 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.970
 together you can cover larger areas 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.050
 plan to create a strategy and finish 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.050
 with greater threats 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.600
 do not 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.050
 and that's all I experienced the chaos of the 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:58.249
 French revolution with your friends 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.249
 beautiful signed up
