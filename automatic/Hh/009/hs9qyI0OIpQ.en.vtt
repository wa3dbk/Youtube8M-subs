00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.720
 playing here is a map must be left 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.410

 selection of 12 helicopters with 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 copper is then unlike a map 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.370
 like shanghai the 51 white maps what 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.080
 You hit the front of the hourglass. 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.070
 it is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.990

 Preferred with the doutô as I want 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.690

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.250
 in a superior duel although the team 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.799
 can at least improve a bit, right? 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.019
 the first match between the super young 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.690
