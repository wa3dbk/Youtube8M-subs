the cab and it forces this lever down
and<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.190> lever<00:00:56.489> has<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.940> fit<00:00:57.089> onto<00:00:57.269> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and this lever has to fit onto this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
and this lever has to fit onto this
little<00:00:57.839> post<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.409> that<00:00:58.729> spring-loaded<00:00:59.729> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
little post here that spring-loaded so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
little post here that spring-loaded so
that<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.440> engages<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.399> starter<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.089> then

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that it engages the starter and then

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
that it engages the starter and then
springs<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.940> don't<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.420> can

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
springs back and I don't think I can

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.190 
springs back and I don't think I can
hold<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.440> camera<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.840> because

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
hold the camera and put that on because

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.090 
hold the camera and put that on because
not<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.400> never<00:01:11.640> has<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.180> over<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.510> post

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
not that never has to go over that post

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.370 
not that never has to go over that post
and<00:01:14.100> take<00:01:14.340> both<00:01:14.520> hands<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.210> anyway<00:01:16.140> that's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and take both hands but anyway that's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:26.230 
and take both hands but anyway that's
the<00:01:16.560> idea<00:01:16.860> take<00:01:17.310> another<00:01:17.520> shot<00:01:17.760> once

flathead in it and he fell in love with
that<00:02:19.930> car<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.200> I'll<00:02:20.410> blame<00:02:20.650> him<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.430> he<00:02:21.610> just

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
that car and I'll blame him and he just

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.490

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
kind of lost interest in this old truck

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.490 
kind of lost interest in this old truck
so<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.100> could<00:02:24.970> see<00:02:25.180> here<00:02:25.540> he<00:02:25.930> had<00:02:26.080> cut<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
so you could see here he had cut the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.479 
so you could see here he had cut the
wires<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.690> was<00:02:28.690> ready<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.440> yank<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.010> engine

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
wires and was ready to yank this engine

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.930 
wires and was ready to yank this engine
and<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:31.150> me<00:02:31.620> he<00:02:32.620> probably<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.700> thought

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
and like me he probably just thought

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.360 
and like me he probably just thought
there<00:02:34.209> was<00:02:34.360> no<00:02:34.600> way<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.410> would<00:02:35.530> ever<00:02:35.739> run<00:02:36.070> or

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
there was no way it would ever run or

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.460 
there was no way it would ever run or
turn<00:02:36.580> over<00:02:36.880> or<00:02:37.000> anything<00:02:37.209> here's<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
turn over or anything here's all the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.100 
turn over or anything here's all the
wiring<00:02:39.430> harness<00:02:40.000> laying<00:02:40.300> here<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.269> goes<00:02:43.900> all

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
wiring harness laying here so goes all

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.759 
wiring harness laying here so goes all
the<00:02:44.230> lights<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.950> everything<00:02:45.790> up<00:02:46.030> front<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.769> I

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the lights and everything up front and I

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.070 
the lights and everything up front and I
thought<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.340> was<00:02:48.519> interesting<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.180> wire

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
thought this was interesting the wire

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.320 
thought this was interesting the wire
that<00:02:50.260> goes<00:02:50.320> up<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.769> steering<00:02:51.010> column<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
that goes up the steering column for the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.720 
that goes up the steering column for the
horn<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.950> know<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.100> just<00:02:54.370> wrapped<00:02:54.610> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
horn and you know I just wrapped it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
horn and you know I just wrapped it
around<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> couple<00:02:55.390> times<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.080> then

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
around there a couple times and then

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.930 
around there a couple times and then
goes<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.800> inside<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.400> steering

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
goes up on the inside of the steering

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.470 
goes up on the inside of the steering
column<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.470> bottom<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:01.330> know<00:03:01.420> I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
column on the bottom and you know I

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.210 
column on the bottom and you know I
assume<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.959> came<00:03:02.200> from<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> factory<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:02.980> way

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
assume it came from the factory that way

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.920 
assume it came from the factory that way
this<00:03:03.430> truck<00:03:03.700> rolled<00:03:03.970> out<00:03:04.209> probably<00:03:04.600> was<00:03:04.780> that

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
this truck rolled out probably was that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.170 
this truck rolled out probably was that
wire<00:03:05.220> wrapped<00:03:06.220> around<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.519> steering<00:03:06.880> post

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
wire wrapped around that steering post

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.740 
wire wrapped around that steering post
there<00:03:07.750> was<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.079> no<00:03:10.200> plastic<00:03:11.200> anything<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
there was just no plastic anything and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.150 
there was just no plastic anything and
even<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.989> brackets<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.500> hold<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:14.920> stuff

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
even the brackets that hold this stuff

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.220 
even the brackets that hold this stuff
up<00:03:15.400> most<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.820> them<00:03:15.940> are<00:03:16.000> metal<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.870> bolt<00:03:17.079> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
up most of them are metal that bolt to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.780 
up most of them are metal that bolt to
the<00:03:17.260> frame<00:03:17.590> somewhere<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.400> was<00:03:18.610> all

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
the frame somewhere and this was all

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.120 
the frame somewhere and this was all
probably<00:03:19.299> laid<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.690> here<00:03:19.900> nice<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.739> neat<00:03:20.890> and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
probably laid in here nice and neat and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.960 
probably laid in here nice and neat and
out<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> way<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.989> wanted<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.940> show<00:03:24.940> you

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
out of the way but I wanted to show you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.050 
out of the way but I wanted to show you
this<00:03:25.980> we've<00:03:26.980> got<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.459> little<00:03:27.489> bit<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
this we've got just a little bit of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.050 
this we've got just a little bit of
slack<00:03:28.329> here<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.650> thought<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.640> was<00:03:30.790> pretty

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
slack here and I thought this was pretty

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.330 
slack here and I thought this was pretty
neat<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:31.989> held<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.500> with<00:03:32.560> bailing<00:03:33.160> wire

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
neat this is held on with bailing wire

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.660 
neat this is held on with bailing wire
or<00:03:34.090> heavy-duty<00:03:34.540> wire<00:03:34.840> again<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:38.400> talk<00:03:39.400> about<00:03:39.640> a

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
or heavy-duty wire again so talk about a

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.030 
or heavy-duty wire again so talk about a
little<00:03:39.790> bit<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.090> bump<00:03:40.299> steering<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:41.680> has<00:03:41.860> got

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
little bit of bump steering this has got

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.259 
little bit of bump steering this has got
just<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.370> little<00:03:42.610> slack<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> front<00:03:43.450> end<00:03:44.190> and

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
just a little slack in the front end and

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.660 
just a little slack in the front end and
it's<00:03:46.269> all<00:03:46.510> fun<00:03:48.959> got<00:03:49.959> my<00:03:50.140> plug<00:03:50.410> wires<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:51.010> got<00:03:51.489> my

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
it's all fun got my plug wires on got my

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.319 
it's all fun got my plug wires on got my
gas<00:03:51.910> tank<00:03:52.470> cooked<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.799> fuel<00:03:54.400> pump<00:03:54.730> cleaned<00:03:55.120> up

gas tank cooked up fuel pump cleaned up

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.920 
gas tank cooked up fuel pump cleaned up
and<00:03:55.570> put<00:03:55.780> back<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.260> all<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.890> oh<00:03:57.850> okay<00:03:58.480> here<00:03:58.690> I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
want to show you this manifold it's just

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.539 
want to show you this manifold it's just
a<00:04:02.109> cool-looking<00:04:02.560> manifold

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
a cool-looking manifold

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.090 
a cool-looking manifold
there's<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.299> firing<00:04:04.660> order<00:04:04.810> on<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.590> manifold

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
there's the firing order on the manifold

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.670 
there's the firing order on the manifold
and<00:04:06.280> then<00:04:06.370> over<00:04:06.609> here<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:07.440> Chevrolet<00:04:08.440> bow-tie

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and then over here is Chevrolet bow-tie

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.800 
and then over here is Chevrolet bow-tie
which<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.760> really<00:04:10.540> cool<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:12.330> pretty<00:04:13.330> soon<00:04:13.540> one

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
which is really cool and pretty soon one

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.250 
which is really cool and pretty soon one
of<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.959> things<00:04:14.319> I'll<00:04:14.500> do<00:04:14.650> is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
of the things I'll do is

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.500 
of the things I'll do is
is<00:04:15.500> pull<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:16.010> generator<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.910> clean<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.359> up

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
is pull that generator and clean it up

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.259 
is pull that generator and clean it up
and<00:04:17.720> oil<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.350> up<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.739> change<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> brushes<00:04:20.090> and

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
and oil it up and change the brushes and

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.150 
and oil it up and change the brushes and
you<00:04:21.019> know<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.290> way<00:04:21.410> things<00:04:21.680> are<00:04:21.769> going<00:04:22.010> here

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
you know the way things are going here

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.500 
you know the way things are going here
I'll<00:04:22.250> be<00:04:22.400> surprised<00:04:22.790> if<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> don't<00:04:23.360> work

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
I'll be surprised if it don't work

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.080 
I'll be surprised if it don't work
everything<00:04:24.350> I'll<00:04:24.590> pull<00:04:24.800> off<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.220> clean<00:04:25.910> up

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
everything I'll pull off and clean up

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.530 
everything I'll pull off and clean up
and<00:04:26.949> lube<00:04:27.949> up<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.400> put<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.639> back<00:04:28.760> on<00:04:29.000> seems<00:04:29.389> to

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
and lube up and put it back on seems to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.659 
and lube up and put it back on seems to
work<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.080> we'll<00:04:30.949> see<00:04:31.070> how<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.190> goes<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.639> that

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
work so we'll see how it goes with that

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:41.530 
work so we'll see how it goes with that
but<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.419> lot<00:04:33.289> of<00:04:33.669> interesting<00:04:34.669> stuff

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.020 

well<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.170> doing<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.470> little<00:04:42.620> repair<00:04:42.860> on<00:04:43.490> this

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
well I'm doing a little repair on this

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.630 
well I'm doing a little repair on this
exhaust<00:04:44.660> manifold<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.190> just<00:04:46.400> want<00:04:46.580> to

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
exhaust manifold and I just want to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.990 
exhaust manifold and I just want to
point<00:04:46.820> out<00:04:47.000> here<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:49.070> able<00:04:49.160> to<00:04:49.340> heat<00:04:49.850> this

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
point out here I was able to heat this

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.250 
point out here I was able to heat this
up<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.360> get<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.840> bolt<00:04:51.620> out<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:52.900> think<00:04:53.900> they're

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
up and get this bolt out I think they're

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.110 
up and get this bolt out I think they're
not<00:04:54.410> twisted<00:04:54.740> off<00:04:55.040> but<00:04:55.250> when<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.520> was<00:04:55.670> taking<00:04:56.030> it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
not twisted off but when I was taking it

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.430 
not twisted off but when I was taking it
off<00:04:56.440> which<00:04:57.440> they<00:04:57.710> do<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.890> lot<00:04:58.070> of<00:04:58.190> times<00:04:58.430> but

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
off which they do a lot of times but

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.970 
off which they do a lot of times but
someone<00:05:00.440> has<00:05:00.590> tried<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.830> weld<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:02.980> I've

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
someone has tried to weld this and I've

I'll<00:05:18.710> just<00:05:18.890> put<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.280> bolt<00:05:19.520> run<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:19.760> bolt<00:05:19.970> down

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
I'll just put a bolt run a bolt down

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.510 
I'll just put a bolt run a bolt down
through<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.720> top<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.680> then<00:05:22.010> put<00:05:22.190> them<00:05:22.310> out<00:05:22.400> on

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
through the top and then put them out on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.000 
through the top and then put them out on
the<00:05:22.640> bottom<00:05:22.790> of<00:05:23.000> my<00:05:23.060> flange<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:24.470> it'll<00:05:24.800> do<00:05:24.890> the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
the bottom of my flange and it'll do the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:35.010 
the bottom of my flange and it'll do the
same<00:05:25.390> same<00:05:26.390> job

fix<00:06:25.720> but<00:06:26.110> I<00:06:26.380> put<00:06:27.069> a<00:06:27.099> little<00:06:27.220> bit<00:06:27.430> of<00:06:27.550> heat

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
fix but I put a little bit of heat

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.089 
fix but I put a little bit of heat
around<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.569> and<00:06:29.050> on<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.259> other<00:06:29.349> side<00:06:29.470> just<00:06:30.009> a

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
around this and on the other side just a

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.469 
around this and on the other side just a
little<00:06:30.130> bit<00:06:30.370> not<00:06:30.639> too<00:06:30.699> much<00:06:30.849> because<00:06:31.210> this<00:06:31.300> is

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
little bit not too much because this is

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.050 
little bit not too much because this is
cast-iron<00:06:31.990> but<00:06:32.319> and<00:06:32.889> then<00:06:33.430> started<00:06:33.789> tapping

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
cast-iron but and then started tapping

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.040 
cast-iron but and then started tapping
on<00:06:34.419> each<00:06:35.050> end<00:06:35.289> of<00:06:35.380> this<00:06:35.500> little<00:06:35.740> shaft<00:06:36.509> and<00:06:37.509> go

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
on each end of this little shaft and go

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.480 
on each end of this little shaft and go
along<00:06:38.289> or<00:06:38.620> you<00:06:39.610> know<00:06:39.759> it<00:06:39.909> look<00:06:40.090> here<00:06:41.370> it's<00:06:42.370> all
