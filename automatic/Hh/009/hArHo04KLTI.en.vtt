this full of pellets a bag of pellets
which<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.550> kilo<00:00:18.300> bag<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> pellets<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.640> just

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
which is a kilo bag of pellets and just

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
which is a kilo bag of pellets and just
soak<00:00:21.240> them<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> water<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
soak them in the water for about a

minute<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.480> tip<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.260> excess

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
minute and then just tip the excess

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
minute and then just tip the excess
water<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.670> I've<00:00:26.789> left<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> pellets<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
water off and I've left the pellets to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
water off and I've left the pellets to
stand<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.500> while<00:00:28.769> I've<00:00:28.980> been<00:00:29.010> rigging<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.699> on

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
stand then while I've been rigging up on

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.920 
stand then while I've been rigging up on
the<00:00:30.539> peg<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> fish<00:00:31.650> today

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
the peg that I'm going to fish today

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.200 
the peg that I'm going to fish today
now<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> pellets<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> soft<00:00:35.399> core<00:00:35.790> soft

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
now the pellets then the soft core soft

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.990 
now the pellets then the soft core soft
the<00:00:36.420> soften<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.100> easy<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the soften up so then it's easy then to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.450 
the soften up so then it's easy then to
stick<00:00:39.360> them<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> method<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:41.219> there's<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
stick them to a method but there's a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
stick them to a method but there's a
couple<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.450> pointers<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
couple of little pointers that I do I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.690 
couple of little pointers that I do I
always<00:00:44.160> mix<00:00:44.579> about<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> 250<00:00:46.440> ml<00:00:46.469> pot<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.250> fish

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
always mix about a 250 ml pot of fish

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810 
always mix about a 250 ml pot of fish
meal<00:00:47.940> groundbait<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> palace<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.520> just

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
meal groundbait to the palace this just

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
meal groundbait to the palace this just
helps<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.390> split<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> pellets<00:00:52.739> off<00:00:53.840> once

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
helps to split all the pellets off once

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.430 
helps to split all the pellets off once
the<00:00:55.020> pellets<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.559> split<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.930> they're<00:00:57.930> easier

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the pellets are split up they're easier

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
the pellets are split up they're easier
to<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> feed<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.910> don't<00:01:00.120> stick

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to get on the feed and they don't stick

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.549 
to get on the feed and they don't stick
to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> mold<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:02.000> also<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to the mold as much also then I want the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
to the mold as much also then I want the
pellets<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.220> quite<00:01:05.489> sticky<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.270> just

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
pellets to be quite sticky so I'm just

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
pellets to be quite sticky so I'm just
going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> add<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.409> small<00:01:07.799> amount<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.549> Horlicks

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
going to add a small amount of Horlicks

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
going to add a small amount of Horlicks
this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.840> normal<00:01:10.439> ordinary<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.549> its

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this is just normal ordinary all its

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.870 
this is just normal ordinary all its
powder<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> small<00:01:14.250> amount<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
powder and I just put a small amount of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.359 
powder and I just put a small amount of
that<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.900> help<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.560> stickiness<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that on just to help the stickiness of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
that on just to help the stickiness of
the<00:01:17.430> pellets<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:19.110> stay<00:01:19.409> with

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the pellets so they actually stay with

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.999 
the pellets so they actually stay with
the<00:01:19.799> feeder<00:01:20.210> when<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> cast<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> into<00:01:22.009> waters

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the feeder when you cast it into waters

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.600 
the feeder when you cast it into waters
where<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.939> four<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.240> five<00:01:24.600> foot<00:01:24.930> deep<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
where it's four or five foot deep it's

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.740 
where it's four or five foot deep it's
important<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> pellets<00:01:27.479> quite

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
important to have the pellets quite

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
important to have the pellets quite
sticky<00:01:28.259> else<00:01:28.409> they'll<00:01:28.650> leave<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> feeder<00:01:29.400> if

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
sticky else they'll leave the feeder if

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
sticky else they'll leave the feeder if
you<00:01:30.240> chuck<00:01:30.450> into<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> bank<00:01:31.170> where<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.680> only

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you chuck into a bank where it's only

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
you chuck into a bank where it's only
maybe<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> foot<00:01:32.610> deep<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> tool<00:01:33.420> foot<00:01:33.689> deep

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
maybe a foot deep or a tool foot deep

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560 
maybe a foot deep or a tool foot deep
it's<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.619> important<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.390> them

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it's not so important but I want them

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's not so important but I want them
pellets<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.110> steer<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.890> feeder<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.700> then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pellets to steer with the feeder if then

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
pellets to steer with the feeder if then
pellets<00:01:39.299> come<00:01:39.479> off<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> feeder<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.320> very

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
pellets come off the feeder it's very

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
pellets come off the feeder it's very
very<00:01:40.829> difficult<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.579> catch<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.970> fish<00:01:42.180> because

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
very difficult to catch a fish because

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
very difficult to catch a fish because
you've<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.079> set<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> trap<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.640> trap<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> not

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you've not set the trap the trap is not

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.190 
you've not set the trap the trap is not
set<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> fish<00:01:46.700> just<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.060> quick<00:01:48.720> look<00:01:48.990> at

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
set for the fish just a a quick look at

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280 
set for the fish just a a quick look at
how<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.369> rigged<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.450> journal<00:01:51.899> method

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
how have rigged up my journal method

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.149 
how have rigged up my journal method
feeder<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:53.970> done<00:01:54.119> I've<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
feeder what I've done I've just put a

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.209 
feeder what I've done I've just put a
stop<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.490> rubber<00:01:57.240> stop<00:01:57.630> above<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> line<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
stop a rubber stop above the line to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.030

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
abrupt slope then I change this feed

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.800 
abrupt slope then I change this feed
that<00:02:33.420> yields<00:02:33.810> probably<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.940> 35<00:02:35.940> gram<00:02:36.360> method

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that yields probably a 35 gram method

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
that yields probably a 35 gram method
feeder<00:02:37.080> because<00:02:37.319> when<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.980> slope

you<00:02:38.760> don't<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.269> feeder<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.900> move<00:02:40.940> so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
you don't want that feeder to move so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.650 
you don't want that feeder to move so
it's<00:02:42.060> quite<00:02:42.239> simply<00:02:42.750> use<00:02:43.040> very<00:02:44.040> simply<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.060> 15

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
feeder I'm going to use I just use a a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.750 
feeder I'm going to use I just use a a
Drennan<00:03:11.610> swivel<00:03:12.420> clip<00:03:12.950> adapter<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.130> that

Drennan swivel clip adapter and that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 
Drennan swivel clip adapter and that
actually<00:03:15.090> fits<00:03:15.390> inside<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.170> feeder<00:03:16.410> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
actually fits inside the feeder that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.069 
actually fits inside the feeder that
locks<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> fish<00:03:18.269> picks<00:03:18.660> up<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
locks up so when the fish picks up the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.259 
locks up so when the fish picks up the
bait<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.739> picks<00:03:20.160> up<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.400> feeder<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> hooks

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
bait it picks up the feeder and hooks

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.900 
bait it picks up the feeder and hooks
itself<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.140> well<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
itself as well so that's just what I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.170 
itself as well so that's just what I
like<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.510> use<00:03:24.720> I'd<00:03:24.930> rather<00:03:25.140> use<00:03:25.530> the

like to use I'd rather use the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.449 
like to use I'd rather use the

the<00:04:02.970> pellet<00:04:03.329> in<00:04:03.540> there<00:04:03.840> into<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.650> mold<00:04:05.389> don't

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
the pellet in there into the mold don't

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.520 
the pellet in there into the mold don't
overfill<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.620> method<00:04:08.209> mold<00:04:09.209> because<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:10.319> you

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
overfill the method mold because if you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.180 
overfill the method mold because if you
overfill<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.819> keep<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.359> sort<00:04:12.720> of

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
overfill it I like to keep it sort of

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.430 
overfill it I like to keep it sort of
five<00:04:14.190> mil<00:04:14.639> down<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> top<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.169> you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
five mil down from the top if you

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.469 
five mil down from the top if you
overfill<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.250> tends<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.639> stick<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.090> little

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
overfill it it tends to stick a little

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.140 
overfill it it tends to stick a little
in<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.690> mold<00:04:19.130> right<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.489> then<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.789> just<00:04:20.970> a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
in the mold right so then it's just a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.600 
in the mold right so then it's just a
case<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.419> turned<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.109> method<00:04:22.500> mold<00:04:23.130> round<00:04:23.430> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
case of turned the method mold round the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.909 
case of turned the method mold round the
line<00:04:23.909> has<00:04:24.150> been<00:04:24.360> put<00:04:24.599> into<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.080> front<00:04:25.440> groove

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
line has been put into the front groove

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.770 
line has been put into the front groove
of<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:27.120> MA

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
of the MA

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.350 
of the MA
turn<00:04:28.499> your<00:04:28.680> method<00:04:29.009> round<00:04:29.280> drop<00:04:29.759> it<00:04:29.939> onto<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
turn your method round drop it onto the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.600 
turn your method round drop it onto the
top<00:04:30.569> of<00:04:30.599> the<00:04:30.870> pellets<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.530> then<00:04:32.039> squeeze<00:04:32.580> it

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
top of the pellets and then squeeze it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.679 
top of the pellets and then squeeze it
in<00:04:33.120> place<00:04:33.499> now<00:04:34.499> really<00:04:35.159> squeeze<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.580> hard<00:04:36.029> so

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
in place now really squeeze it hard so

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.429 
in place now really squeeze it hard so
that<00:04:36.719> the<00:04:37.080> pellets<00:04:37.560> are<00:04:37.800> hard<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:38.999> feeder

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 
that the pellets are hard on the feeder

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.760 
that the pellets are hard on the feeder
now<00:04:40.439> just<00:04:41.279> inside<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.150> bit<00:04:42.389> there<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:43.139> your

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
now just inside the bit there is your

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.550 
now just inside the bit there is your
actual<00:04:44.189> hook<00:04:44.400> bit<00:04:44.759> this<00:04:45.479> works<00:04:45.870> very<00:04:46.110> well

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
actual hook bit this works very well

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.649 
actual hook bit this works very well
when<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.699> fit<00:04:47.939> when<00:04:48.090> you're<00:04:48.240> fishing<00:04:48.389> in

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
when the fit when you're fishing in

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.170 
when the fit when you're fishing in
shallow<00:04:48.719> water<00:04:49.409> up<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.889> an<00:04:50.009> island<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.939> works

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
shallow water up to an island it works

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.550 
shallow water up to an island it works
very<00:04:51.419> well<00:04:51.539> because<00:04:51.870> when<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.319> feeder

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
very well because when the feeder

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.219 
very well because when the feeder
arrives<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:53.249> the<00:04:53.279> bottom<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:54.330> fish<00:04:54.569> attack<00:04:54.990> it

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
arrives on the bottom the fish attack it

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.739 
arrives on the bottom the fish attack it
and<00:04:55.379> the<00:04:55.650> bit<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.249> immediately<00:04:57.090> showing<00:04:57.449> to

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
and the bit is immediately showing to

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.439 
and the bit is immediately showing to
the<00:04:57.900> fish<00:04:58.219> if<00:04:59.219> I'm<00:04:59.430> going<00:04:59.729> down<00:04:59.909> into<00:05:00.120> deep

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
the fish if I'm going down into deep

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.529 
the fish if I'm going down into deep
water<00:05:00.810> into<00:05:01.229> maybe<00:05:01.439> four<00:05:01.740> or<00:05:01.770> five<00:05:01.979> four<00:05:02.550> then

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
water into maybe four or five four then

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.719 
water into maybe four or five four then
it's<00:05:03.750> possible<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.439> that<00:05:04.740> pellet<00:05:05.279> might

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
it's possible that that pellet might

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.959 
it's possible that that pellet might
leave<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.509> feeder<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.139> then<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:08.099> method<00:05:08.789> or

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
leave the feeder and then the method or

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.629 
leave the feeder and then the method or
the<00:05:09.029> trap<00:05:09.539> is<00:05:09.750> not<00:05:09.990> set<00:05:10.289> so<00:05:10.919> if<00:05:11.039> I'm<00:05:11.189> fishing<00:05:11.370> in

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
the trap is not set so if I'm fishing in

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.269 
the trap is not set so if I'm fishing in
deeper<00:05:12.120> water<00:05:12.360> or<00:05:12.750> I'm<00:05:13.229> wanting<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.710> add<00:05:13.979> more

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:14.279 
deeper water or I'm wanting to add more

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.209 
deeper water or I'm wanting to add more
bait<00:05:14.610> into<00:05:14.879> a<00:05:15.060> peg<00:05:15.389> it's<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.169> simple<00:05:16.620> task<00:05:16.860> then

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
bait into a peg it's a simple task then

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.209 
bait into a peg it's a simple task then
of<00:05:17.430> refill<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.330> method<00:05:18.629> feed<00:05:18.810> again<00:05:19.289> keeping

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
of refill the method feed again keeping

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.029 
of refill the method feed again keeping
it<00:05:20.370> down<00:05:20.669> quite<00:05:21.629> a<00:05:21.689> bit<00:05:21.900> from<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.529> top<00:05:22.560> not

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
it down quite a bit from the top not

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.079 
it down quite a bit from the top not
overfill<00:05:23.639> in<00:05:23.789> it<00:05:23.990> right<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.229> then<00:05:25.620> place<00:05:26.339> the

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
overfill in it right and then place the

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.320 
overfill in it right and then place the
feeder<00:05:27.419> back<00:05:28.259> inside<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.099> then<00:05:29.819> crush<00:05:30.150> it

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
feeder back inside and then crush it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.619 
feeder back inside and then crush it
again<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.830> once<00:05:32.039> that's<00:05:32.370> removed<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:33.599> can

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
again and once that's removed you can

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.230 
again and once that's removed you can
see<00:05:34.020> now<00:05:34.229> I've<00:05:34.439> got<00:05:34.620> extra<00:05:35.129> pellets<00:05:35.759> on<00:05:36.029> that

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
see now I've got extra pellets on that

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.329 
see now I've got extra pellets on that
feeder<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:37.289> when<00:05:37.439> you're<00:05:37.560> going<00:05:37.770> down<00:05:38.039> into

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:38.339 
feeder and when you're going down into

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.490 
feeder and when you're going down into
extra<00:05:38.789> depth<00:05:39.089> and<00:05:39.539> where<00:05:39.870> you're<00:05:40.020> wanting<00:05:40.469> to

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
extra depth and where you're wanting to

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.550 
extra depth and where you're wanting to
feed<00:05:40.889> more<00:05:41.159> bit<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.509> actually<00:05:42.659> cram<00:05:43.229> more

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
feed more bit you can actually cram more

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.550 
feed more bit you can actually cram more
bit<00:05:43.860> onto<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.399> feeder<00:05:44.669> very<00:05:45.089> easily<00:05:45.560> so

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
bit onto the feeder very easily so

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.379 
bit onto the feeder very easily so
that's<00:05:46.710> just<00:05:46.889> two<00:05:47.250> ways<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.819> can<00:05:48.000> see<00:05:48.180> that

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
that's just two ways you can see that

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.050 
that's just two ways you can see that
the<00:05:48.569> line<00:05:48.839> because<00:05:49.529> of<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.949> put<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.729> hook

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the line because of I put the hook

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.749 
the line because of I put the hook
length<00:05:51.449> line<00:05:51.839> in<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.680> front<00:05:53.009> part<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.580> the

length line in the front part of the

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.149 
length line in the front part of the
mold<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.389> see<00:05:54.659> that<00:05:54.960> everything's<00:05:55.800> nice

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159

and neat and the line is entering the

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.379 
and neat and the line is entering the
feeder<00:05:59.490> easily<00:06:00.860> so<00:06:01.860> that's<00:06:02.129> how<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.520> fish<00:06:03.120> and
