I<00:01:32.939> prefer<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.060> go<00:01:34.210> sever<00:01:34.720> 6<00:01:35.079> gives<00:01:35.799> my<00:01:35.979> copter<00:01:36.220> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.099 

if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.859> have<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> set<00:01:41.840> straight

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.840 

next<00:01:46.109> we're<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.649> adjust<00:01:47.159> our<00:01:47.340> stoppers

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
next we're going to adjust our stoppers

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.870 
next we're going to adjust our stoppers
for<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.420> type<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.750> flight<00:01:49.049> google-like<00:01:49.880> if

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
for the type of flight google-like if

for the type of flight google-like if
you<00:01:51.090> desire<00:01:51.420> higher<00:01:51.780> flight

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you desire higher flight

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.719 
you desire higher flight
I<00:01:53.240> recommend<00:01:54.240> bending<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.630> wings<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.729> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
I recommend bending the wings down this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
I recommend bending the wings down this
will<00:01:56.909> give<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.179> more<00:01:57.649> lift<00:01:59.539> if<00:02:00.539> you<00:02:00.659> would

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
will give you more lift if you would

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.339 
will give you more lift if you would
rather<00:02:01.349> like<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.829> smoother<00:02:02.369> flight<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:04.170> want

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
rather like a smoother flight you want

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.480 
rather like a smoother flight you want
to<00:02:04.439> keep<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.709> wings<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.099> straight<00:02:05.399> as

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to keep your wings as straight as

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.509 
to keep your wings as straight as
possible<00:02:06.799> this<00:02:07.799> will<00:02:08.009> give<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> much

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
possible this will give you a much

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.630 
possible this will give you a much
smoother<00:02:08.940> flight<00:02:09.799> it<00:02:10.799> is<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.129> necessary<00:02:11.610> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
smoother flight it is not necessary to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.759 
smoother flight it is not necessary to
use<00:02:11.879> all<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.299> force<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.379> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> use
