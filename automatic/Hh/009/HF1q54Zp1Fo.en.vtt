00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.840
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:14.160
 I'm making another video 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:19.619
 I was taking a look is by 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 internet and I realized that there are many 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.449
 people complaining that the 2013 weight 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.670
 this is giving an error 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:42.090
 these mistakes happen when you are 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 choosing is a club and clicking to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.399
 start the game it the country it closes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 automatically 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.559
 I also saw some videos that have some 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.379
 teaching the kit download tutorials 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 version 3 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.589
 I downloaded because I like it or 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 I wanted to make sure that if I really 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:14.850
 It worked fine in my do not work 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.240
 it worked began or is the continuum 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.909
 error, right? 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.720
 So what was it that I discovered 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 one simple thing you do not need is 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.180
 download nothing just is we go 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 open the page where the game is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.560

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.390
 What a little so we can see better. 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:03.960

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.670
 soon I did not come here on local disk is that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.670
 programs here 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 I had the program file and the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.830
 Conan Bonfim 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.850

 There are no excuses, I discovered this, we go. 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.140

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:43.160
 So how do we do this? 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.400
