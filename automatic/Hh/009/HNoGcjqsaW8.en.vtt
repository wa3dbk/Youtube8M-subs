00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the projects and take that sample

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.550 
the projects and take that sample
project<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.390> archived<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.170> movie

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
project and put that in archived I movie
projects<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.090> I've<00:02:06.299> been<00:02:06.540> moving<00:02:06.630> these

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
projects now if I've been moving these

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
projects now if I've been moving these
to<00:02:06.960> another<00:02:07.170> drive<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.920> would<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.250> copied

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
to another drive it would have copied

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.969 
to another drive it would have copied
them<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.470> them<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
them so I would still have them here so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
them so I would still have them here so
then<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> select<00:02:11.849> them

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
then I have to select them

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.080 
then I have to select them
and<00:02:12.840> delete<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.740> project<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.340> delete<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and delete the project and delete the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.970 
and delete the project and delete the
event<00:02:15.330> once<00:02:15.510> i'm<00:02:15.660> sure<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.080> has<00:02:16.200> copied<00:02:16.620> over

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
event once i'm sure that has copied over

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.640 
event once i'm sure that has copied over
to<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.400> other<00:02:17.580> drive<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:19.050> i'm<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> run

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to the other drive now i'm going to run

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.130 
to the other drive now i'm going to run
I<00:02:19.890> movie<00:02:20.250> again<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.730> simply<00:02:21.390> by<00:02:21.510> removing

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
I movie again and simply by removing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900 
I movie again and simply by removing
those<00:02:22.470> projects<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.100> events<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
those projects and events from there I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.660 
those projects and events from there I
movie<00:02:24.630> picks<00:02:25.350> up<00:02:25.500> right<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:26.130> from<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.490> it's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
movie picks up right right from it it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.030 
movie picks up right right from it it's
no<00:02:27.090> longer<00:02:27.120> listing<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.140> project<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.770> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
no longer listing of that project and it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.699 
no longer listing of that project and it
no<00:02:29.220> longer<00:02:29.250> shows<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:30.150> event<00:02:30.480> there<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.380> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
no longer shows that event there so I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.560 
no longer shows that event there so I
movie<00:02:32.010> doesn't<00:02:32.190> ask<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.520> anything<00:02:33.060> special

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
movie doesn't ask for anything special

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.170 
movie doesn't ask for anything special
just<00:02:33.810> remove<00:02:34.650> those<00:02:34.800> folders<00:02:35.220> move<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.910> file

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
just remove those folders move that file

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.510 
just remove those folders move that file
and<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:36.959> no<00:02:37.200> longer<00:02:37.230> appear<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:38.040> iMovie

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
and it will no longer appear in iMovie

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.090 
and it will no longer appear in iMovie
so<00:02:39.300> now<00:02:39.420> let's<00:02:39.660> quit<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.140> movie<00:02:40.440> again<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
so now let's quit I movie again and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.670 
so now let's quit I movie again and
let's<00:02:41.910> go<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.330> reverse<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.840> process<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.470> say

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
let's go and reverse the process to say

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
let's go and reverse the process to say
it's<00:02:44.220> six<00:02:44.490> months<00:02:44.700> later<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> go

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's six months later and I want to go

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.990 
it's six months later and I want to go
back<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.350> project<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.459> I'll<00:02:47.580> take

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
back to this project here so I'll take

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030 
back to this project here so I'll take
this<00:02:48.330> sample<00:02:48.750> project<00:02:49.320> from<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.470> archived

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
this sample project from the archived

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.010 
this sample project from the archived
folder<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.150> I'll<00:02:51.330> move<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> back<00:02:51.840> into

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
folder there and I'll move it back into

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.260 
folder there and I'll move it back into
my<00:02:52.140> imovie<00:02:52.470> projects<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> will<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.700> into<00:02:53.820> iMovie

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
my imovie projects I will go into iMovie

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.710 
my imovie projects I will go into iMovie
events<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.080> i<00:02:55.230> will<00:02:55.380> move<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:56.720> events

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
events and i will move that events

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
events and i will move that events
folder<00:02:58.050> right<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.160> into<00:02:59.489> iMovie<00:02:59.850> events

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
folder right there into iMovie events

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.420 
folder right there into iMovie events
just<00:03:00.720> basically<00:03:00.989> replacing<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.830> back<00:03:02.190> where

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
just basically replacing it back where

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.420 
just basically replacing it back where
it<00:03:02.459> was<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.540> now<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.170> were<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.709> run<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.100> movie

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
it was so now if I were to run I movie

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.870 
it was so now if I were to run I movie
again<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.660> see<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.530> both<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.400> project

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
again I would see that both the project

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.630 
again I would see that both the project
and<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.239> event<00:03:09.540> has<00:03:09.840> been<00:03:10.200> replaced<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> put

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
and the event has been replaced and put

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.310 
and the event has been replaced and put
back<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.030> place<00:03:12.060> there<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.020> sample

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
back in place there it's a sample

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.710 
back in place there it's a sample
project<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.489> see<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.760> event<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.570> as

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
project I can see the event is there as

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.810 
project I can see the event is there as
well<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.320> if<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.980> actually<00:03:17.100> go<00:03:17.340> into<00:03:17.489> sample

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
well and if I actually go into sample

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.250 
well and if I actually go into sample
project<00:03:18.150> see<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.390> picks<00:03:18.600> up<00:03:18.720> right<00:03:19.019> where<00:03:19.080> I

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
project see it picks up right where I

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.199 
project see it picks up right where I
left<00:03:19.290> off<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:21.000> don't<00:03:21.120> have

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
left off it's like it's you don't have

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.699 
left off it's like it's you don't have
to<00:03:21.299> relink<00:03:21.660> anything<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.260> tell<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.590> where

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
to relink anything or tell it where

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.949 
to relink anything or tell it where
things<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.400> doesn't<00:03:24.330> mind<00:03:24.450> at<00:03:24.600> all<00:03:24.720> that

cash<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.630> imovie<00:03:33.959> thumbnails<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.590> found<00:03:35.010> that

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
cash and imovie thumbnails I found that

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.610 
cash and imovie thumbnails I found that
you<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.670> just<00:03:35.880> delete<00:03:36.030> these<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.410> what

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
you can just delete these so what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.620 
you can just delete these so what
happens<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.070> delete<00:03:38.430> them<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.820> iMovie<00:03:39.420> has

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
happens if you delete them is iMovie has

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.030 
happens if you delete them is iMovie has
to<00:03:39.780> recreate<00:03:40.260> them<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.620> there's<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:40.920> bit

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
to recreate them so there's a little bit

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.800 
to recreate them so there's a little bit
of<00:03:41.160> delay<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.640> next<00:03:41.880> time<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.060> use<00:03:42.180> those

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
of delay the next time you use those

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.470 
of delay the next time you use those
videos<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.130> does<00:03:44.310> actually<00:03:44.519> work<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
videos but it does actually work the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.970 
videos but it does actually work the
cash<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> course<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.320> recreated<00:03:46.769> it's

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
cash of course you just recreated it's

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.400 
cash of course you just recreated it's
just<00:03:47.510> basically<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> little<00:03:48.900> videos<00:03:49.170> they're

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
just basically the little videos they're

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.990 
just basically the little videos they're
just<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.250> display<00:03:50.640> them<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.910> little

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
just so we can display them a little

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060 
just so we can display them a little
quicker<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.260> while<00:03:52.470> you're<00:03:52.590> editing<00:03:52.709> and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
quicker for you while you're editing and

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
quicker for you while you're editing and
the<00:03:53.370> thumbnails<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.299> same<00:03:54.480> thing<00:03:54.510> just

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
the thumbnails are the same thing just

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.990 
the thumbnails are the same thing just
something<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.290> help<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> quickly<00:03:56.340> display

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
something to help it quickly display

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.150 
something to help it quickly display
what's<00:03:57.630> available<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:58.110> those<00:03:58.440> two<00:03:58.799> folders

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
what's available if those two folders

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.550 
what's available if those two folders
are<00:03:59.340> missing<00:03:59.940> it'll<00:04:00.570> simply<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:00.989> recreate

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
are missing it'll simply just recreate

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
are missing it'll simply just recreate
them<00:04:01.739> when<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.070> uses<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.370> event<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.850> next

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
them when it uses the event the next

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.160 
them when it uses the event the next
time<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.600> save<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> little<00:04:03.959> bit<00:04:04.079> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
time so you can save a little bit of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.990 
time so you can save a little bit of
space<00:04:04.440> by<00:04:04.680> getting<00:04:05.040> rid<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.250> those<00:04:05.430> after<00:04:05.910> you

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
space by getting rid of those after you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.479 
space by getting rid of those after you
move<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.269> up<00:04:06.420> files<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:07.560> seems<00:04:07.920> pretty<00:04:08.160> using

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
move with up files it seems pretty using

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.270 
move with up files it seems pretty using
n<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.600> works<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.049> way<00:04:10.260> by<00:04:11.010> not

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
n it is it just works this way by not

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280 
n it is it just works this way by not
complicating<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> whole<00:04:12.390> file<00:04:12.630> structure<00:04:13.079> of

complicating the whole file structure of
