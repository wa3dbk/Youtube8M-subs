00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.360

 You can either press control-r on 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 keyboard or through the viewing line 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 before we click on them right 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.989
 key and remove the interest here so 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.890
 Now go to the selection and remove 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.610
 highlighting the shape of the vertical line and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 about 10 pixels measure out and 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.270
 here are the lines here or 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.820
 vertical it is you and I need for 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:57.899
 so that we have turned out later 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:01:00.690
 grid on the image so now 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.619
 choose a horizontal tool 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:14.369
 line and just as well do the lines along 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:15.540
 horizontals now try to do them 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.090
 smooth to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 squares you were as even as possible yes 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:33.210

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 grid on the image now click 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 create a new layer set the fill color 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.530

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.899
 Image webs change mode 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.040
 overlay then y layer overlap and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.310
 the grid acquires such 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.750
 interesting shade so super now 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.869
 go to the bottommost layer and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.209
 duplicate it click control jay 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.500
 so on go to layer grid and with 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.780
 using a tool 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.440
 magic wand select several 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 squared when in different parts of our 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:31.860
 images so here we go now to 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.799

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.989
 tinting and starting to choose a color 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.239
 who want to paint over the square here 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.540
 you can play around with the settings 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.930
 saturation 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.659
 color tone and brightness up as 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.430
 the result will suit you you close it 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:02.640

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.519
 now go back to the top layer and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.730
 we repeat the previous actions only already 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.950
 choose other squares before you need 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:26.459
 take here here so day and diligence 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 for example, so again we go to the image 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.450
 correction hue saturation 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 toning 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:47.209
 let's for example make a salad from 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:51.930
 hue so press ok 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.440
 select remove select new 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.440
 squares 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.520
 go to the bottom layer of the image 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.520
 correction so 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.079
 You can leave this color, click OK 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:34.910
 continue to choose squares so 90 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.450
 they are still not painted over 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:56.180
 image correction 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:58.430
 tone-saturation 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.630
 literally a few squares on the face 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.700
 they can be left untouched yes in 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.220
 principle, the effect is already possible to finish 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.260
 but if you want you can go ahead and 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.260
 add another very interesting one 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.700
 effect let's do this turn on 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.750
 top layer click on it right 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.340
 key and go to the parameters of the overlay 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:26.780
 here you can add our mesh shadow 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.290
 set the offset to 0 and click ok 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.960
 see that the grid we have become much 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.610
 looks more interesting than it was 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.940
 final touches can be removed 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.090
 several squares along the edges to 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:44.110
 the image looked somehow livelier but 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.110
 this is your choice
