00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
looks really good it's not like most of

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.270 
looks really good it's not like most of
the<00:01:28.240> diamond<00:01:28.810> shop<00:01:29.020> tins<00:01:29.289> where<00:01:30.100> they're

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
the diamond shop tins where they're

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.319 
the diamond shop tins where they're
really<00:01:30.939> really<00:01:31.539> way<00:01:32.049> too<00:01:32.079> big<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:33.329> awkward

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
really really way too big and awkward

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.959 
really really way too big and awkward
shapes<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.259> actually<00:01:35.859> looks<00:01:36.039> like<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.759> nice

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
shapes this actually looks like a nice

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.690 
shapes this actually looks like a nice
shape<00:01:37.329> with<00:01:38.020> last<00:01:38.409> colors<00:01:38.799> too<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:39.369> maybe

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
shape with last colors too and maybe

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.569 
shape with last colors too and maybe
there's<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.090> beach<00:01:40.359> thing<00:01:40.659> here<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:42.159> something

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
there's a beach thing here or something

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.800 
there's a beach thing here or something
but<00:01:42.759> as<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.090> can<00:01:43.210> see<00:01:43.390> there's<00:01:43.539> already<00:01:43.630> a

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
but as you can see there's already a

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.899 
but as you can see there's already a
pool<00:01:44.049> there<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:45.429> looks<00:01:45.609> quite<00:01:45.880> good

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
pool there and it looks quite good

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.609 
pool there and it looks quite good
actually<00:01:46.329> and<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.320> that<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
actually and you can see that this

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.240 
actually and you can see that this
section<00:01:48.100> here<00:01:48.369> matches<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.570> section<00:01:50.049> here<00:01:50.320> so

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
section here matches the section here so

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.550 
section here matches the section here so
it's<00:01:51.640> quite<00:01:51.820> possible<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:53.049> actually<00:01:53.289> is

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
it's quite possible that it actually is

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's quite possible that it actually is
going<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.039> be<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.189> new<00:01:54.310> den<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.479> reason<00:01:55.899> it

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
going to be a new den the reason it

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.739 
going to be a new den the reason it
isn't<00:01:56.799> it's<00:01:57.130> going<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.579> be<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.729> lance<00:01:58.030> the

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
isn't it's going to be a lance the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.810 
isn't it's going to be a lance the
reason<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.079> this<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.409> probably<00:01:59.619> true<00:01:59.820> is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
reason that this is probably true is

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.750 
reason that this is probably true is
because<00:02:01.090> when

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
because when

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.470 
because when
pet<00:02:01.940> geckos<00:02:02.360> came<00:02:02.690> out<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:04.400> said<00:02:04.790> coming<00:02:05.090> soon

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
pet geckos came out it said coming soon

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.270 
pet geckos came out it said coming soon
and<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.320> had<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.470> picture<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.700> tail<00:02:08.270> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and it had a picture of a tail and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.160 
and it had a picture of a tail and
footprints<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.910> everyone<00:02:11.600> thought<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.870> it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
footprints so everyone thought that it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.070 
footprints so everyone thought that it
was<00:02:12.290> going<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.710> be<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:13.040> new<00:02:13.310> animal<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:14.090> I

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
was going to be a new animal and I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140 
was going to be a new animal and I
thought<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.290> too<00:02:15.470> actually<00:02:15.830> I'm<00:02:16.400> gonna<00:02:16.910> turned

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
thought so too actually I'm gonna turned

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.530 
thought so too actually I'm gonna turned
up<00:02:17.270> being<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.570> pet<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.460> misleading<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
up being a pet so this is misleading and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.720 
up being a pet so this is misleading and
it<00:02:20.690> makes<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.050> seem<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.610> be

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it makes it seem like it's going to be

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.260 
it makes it seem like it's going to be
an<00:02:23.240> elance<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.250> actually<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.240> be

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
an elance but it is actually going to be

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.900 
an elance but it is actually going to be
again<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.130> what<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.730> look<00:02:28.880> like

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
again this is what is going to look like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.690 
again this is what is going to look like
in<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.050> diamond<00:02:30.410> shop<00:02:30.620> or<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.370> normal

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
in the diamond shop or in the normal

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.600 
in the diamond shop or in the normal
shop<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:33.110> looks<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.680> taken<00:02:34.130> from<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
shop this looks like it's taken from the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.790 
shop this looks like it's taken from the
Jamar<00:02:34.910> journal<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:36.110> ties<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
Jamar journal and it ties up with this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.830 
Jamar journal and it ties up with this
too<00:02:37.100> because<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.520> got<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> slide<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.480> it's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
too because it's got the slide and it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.620 
too because it's got the slide and it's
got<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.140> same<00:02:39.320> similar<00:02:40.250> shape<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.480> got

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
got the same similar shape and it's got

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.540 
got the same similar shape and it's got
the<00:02:41.810> thing<00:02:42.170> there<00:02:42.410> yeah<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.520> looks

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
the thing there yeah and it looks

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.580 
the thing there yeah and it looks
actually<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.720> would<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
actually like it would be this in the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.430 
actually like it would be this in the
exact<00:02:45.980> same<00:02:46.160> animal<00:02:46.670> jam<00:02:46.850> art<00:02:47.090> style<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:48.230> I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
exact same animal jam art style like I

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.720 
exact same animal jam art style like I
will<00:02:48.650> show<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:48.950> now<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:50.120> forget<00:02:50.600> here<00:02:51.730> it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
will show you now and forget here it's

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.240 
will show you now and forget here it's
in<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.000> same<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:53.990> a<00:02:54.020> very<00:02:54.200> similar<00:02:54.530> earth

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
in the same it's in a very similar earth

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.520 
in the same it's in a very similar earth
style<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> judge<00:02:56.510> could<00:02:56.750> make<00:02:57.020> some<00:02:57.440> of

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
style that a judge could make some of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.640 
style that a judge could make some of
the<00:02:57.590> shading<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:59.240> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.230> going

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the shading so I think that it's going

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.480 
the shading so I think that it's going
to<00:03:00.890> actually<00:03:01.850> be<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.240> den<00:03:02.709> I'm<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:04.160> looking

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
to actually be a den I'm really looking

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.790 
to actually be a den I'm really looking
forward<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.030> stand<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:05.770> actually<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
forward to the stand it's actually a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.970 
forward to the stand it's actually a
nice<00:03:07.130> shape<00:03:07.730> for<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> change<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.500> got<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
nice shape for a change and it's got the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.010 
nice shape for a change and it's got the
same<00:03:10.190> thing<00:03:10.700> on<00:03:10.880> both<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.239> sides<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:11.810> is

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
same thing on both the sides this is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.800 
same thing on both the sides this is
great<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.980> mirror<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:14.630> my

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
great because I mirror all my

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.229 
great because I mirror all my
decorations<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.680> both<00:03:15.890> sides<00:03:16.459> exactly<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
decorations on both sides exactly the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.020 
decorations on both sides exactly the
same<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> actually<00:03:18.980> can't<00:03:19.519> wait<00:03:19.730> for<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
same so I actually can't wait for the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.180 
same so I actually can't wait for the
stand<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:21.350> think<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.800> these<00:03:21.950> pictures

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
stand and I think that these pictures

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.910 
stand and I think that these pictures
are<00:03:22.750> actually<00:03:23.750> going<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.170> be<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.739> real<00:03:24.890> thing

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
are actually going to be the real thing

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.890 
are actually going to be the real thing
I<00:03:25.489> think<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.209> come<00:03:26.480> out<00:03:26.510> soon

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
I think this is going to come out soon

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.350 
I think this is going to come out soon
it<00:03:27.590> could<00:03:27.800> possibly<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.150> week

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
it could possibly this be this week

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.710 
it could possibly this be this week
those<00:03:29.630> there<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.610> another<00:03:31.610> reason<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.150> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
those there and another reason that it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.870 
those there and another reason that it
probably<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.350> actually<00:03:34.280> coming<00:03:34.459> up<00:03:34.640> in

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
probably is actually coming up in

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
probably is actually coming up in
America<00:03:35.390> it's<00:03:35.720> going<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.590> summer<00:03:36.860> very

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
America it's going to be summer very

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.050 
America it's going to be summer very
soon<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.570> looks<00:03:39.050> perfect<00:03:39.560> for<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.790> summer

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060

the<00:03:53.299> question<00:03:53.689> of<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.840> day<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.290> do<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:54.890> think

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
the question of the day is do you think

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.220 
the question of the day is do you think
these<00:03:55.280> pictures<00:03:55.730> are<00:03:55.760> real<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.930> think<00:03:57.110> that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
these pictures are real to think that

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.170 
these pictures are real to think that
animal<00:03:57.920> jam<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.430> actually<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.000> come<00:03:59.150> out

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
animal jam is actually going to come out

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.390 
animal jam is actually going to come out
this<00:03:59.599> new<00:03:59.780> den<00:03:59.989> or<00:04:00.379> do<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.099> think<00:04:01.159> it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this new den or do you think it's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.130 
this new den or do you think it's
