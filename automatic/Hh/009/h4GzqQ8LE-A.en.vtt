you feel like it it comes down to like

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.680 
you feel like it it comes down to like
who<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.000> partnered<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
who you're partnered with at the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
who you're partnered with at the
beginning<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.500> all-star<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> get<00:00:50.340> or

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
beginning or which all-star you get or

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
beginning or which all-star you get or
ultimately<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> still<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.870> as

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
ultimately is it still about like you as

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
ultimately is it still about like you as
an<00:00:52.140> individual<00:00:52.620> performing<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.640> think

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
an individual performing well I think

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.900 
an individual performing well I think
those<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.870> definitely<00:00:55.230> key<00:00:55.770> variables<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
those are definitely key variables but

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
those are definitely key variables but
in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> end<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.780> who<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
in the end it is about who you are as a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.380 
in the end it is about who you are as a
person<00:00:59.219> who<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> are<00:00:59.850> as<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> dancer<00:01:00.329> because

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
person who you are as a dancer because

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
person who you are as a dancer because
that's<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.170> people<00:01:01.320> connect<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.800> is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that's what people connect with is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.969 
that's what people connect with is
getting<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.960> um<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
getting to know you but I think um your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
getting to know you but I think um your
partner's<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.729> choreography<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.630> things

partner's your choreography and things

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.390 
partner's your choreography and things
that<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.290> given<00:01:07.590> help<00:01:07.799> bring<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> out

that you're given help bring that out

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060 
that you're given help bring that out
more<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.000> bring<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.020> less<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
more or bring it out less but that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
more or bring it out less but that
ultimately<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.610> ultimately<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> as

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260 
they you know some of them have more
memorable<00:01:34.979> routines<00:01:35.369> than<00:01:35.579> others<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
memorable routines than others and I
