that is the landmark of the avian seas
now<00:03:57.280> once<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.670> hear<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:59.129> level<00:04:00.129> 69<00:04:00.670> spawns

now once you hear the level 69 spawns
right<00:04:01.870> around<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.410> area<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:04.079> if<00:04:05.079> you're<00:04:05.440> low

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
right around this area so if you're low

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.430 
right around this area so if you're low
defense<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:07.150> might<00:04:07.329> just<00:04:07.450> want<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.810> pick<00:04:08.260> on

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
defense you might just want to pick on

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.190 
defense you might just want to pick on
him<00:04:08.650> because<00:04:09.129> he's<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:09.879> lowest<00:04:10.269> level<00:04:10.569> he'll

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
him because he's the lowest level he'll

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720 
him because he's the lowest level he'll
hit<00:04:11.379> you<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.620> least<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.099> he<00:04:12.220> spawns<00:04:12.489> back

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
hit you the least and he spawns back

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.970 
hit you the least and he spawns back
pretty<00:04:13.000> fast<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.540> it's<00:04:14.379> not<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.709> big<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.859> deal

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
pretty fast so it's not that big a deal

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.439 
pretty fast so it's not that big a deal
