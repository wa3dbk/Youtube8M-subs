that's<00:00:39.420> very<00:00:39.540> important<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.739> country

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that's very important if the country

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
that's very important if the country
ever<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> feel<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> it's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
heading in the right direction it needs

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
heading in the right direction it needs

sort<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> sense<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.030> chamber<00:01:09.450> well<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> think

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
sort of sense of chamber well I think

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.690 
sort of sense of chamber well I think
last<00:01:10.799> year<00:01:10.920> he's<00:01:11.130> trying<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.490> something

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
last year he's trying to do something

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.980 
last year he's trying to do something
totally<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.479> he's<00:01:12.600> trying<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> do

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
totally different what he's trying to do

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
totally different what he's trying to do
is<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> Republicans<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> realize<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is to get the Republicans to realize the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
is to get the Republicans to realize the
error<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.210> their<00:01:15.330> ways<00:01:15.509> let's<00:01:16.049> face<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> they

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
error of their ways let's face it they

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.620 
error of their ways let's face it they
never<00:01:16.890> will<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> happen<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
never will it's not going to happen and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
never will it's not going to happen and
I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> president<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.740> faced<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.340> now

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I think the president has faced that now

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.429 
I think the president has faced that now
so<00:01:21.060> tonight<00:01:21.390> rather<00:01:21.630> than<00:01:21.780> trying<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> win

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
so tonight rather than trying to win

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.649 
so tonight rather than trying to win
over<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.979> Republicans<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
over the Republicans and get them to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
over the Republicans and get them to
understand<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> they're<00:01:25.530> blocking<00:01:25.830> what

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
understand that they're blocking what

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.399 
understand that they're blocking what
America<00:01:26.670> needs<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.090> America<00:01:27.479> wants<00:01:27.810> instead

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
America needs in America wants instead

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.899 
America needs in America wants instead

support<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> great<00:01:43.979> majority<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
support the great majority of what the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.950 
support the great majority of what the
president<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.270> doing<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.810> our

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
president is doing we have our

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.420 
president is doing we have our
differences<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.070> should<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.340> been

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
differences I think we should have been

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399 
differences I think we should have been
in<00:01:47.520> Africa<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> Afghanistan<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> long<00:01:49.079> time

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
in Africa out of Afghanistan a long time

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830

ago I haven't pulled any punches about

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740 
ago I haven't pulled any punches about
that<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.850> unnecessary

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that I think that also it's unnecessary

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
that I think that also it's unnecessary
to<00:01:54.840> engage<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> pervasive<00:01:56.189> domestic

surveillance the president seems to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
surveillance the president seems to
support<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.979> by<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> large<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.759> issues
