00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 All good friends Swami Morocco 7 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.210
 today i would like to show you the fight on 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.010
 Fri-Sau 10 level Object 263 on the map 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 winter himmelsdorf 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.470
 I really like this Fri-Sau and I 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.020
 often showing you fights on her 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 because the fights are mostly on this Fri 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 get a cheerful and interesting player there 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 not just a whole fight in the bushes, but 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 going tanking cause damage in general 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 It works extremely fun and it's nice 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.110
 watch and the very beginning of the battle as you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.070
 can see object 263 not afraid 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 Fri-Sau Ferdinand and Isu-152 although they have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.770
 powerful weapon but if on site 263 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 hide nld 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.469
 how does the player then can be very 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 it's good to even tank once opponents 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.050
 didn't hurt our hero he is true 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.899
 then rolled back yet decided not to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 to risk against two ptshek and moved 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 on the right is true 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.260
 spent repair that of course not very 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 good because the repair may well 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.630
 need somewhere at the end of the battle 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 by the way i have a little good for you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 I began to write the news at last 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.080
 shadow play program who is not 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.560
 heard he will understand in general she allows 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 record video on the cards with the same forks 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 higher fps right now i am recording 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.159
 in very good quality and maybe even 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 you will immediately notice that it has become lagging 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.530
 much smaller and it's just super I'm 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.829
 pleased with the program and it is a pity that I 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 did not immediately use so recommend 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.990
 you her 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.390
 this is not advertising just such advice 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.630
 you if you want to record the shadow 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.030
 play fits very well for this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.210
 the player here as you can see begins 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.079
 shoot with opponents who 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.149
 sit there on the mountain 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.130
 although it is rather dangerous because 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.300
 from top to bottom they should like 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 wife punch more often our pawn but player 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.400
 still not afraid of them he is calm 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.080
 gets shot at with enemies they don't even 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 always shoot him because 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.989
 understands that object 263 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.170
 This is such a very strong goal that with 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.630
 long distance is difficult to break well 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.550
 further the player rolls back to 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.950
 get enemies who are 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.989
 right or at the position where he was 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 still perhaps got art so 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.099
 better get up right here lit up 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.650
 E75 from here you can see it very well. 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.030
 worth it but not strange not 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 manages to deal damage to him as well there 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 trying somehow 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.840
 tune damage at amx 50b shows and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.620
 only one tower but fails by it 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.620
 get to drive up very close long 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 insolently immediately of course grabs not 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.220
 breaks through our cheat support and object 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.190
 263 decides to take away from the left on him 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.040
 still leave the enemy breaks 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.769
 also batchat and on the right deals damage 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.560
 overall player a little bit but those 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.329
 no less on foot he took in the game wrong 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 too many cars that can 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.630
 really good to tank and object 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.810
 263 one of these machines of course if you 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.380
 know how to properly hide there tank 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.510
 nld somehow stand by the rum show the enemy 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.600
 cabin to shoot there and not 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.639
 then punched object 263 this 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.440
 really good choice for 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.609
 to irrigate there vytankovyvat damage 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.600
 basic is effective and it is in my very 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.750
 even cool going 3 foursome covers 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.079
 the board and in principle managed quite well here 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.549
 meet opponents but the truth is here 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.590
 the player can not no where hide nld and this 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.560
 the lack of this place is so better 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.040
 leave here and take another one 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.579
 the position is funny that this support even 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.829
 back travels 20 kilometers almost that is 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.680
 it is very good and 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.430
 speed you in battles to china just do n't 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 will and it can always come in handy 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.750
 leaves e 100 immediately snaps off 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.990
 and then the player starts to spin 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.840
 his note he logging cabin shows 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.210
 fact a big inclination thereby the enemies 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.020
 it is almost impossible to penetrate even with 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.900
 powerful guns and most importantly hide nld 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.449
 then everything will be fine because 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.770
 sometimes in principle this fri sau is pretty 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.530
 bat ny and punch there easily but if 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.680
 especially once agrit enemies give 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.629
 understand them here shoot dude i'm showing 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.639
 you can shoot you can shoot 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:03.060
 want it starts really 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.120
 shoot and end up just wasting 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.870
 time as you did at this time assort 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.229
 manages to pick up amx 50b here and on 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.409
 the player goes for e 100 tons leaned out and 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:20.159
 immediately flew into the hangar left 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.800
 destroy three arts and 1 bochata of course 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.659
 art is a dangerous adversary for an object 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.509
 because after all this fri sau 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:30.659
 open wheelhouse and if there flies 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.500
 high-explosive shell then the crew will not 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:37.409
 very nice i think so well the player goes 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.039
 look for arthur in this zone she is the last 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:44.490
 once shone and here and on the left is lit 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:47.069
 art batchat she begins to turn 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.909
 the player does not shoot at and takes it 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:53.909
 alpha enough everything is very good here 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.639
 on the right goes combo chat full confidence 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.490
 like pick up our pawn with a drum and 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.190
 let's see what he has out of it 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.319
 the object will be released on purpose 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.050
 roll back to the distance was 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:10.800
 maximum and here comes the Frenchman 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.349
 the object does damage to him batchata just 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.319
 going forward one time shoots 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:19.680
 horribly apparently he wants to spin the bag 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.780
 one more shot they have nowhere and in the end he 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.050
 flies somewhere here set 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.410
 there stops then moves out and 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.290
 the object takes him that's why he 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:35.520
 it was impossible to just get up quietly 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.190
 aim at this bldg and pick it up 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.010
 her with the help of her wonderful drum 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.690
 but instead he decided to spin 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:49.139
 object but he did not consider so small 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:52.169
 the fact that this fri sau good speed 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.840
 she turns quickly and so 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.960
 twist it extremely difficult besides 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.070
 her high dpm and until you get to her 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.680
 she will pretty much make out of you 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.380
 Happened to butcher me, of course 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.710
 Shoot anywhere on this Fri 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:13.470
 breakthrough is almost unreal here 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:17.100
 go out or trade tiger she shoots 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.229
 cause our hero 327 damage but our 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.530
 the hero takes the art and so let's 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:25.050
 look at the result of this fight 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:29.310
 medals wars basic steel gauge 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.070
 wall a lot of little honey master 10 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:36.120
 thousand four hundred eighty one damage hey 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:38.550
 the player struck down and destroyed seven tanks that 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.530
 not bad at all best in a team 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:45.840
 the enemy has played a game of 4 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:50.400
 well, that's it, and by the way another player 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:53.130
 chanted 7710 damage that shows that 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.380
 this giblets even very strong well 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.760
 now exactly thanks for watching 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.760
 see you soon friends
