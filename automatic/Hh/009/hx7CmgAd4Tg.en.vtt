the<00:00:15.509> three<00:00:15.750> times<00:00:16.020> rule<00:00:16.850> it's<00:00:17.850> good<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the three times rule it's good to

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
the three times rule it's good to
remember<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> cash<00:00:18.720> game<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.770> small<00:00:20.580> blind

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
remember in a cash game the small blind

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.790 
remember in a cash game the small blind
places<00:00:21.510> three<00:00:21.779> even<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.470> there

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
places three even though it's not there

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.519 
places three even though it's not there
it's<00:00:22.980> continent<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.460> complete<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.289> have

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it's continent is complete so if we have

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
it's continent is complete so if we have
under<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> gun<00:00:26.130> action<00:00:26.630> under<00:00:27.630> gun<00:00:27.840> action

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
under the gun action under gun action

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.300 
under the gun action under gun action
wants<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> bet<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> pot<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:29.070> would<00:00:29.220> be

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
wants to bet the pot which would be

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.260 
wants to bet the pot which would be
twelve<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> case<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.969> don't<00:00:33.149> just

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
twelve and in this case we don't just

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.120 
twelve and in this case we don't just
have<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> three<00:00:33.690> times<00:00:33.899> rule<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.710> four

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have the three times rule we use four

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.389 
have the three times rule we use four
times<00:00:35.160> four<00:00:35.820> times<00:00:36.149> three<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.290> twelve<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
times four times three is twelve so it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.920 
times four times three is twelve so it
gives<00:00:38.579> us<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> pot<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> twelve<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
gives us the pot that of twelve that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900 
gives us the pot that of twelve that
works<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.219> person<00:00:41.579> puts<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
works because if this person puts in

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
works because if this person puts in
their<00:00:42.059> call<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> three<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.469> bet<00:00:43.620> three

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
their call of three they can bet three

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
their call of three they can bet three
that<00:00:44.879> cold<00:00:45.180> counts<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.719> part<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> pot<00:00:46.320> they

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that cold counts as part of the pot they

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
that cold counts as part of the pot they
can<00:00:46.739> call<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> bet<00:00:47.820> three<00:00:48.120> six<00:00:48.539> nine<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
can call they can bet three six nine on

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590 
can call they can bet three six nine on
top<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.860> their<00:00:50.010> three<00:00:50.340> which<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> total<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
top of their three which be a total of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.220 
top of their three which be a total of
twelve<00:00:52.910> just<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.239> information<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.199> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
twelve just little information there for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.760 
twelve just little information there for
you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
you
so<00:00:56.070> moving<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.210> action<00:00:57.660> along<00:00:58.969> c8<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> going

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
so moving this action along c8 is going

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
so moving this action along c8 is going

to fold seed is going to fold c10 is
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> bet<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> pot<00:01:04.880> c10<00:01:05.880> believes<00:01:06.299> that

to learn some numbers times 3 and what
their<00:01:44.270> actual<00:01:44.569> answers<00:01:45.020> are<00:01:45.170> 42<00:01:46.039> times<00:01:46.219> 3<00:01:46.579> 3

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
their actual answers are 42 times 3 3

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.830 
their actual answers are 42 times 3 3
times<00:01:46.849> 4<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:47.359> 120<00:01:47.810> or<00:01:48.259> 3<00:01:48.439> times<00:01:48.590> 40<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:48.979> 120<00:01:49.159> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
times 4 is 120 or 3 times 40 is 120 and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
2 times 3 times 2 is 6 so it'd be 126

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.410 
2 times 3 times 2 is 6 so it'd be 126
plus<00:01:54.799> what's<00:01:55.069> behind<00:01:55.630> 126<00:01:56.630> plus<00:01:56.929> 12<00:01:57.289> plus<00:01:58.420> 15

plus what's behind 126 plus 12 plus 15

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
plus what's behind 126 plus 12 plus 15
plus<00:01:59.659> 18<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.679> 126<00:02:01.280> plus<00:02:01.399> 18

1:44 we can check that pot bet by going

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.400 
1:44 we can check that pot bet by going
42<00:02:19.640> times<00:02:20.640> 3<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:24.120> 2<00:02:24.209> 2<00:02:24.360> times<00:02:24.599> 3<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.489> 126<00:02:26.840> plus<00:02:27.840> 18

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
42 times 3 or 2 2 times 3 is 126 plus 18

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.880 
42 times 3 or 2 2 times 3 is 126 plus 18
that<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:28.650> behind<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.349> good<00:02:34.500> pop<00:02:34.709> out

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that was behind so it's a good pop out

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
that was behind so it's a good pop out

of 144 phone fold this person's going to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.289 
of 144 phone fold this person's going to
fold<00:02:40.980> their<00:02:41.160> 12<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.790> person<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.150> going

fold their 12 and this person is going

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.089 
fold their 12 and this person is going
to<00:02:42.390> call<00:02:43.160> 144<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> what's<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> pot<00:02:46.709> preflop

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
to call 144 so what's in the pot preflop

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.559 
to call 144 so what's in the pot preflop
is<00:02:47.489> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.790> 144<00:02:48.450> times<00:02:49.200> 2<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.709> be<00:02:49.769> 2<00:02:50.069> 88

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
is going to be 144 times 2 would be 2 88

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.600 
is going to be 144 times 2 would be 2 88
plus<00:02:51.569> what's<00:02:51.780> behind<00:02:51.900> 288<00:02:52.620> plus<00:02:52.920> 12<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:55.610> 200

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
plus what's behind 288 plus 12 is 200

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.259 
plus what's behind 288 plus 12 is 200
and<00:02:57.709> 206<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.920> there'd<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.129> 206<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> pot

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
and 206 so there'd be 206 in the pot

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.770 
and 206 so there'd be 206 in the pot
preflop<00:03:01.879> when<00:03:02.879> we<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.120> check<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.299> by<00:03:03.660> going

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
preflop when we can check that by going

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
preflop when we can check that by going
to<00:03:04.049> times<00:03:04.290> 144<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.280> there's<00:03:05.459> two<00:03:05.579> players

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790

for 144 and I will give you a 288 in

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.940 
for 144 and I will give you a 288 in
this<00:03:11.340> case<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.670> was<00:03:11.760> easier<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.269> add<00:03:12.450> 12

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
this case it was easier just to add 12

this case it was easier just to add 12
28<00:03:13.950> plus<00:03:14.250> 12<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.670> 300<00:03:17.150> plus<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.299> 6<00:03:18.709> will<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.829> 306
