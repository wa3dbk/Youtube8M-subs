pretty sure it'll be pretty easy to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.779 
pretty sure it'll be pretty easy to
learn<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.309> hand<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> left

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.390 
learn a lot of the right hand and left
hand<00:01:02.969> parts<00:01:03.420> line<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> same<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.559> you're

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
hand parts line up the same so you're

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.359 
hand parts line up the same so you're
playing<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> same<00:01:06.000> notes<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> each<00:01:06.450> hand

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
playing the same notes in each hand

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
playing the same notes in each hand
there<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.549> two<00:01:08.850> slightly<00:01:09.150> different<00:01:09.270> parts

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
there are two slightly different parts

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
there are two slightly different parts
here's<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> part<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.619> loops<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
here's the part that loops for the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
here's the part that loops for the
verses<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.080> snoops<00:01:13.560> rap<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
verses so when snoops rap in here is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
verses so when snoops rap in here is
what's<00:01:14.670> playing<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> background<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> if

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
what's playing in the background and if

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
what's playing in the background and if
you<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> sheet<00:01:18.119> music<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you look at the sheet music that I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
you look at the sheet music that I
posted<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
posted if you see a little thing that

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.280 
posted if you see a little thing that
says<00:01:21.390> 8vb

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
says 8vb

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.170 
says 8vb
that<00:01:23.130> means<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> part<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.880> actually

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that means that that part is actually

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.580 
that means that that part is actually
supposed<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> played<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.049> octave<00:01:25.439> below

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
supposed to be played one octave below

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.640 
supposed to be played one octave below
where<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.610> written<00:01:27.080> okay<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> bassline

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
where it's written okay so the bassline

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.429 
where it's written okay so the bassline
starts<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.130> down<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.229> pretty

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
starts off down here and you have pretty

starts off down here and you have pretty
much<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.799> same<00:01:32.009> notes<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:32.729> hand

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and the left hand then this is the a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
and the left hand then this is the a
just<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> comes<00:01:39.090> by<00:01:39.240> itself<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> again<00:01:46.439> here

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
just that comes by itself so again here

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it is now I'm just using the pan-flute

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
it is now I'm just using the pan-flute
on<00:01:58.350> top<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> electric<00:01:59.430> bass<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
on top and the electric bass on the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
on top and the electric bass on the
bottom<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
bottom if you want to really go the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.319 
bottom if you want to really go the
extra<00:02:02.189> mile<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.790> could<00:02:02.939> layer<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> couple

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
extra mile you could layer a couple

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
extra mile you could layer a couple
sounds<00:02:03.960> yeah<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.680> bells

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
sounds yeah I think they have like bells

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160 
sounds yeah I think they have like bells
and<00:02:05.310> strings<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.030> maybe<00:02:06.240> even<00:02:06.360> horns<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and strings and maybe even horns in the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
and strings and maybe even horns in the
right<00:02:07.740> hand<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> tutorial<00:02:09.000> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
right hand but just for the tutorial I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.760 
right hand but just for the tutorial I
thought<00:02:09.330> I'd<00:02:09.450> pick<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> most

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
thought I'd pick one of the most

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.700 
thought I'd pick one of the most
recognizable<00:02:11.489> se

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
recognizable se

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.380 
recognizable se
to<00:02:12.100> me<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> pan-flute<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.270> that's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
to me that was the pan-flute so that's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.230 
to me that was the pan-flute so that's
what<00:02:13.510> you're<00:02:13.630> hearing<00:02:13.810> up<00:02:14.290> top<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:16.030> wanted

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
what you're hearing up top if you wanted

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.510 
what you're hearing up top if you wanted
to<00:02:16.330> slow<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> down<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.800> original<00:02:18.130> tempo<00:02:18.400> is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
to slow it down the original tempo is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.940 
to slow it down the original tempo is
about<00:02:18.700> 82<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.380> get<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.770> bit

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
about 82 so you can get a little bit

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:45.210 
about 82 so you can get a little bit
slower<00:02:21.220> while<00:02:22.180> you're<00:02:22.300> practicing<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
slower while you're practicing and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.420 
slower while you're practicing and
that's<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.550> first<00:02:45.730> part<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.180> for<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> chorus

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that's the first part now for the chorus

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.310 
that's the first part now for the chorus
when<00:02:48.430> they're<00:02:48.580> singing<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.570> going<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
when they're singing it's going to be a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.660 
when they're singing it's going to be a
little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.710> different<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.190> first<00:02:51.340> measure

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
little bit different the first measure

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.210 
little bit different the first measure
is<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.060> same<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.630> then<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.680> second<00:02:54.040> measure

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
is the same and then the second measure

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.970 
is the same and then the second measure
is<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:55.000> little<00:02:55.390> bit<00:02:55.510> different<00:02:55.960> they<00:02:56.620> change<00:02:56.860> it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
is a little bit different they change it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.110 
is a little bit different they change it
for<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.100> part<00:02:57.340> where<00:02:57.370> they<00:02:57.550> say<00:02:57.700> that's<00:02:57.910> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
for the part where they say that's that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440 
for the part where they say that's that
and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.650> there's<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.890> little<00:03:00.270> part<00:03:01.270> at<00:03:01.360> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and then there's a little part at the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.700 
and then there's a little part at the
end<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.020> bit<00:03:02.170> different<00:03:02.320> so

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
end that's a little bit different so

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.470 
end that's a little bit different so
again<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.550> first<00:03:03.730> measure<00:03:04.000> stays<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> same

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
again the first measure stays the same

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.590 
again the first measure stays the same
here's<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.080> chorus<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.180> part<00:03:10.390> stays

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
here's the chorus then this part stays
