00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
from the flare base I was one of the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.160 
from the flare base I was one of the
worst<00:00:31.099> archetypes<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.610> rez<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.870> can't

when a needles they can't win against

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.200 
when a needles they can't win against
anything<00:00:37.020> people<00:00:37.800> would<00:00:38.100> rather<00:00:38.399> run<00:00:38.730> normal

anything people would rather run normal

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
anything people would rather run normal
monsters<00:00:39.660> than<00:00:40.170> run<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> stack

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
monsters than run that stack

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.389 
monsters than run that stack
I'm<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.790> saying<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.329> competitive<00:00:43.020> tier<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I'm not saying as competitive tier but a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
I'm not saying as competitive tier but a
lot<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> decks<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> show<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.870> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
lot of decks that I show are not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.100 
lot of decks that I show are not
compared<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.550> decks<00:00:47.879> their<00:00:48.510> decks<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
compared to your decks their decks that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
compared to your decks their decks that
are<00:00:49.170> fun<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.739> play<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.329> win

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
are fun you play them you can win

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.939 
are fun you play them you can win
against<00:00:51.840> dragon<00:00:52.230> rulers<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.710> there's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
against dragon rulers but there's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.920 
against dragon rulers but there's
probably<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> 1<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> 100<00:00:54.120> chance<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> do

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
probably a 1 and 100 chance that you do

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
probably a 1 and 100 chance that you do
know<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.219> I<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> show<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.510> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there was a time when things weren't

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.549 
there was a time when things weren't
broken<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:02.480> do<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.629> guys<00:01:03.870> understand<00:01:04.439> that

the TCG that's just one of these things

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
the TCG that's just one of these things
where<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> guys<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
where you guys kind of have to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.770 
where you guys kind of have to
appreciate<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.460> soundex<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:48.450> run<00:01:48.630> as

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
appreciate that soundex don't run as

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.100 
appreciate that soundex don't run as
fast<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.380> other<00:01:49.950> decks<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.750> doesn't

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
fast as other decks and that doesn't

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
fast as other decks and that doesn't
mean<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:53.159> broken<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
mean that they have to be broken just

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
mean that they have to be broken just
because<00:01:54.119> they're<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.920> as

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
because they're not as good not as

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
because they're not as good not as
