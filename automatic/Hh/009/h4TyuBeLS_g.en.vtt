00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.410
 and after I'm already in the middle of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.330
 Socken fever I really wanted my 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.670
 little monster socks show 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.920
 Of course I test a lot of rocks 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.550
 which I can especially recommend 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.240
 which he tend to gaps on the sides 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.939
 where you can absolutely avoid them so 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 You see, I'm not idle 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.279
 I still need a bit for it but me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 starting today we will indeed 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.250
 also pattern socks knit you a lot 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 pretty socks to show pattern too 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 very easy is a bit tricky 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.789
 it in one place this cute oblique 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:52.579
 What kind of slanted lattice is this? 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:55.050
 oblique ladder includes three rows 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.910
 simple rib pattern I will 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 they show right away on the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.660
 bottom of the sock I knit 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.189
 Of course, just smooth right 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.189
 we can always skip that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 and you had to start with that yourself 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.759
 three rounds a simple grid pattern 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.929
 and that looks like a mesh on the right 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.539
 two left one right two left one 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.819
 right time always so on so after 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.799
 Three rather a rib this pattern will be 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.509
 then gambled then please it will be one 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.359
 bit of sophisticated gambling you need 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.000
 no auxiliary needle with auxiliary needle goes 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.950
 even worse 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.259
 that means the first four stitches will be 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.099
 first gamble the fourth stitch 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.280
 right then stretched the second stitch 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.860
 left the third loop left and then 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.319
 the first stitch on the right so the stitches 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.280
 are knitted as they appear 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:06.119
 first four then two then three then 1 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.599
 and i showed how to make that kids 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.840
 also not difficult little exercise 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.840
 helps of course 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.940
 and there at the beginning to take care that there 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.160
 do not pull long strings 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.380
 so i want the fourth stitch of the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.740
 first four right knit I have them 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.620
 a little bit of a knit she knits 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.280
 from the front right now a bit 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 approach the previous needle so that he does not 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.390
 long threads arise 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.760
 Now the second machine is left 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.970
 knit well if you're right 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.790
 elastic can have the third 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.060
 Machine left knit my nails 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.459
 always keep the mesh apart 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.730
 and now the first thread after 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.740
 behind and the first stitch on the right 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.980
 stretch you see it then without 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:08.870
 blur like that and that's it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.080
 then two stitches left, I show it 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.570
 again from the next four 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.920
 mesh the fourth stitch again 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.650
 lift and stretch from the front right 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.630
 knit the second stitch left off all 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 needles remain still on the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.260
 needle 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.260
 Knit the third machine off to the left 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.600
 you will be the thread to the back and the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.240
 knit first stitch off to the right 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.730
 all stitches remain on the needle and 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.120
 now all four stitches down from the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:55.890
 Needle two stitches left and again 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:04:00.690
 gamble fourth stitch stretch first time 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.020
 second stitch on the left knit first 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:09.150
 the right second left third left 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.880
 knit thread backwards and the first 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.840
 knit all four right again 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.840
 mesh from the needle 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.010
 So you see, it's a bit 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.550
 but only every fourth row is tricky 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:27.320
 to plait and reward the pretty pattern 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.320
 even for the little extra effort 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:38.390
 is gambled on the pattern purely over 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.390
 the mosterei here until the last stitch 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.050
 and then there is a second braid 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:52.010
 it was freely shifted by three stitches 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.680
 so that's the last drop now 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:59.700
 mesh number 4 right stretch mesh 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:05.840
 Number two left knit stitch number 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:10.050
 Three left knit thread backwards 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.130
 mesh number one right stretch so 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.890
 that 's it with the plan now 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.870
 about three rows in one again 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.520
 same rib pattern knitted so also 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.250
 a mesh right two left one 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.630
 right before left and so on afterwards 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:35.680
 the second top comes free 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:40.930
 So the three had about rip 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.780
 mesh right two stitches left one 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.110
 mesh right two stitches left and so on 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.110
 continue 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.170
 and then again the next top free 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.340
 which works the same as the first 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.030
 we ended up with three stitches 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.030
 offset 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.620
 that means we knit one at the beginning 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.530
 mesh right two stitches left and 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:13.170
 then it is gambled a right two left 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.870
 and now we're just starting to do that 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:20.850
 from the next four stitches the fourth 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:26.210
 From the right , knit the second left 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:29.940
 Knit the third knit off to the left 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.310
 the first right stretch 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.220
 I've tried it with braid needles 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.560
 Does not do anything here that makes you her 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.480
 more complicated that is not here 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.880
 recommended and again two left and 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:47.780
 gamble again and at the end of this series 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.540
 ends again with three stitches 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.540
 Knitted so two stitches left one 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:59.790
 right because we put it that way 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:02.400
 then this pretty socks pattern will be 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.010
 Then we just become one 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.930
 write instructions and at this 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.230
 By the way, I have one socks 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.930
 I used the triple tip 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.230
 show you later 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.760
 and that looks very pretty like that 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.740
 So soon there really are those 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.740
 first videos
