going to be really bad obviously for the

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to be really bad obviously for the
collectors<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.980> what<00:00:27.220> they<00:00:27.310> do<00:00:27.460> for

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
collectors that's what they do for

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.279 
collectors that's what they do for
living<00:00:27.850> there<00:00:28.150> collecting<00:00:28.420> these<00:00:28.720> fish<00:00:29.020> if

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
living there collecting these fish if

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.050 
living there collecting these fish if
there's<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.560> ban<00:00:29.859> there's<00:00:30.340> no<00:00:30.550> need<00:00:30.699> for<00:00:30.970> them

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
there's a ban there's no need for them

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.360 
there's a ban there's no need for them
to<00:00:31.210> collect<00:00:31.359> fish<00:00:31.720> anymore<00:00:31.960> so<00:00:32.920> it<00:00:33.220> would<00:00:33.340> have

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
to collect fish anymore so it would have

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.970 
to collect fish anymore so it would have
serious<00:00:34.120> impact<00:00:34.570> on<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.900> collectors<00:00:35.379> there's

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
serious impact on the collectors there's

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.700 
serious impact on the collectors there's
going<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.220> be<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.640> lot<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.600> controversy<00:00:38.410> there's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
going to be a lot of controversy there's

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.579 
going to be a lot of controversy there's
a<00:00:38.800> lot<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.269> mixed<00:00:40.269> feelings<00:00:40.330> here<00:00:41.110> there's<00:00:41.440> a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
a lot of mixed feelings here there's a

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.680 
a lot of mixed feelings here there's a
lot<00:00:41.769> of<00:00:41.800> people<00:00:42.070> involved<00:00:42.460> in<00:00:42.909> marine

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
lot of people involved in marine

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.250 
lot of people involved in marine
collection<00:00:45.210> no<00:00:46.210> one<00:00:46.420> wants<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.839> see<00:00:47.049> them

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
collection no one wants to see them

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.950 
collection no one wants to see them
without<00:00:47.949> food<00:00:48.460> on<00:00:48.670> their<00:00:49.120> tables<00:00:49.629> at<00:00:49.780> night

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
without food on their tables at night

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.009 
without food on their tables at night
and<00:00:50.199> I<00:00:50.949> think<00:00:51.190> that's<00:00:51.400> where<00:00:51.699> there's<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.720> lot

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
and I think that's where there's a lot

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.110 
and I think that's where there's a lot
of<00:00:53.049> controversy<00:00:54.040> it's<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.489> business<00:00:54.850> they're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of controversy it's a business they're

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.240 
of controversy it's a business they're
in<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.299> for<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.510> money<00:00:55.570> if<00:00:55.960> they<00:00:56.440> their<00:00:57.070> other

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
in it for the money if they their other

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.070 
in it for the money if they their other
work<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:57.850> these<00:00:58.299> same<00:00:58.540> people<00:00:58.690> could<00:00:58.989> be

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
work that these same people could be

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.869 
work that these same people could be
doing<00:00:59.409> they<00:00:59.559> don't<00:00:59.769> have<00:00:59.979> to<00:01:00.190> take<00:01:00.369> the<00:01:00.580> fish

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
doing they don't have to take the fish

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.899 
doing they don't have to take the fish
and<00:01:01.360> export<00:01:01.809> them<00:01:01.989> from<00:01:02.199> Hawaii<00:01:02.500> but<00:01:02.979> that's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
and export them from Hawaii but that's

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.910 
and export them from Hawaii but that's
how<00:01:04.210> they're<00:01:04.479> they're<00:01:05.290> earning<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.740> living

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
how they're they're earning a living

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.160 
how they're they're earning a living
there<00:01:06.490> are<00:01:06.670> other<00:01:06.790> ways<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.390> earn<00:01:07.570> living<00:01:08.049> it

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
there are other ways to earn living it

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.249 
there are other ways to earn living it
why<00:01:08.409> if<00:01:08.619> those<00:01:08.830> fish<00:01:09.130> stayed<00:01:09.430> here<00:01:10.109> there<00:01:11.109> were

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
why if those fish stayed here there were

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.039 
why if those fish stayed here there were
maybe<00:01:11.710> probably<00:01:12.130> 40<00:01:12.670> times<00:01:12.939> as<00:01:13.149> valuable<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
maybe probably 40 times as valuable the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.170 
maybe probably 40 times as valuable the
same<00:01:14.350> people<00:01:14.590> who<00:01:14.770> are<00:01:14.979> collecting<00:01:15.549> could<00:01:16.060> be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
same people who are collecting could be

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.660 
same people who are collecting could be
taking<00:01:16.570> people<00:01:16.899> out<00:01:17.020> there<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.680> view<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.399> fish

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
taking people out there to view the fish

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.810 
taking people out there to view the fish
once<00:01:19.210> legislators<00:01:20.020> are<00:01:20.530> made<00:01:20.799> aware<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
once legislators are made aware of the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.240 
once legislators are made aware of the
facts<00:01:22.060> they<00:01:22.810> tend<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.289> walk<00:01:23.679> away<00:01:23.890> pretty

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
facts they tend to walk away pretty

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.889 
facts they tend to walk away pretty
quickly<00:01:24.520> from<00:01:24.789> any<00:01:24.969> kind<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.659> know

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
quickly from any kind of you know

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.929 
quickly from any kind of you know
sweeping<00:01:26.649> legislation<00:01:26.799> like<00:01:27.340> banning<00:01:27.729> an

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
sweeping legislation like banning an

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.969 
sweeping legislation like banning an
entire<00:01:28.240> industry<00:01:28.289> because<00:01:29.289> they<00:01:29.409> realize<00:01:29.740> hey

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
entire industry because they realize hey

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.310 
entire industry because they realize hey
this<00:01:30.009> isn't<00:01:30.969> this<00:01:31.390> isn't<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.689> problem<00:01:31.869> it's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
this isn't this isn't a problem it's

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.840 
this isn't this isn't a problem it's
been<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> sustainable<00:01:33.009> fishery<00:01:33.369> for<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.670> think

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
been a sustainable fishery for I think

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.999 
been a sustainable fishery for I think
35<00:01:34.600> almost<00:01:35.020> 40<00:01:35.289> years<00:01:35.320> since<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:35.829> first

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
35 almost 40 years since it first

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.919 
35 almost 40 years since it first
started<00:01:36.100> here<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.729> think<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.329> continues<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.840> be

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
started here I think it continues to be

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.130 
started here I think it continues to be
a<00:01:37.960> sustainable<00:01:38.530> fishery<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.689> issue<00:01:40.840> doesn't

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
a sustainable fishery the issue doesn't

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.080 
a sustainable fishery the issue doesn't
seem<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.469> be<00:01:41.560> resource<00:01:41.979> based<00:01:42.280> but<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:42.789> more

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
seem to be resource based but it's more

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.929 
seem to be resource based but it's more
of<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.270> conflict<00:01:43.929> based<00:01:44.829> issue<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.729> don't

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
of a conflict based issue I just don't

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.550 
of a conflict based issue I just don't
think<00:01:46.149> there's<00:01:46.299> enough<00:01:46.509> data<00:01:46.749> out<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:47.049> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
think there's enough data out there to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.380 
think there's enough data out there to
support<00:01:47.890> either<00:01:48.399> side<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.289> total<00:01:50.770> ban<00:01:50.950> or<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
support either side do a total ban or to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
support either side do a total ban or to
let<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.799> continue<00:01:53.799> at<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.700> current<00:01:55.030> levels<00:01:55.539> if

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
let it continue at the current levels if

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.929 
let it continue at the current levels if
continuing<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.249> current<00:01:57.549> levels<00:01:57.819> is

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
continuing the current levels is

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.209 
continuing the current levels is
definitely<00:01:58.450> not<00:01:58.569> sustainable<00:01:59.109> what<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.920> see

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
definitely not sustainable what I see

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.739 
definitely not sustainable what I see
happening<00:02:00.369> right<00:02:00.700> now<00:02:00.759> is<00:02:01.179> an<00:02:01.270> argument<00:02:01.450> that

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
happening right now is an argument that

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:02.840 
happening right now is an argument that
never<00:02:02.020> ends

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
never ends

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
never ends
I<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.180> never<00:02:03.299> ends<00:02:03.680> everybody's<00:02:04.680> fighting

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I just never ends everybody's fighting

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.140 
I just never ends everybody's fighting
about<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.400> but<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.729> does<00:02:05.820> anybody<00:02:06.119> actually

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
about it but what does anybody actually
