00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
think this bar can beat the Viper it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.490 
think this bar can beat the Viper it
didn't<00:01:30.490> launch<00:01:30.640> too<00:01:30.880> hard<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.390> don't<00:01:32.290> think<00:01:32.440> it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
didn't launch too hard I don't think it

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.750 
didn't launch too hard I don't think it
can<00:01:32.710> because<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.250> don't<00:01:33.280> think<00:01:33.520> has<00:01:33.640> enough

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
can because I don't think has enough

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.260 
can because I don't think has enough
traction<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.270> launch<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.660> hard<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:36.550> think

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
traction to launch that hard but I think

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.030 
traction to launch that hard but I think
it's<00:01:37.570> got<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.870> I<00:01:38.080> think<00:01:38.620> it's<00:01:38.710> got<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.890> Viper

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
it's got it I think it's got the Viper

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's got it I think it's got the Viper
beat<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.520> know<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.300> know<00:01:40.510> it's<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:40.960> hard<00:01:41.170> to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
beat I know I know it's it's hard to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.410 
beat I know I know it's it's hard to
hard<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.920> beat<00:01:42.070> eight<00:01:42.280> liters<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.760> v10<00:01:43.180> with

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
hard to beat eight liters of v10 with

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.650 
hard to beat eight liters of v10 with
with<00:01:43.750> four<00:01:43.960> point<00:01:44.170> three<00:01:44.230> liters<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.680> v8<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.280> I

with four point three liters of v8 but I

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.570
