dead we did plane before I believe we'll

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.830

beat<00:05:42.069> them<00:05:42.279> so<00:05:42.639> if<00:05:42.969> this<00:05:43.120> could<00:05:43.330> be<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.479> fairly

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
beat them so if this could be a fairly

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.499 
beat them so if this could be a fairly
simple<00:05:44.319> game<00:05:44.740> in<00:05:44.919> my<00:05:45.039> opinion<00:05:45.069> to<00:05:45.969> dominate

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509
