00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.050
 the first thing that draws attention to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.360
 samsung galaxy s 4 to its thickness 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.009
 it is the world's first smartphone to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 be less than eight millimeters 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.539
 it is also slightly lighter than the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 s3 weighing only 130 grams and this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.220
 prevented it from having a larger screen now 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 with 5 inches the s4 includes all 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.130
 modern technologies available 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 currently gps with gps and glonass 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 nfc bluetooth 4.0 up to network support 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.380
 4g Brazilian 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.079
 the user does not feel the lack of any 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.059
 feature in this new version in addition to 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.620
 samsung includes proprietary software for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 that the device connects with other 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.320
 devices using a network such as the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.329
 wifi direct screen from samsung 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.829
 was more concerned to include new features 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 in this context than with 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 hardware 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 the entire apparatus has new sensor 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.640
 a lot of applications 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.530
 own but it brings some 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 disadvantages such as higher consumption of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 battery and little space available in 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 internal memory 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 although it is sold as the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 16 gigabytes only 8 gigabytes stand 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.450
 available to the user because the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 other half are occupied by these 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.659
 data that comes from the factory 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.380
 the battery one of the most powerful 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.479
 available so far with 2,600 milleris 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 she was upgraded to give greater 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 the appliance but the combination of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 various sensors and very high screen 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 resolution causes s4 to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.540
 practically the same autonomy as the galaxy 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.189
 s 3 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.250
 he can only take one day off the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 taken and this with moderate use 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.479
 the model we receive is equipped with the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
 Qualcomm snapdragon 600 processor and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.290
 support 4g networks 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.149
 it can be found in stores in 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 white and black colors for the suggested price 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.280
 two thousand, four hundred and ninety 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.280
 nine reais 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.390
