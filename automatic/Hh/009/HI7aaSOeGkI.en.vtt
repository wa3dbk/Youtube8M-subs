00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.090
 Tell me, folks, I have to decipher a club. I'm a priest. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.770
 plants 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.599
 Today I'm going to show you how to play the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.610
 Simplified version of your song 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.410
 Starting capital way 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.779
 this song is very simple we have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.960
 just a rhythm and the four chords 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.960
 Chords are only higher in B minor 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.310
 it's bigger in there bigger op 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.050
 we'll do that way to most there 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.730
 facilitating change may be smaller now 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.570
 I'm going to play a piece of the song and then 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 teach rhythm 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.610
 she gave my arms love 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.679
 and I woke up without knowing if it was a dream and 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.700
 some time ago 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 I thought I'd tell you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 is 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.820
 I never fell into your love traps 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:04.680
 in that love to your general soul getting 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.680
 my time all night 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.070
 not return but pink zones 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.400
 Do not even think about telling our secrets. 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.820
 that grandmother in her own way 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.980
 P 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.980
 My time all night 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.020
 we are going to split the rhythm into two parts 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.020
 the first part will be like this 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.200
 We're gonna play twice, down. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.860
 down up down down up and down 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.860
 second part will be like this 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.920
 we'll focus on three times down 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.120
 It is the next 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.860
 always in the second part we're going to change 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.780
 the chord 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.620
 I'm going to play the whole rhythm now to 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.620
 you accompany 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 Good guys for today is this your 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.690
 comments below and accompanies the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.200
 other jewels here by the film hug 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.200
 see you next time
