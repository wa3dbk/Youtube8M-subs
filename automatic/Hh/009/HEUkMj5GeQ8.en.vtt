how<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.739> write<00:00:35.250> chords<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
how you can write chords that are to a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.990 
how you can write chords that are to a
different<00:00:36.570> style<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> do

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
different style so the first way to do

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.110 
different style so the first way to do
this<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:40.140> way<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.430> use

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this the first way that I like to use

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.350 
this the first way that I like to use
this<00:00:42.270> method<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.680> look<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> chords<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
this method is to look at the chords of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
this method is to look at the chords of
a<00:00:45.899> song<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.559> already<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> style<00:00:47.399> if

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
a song that are already in the style if

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
a song that are already in the style if
you<00:00:47.670> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.989> want<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.410> write

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
minor F chord progression which is a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.719 
minor F chord progression which is a
pretty<00:01:03.090> common<00:01:04.220> progression<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.640> go

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pretty common progression so don't go

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:16.230 
pretty common progression so don't go
like<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520 

so<00:01:17.240> let's<00:01:17.390> say<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:17.900> those<00:01:18.080> chords<00:01:18.439> you

so let's say you like those chords you
want<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:18.799> use<00:01:18.920> them<00:01:19.159> in<00:01:19.340> your<00:01:19.460> song<00:01:19.640> that's

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
want to use them in your song that's

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:20.980 
want to use them in your song that's
perfectly<00:01:20.330> fine

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
perfectly fine

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.230 
perfectly fine
let's<00:01:21.740> say<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:21.920> don't<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.939> take

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
let's say you don't want to just take

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.510 
let's say you don't want to just take
them<00:01:23.420> verbatim<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.350> want<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.250> know<00:01:25.369> give

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
them verbatim you want to you know give

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.710 
them verbatim you want to you know give
them<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.670> little<00:01:25.790> bit<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.090> twist<00:01:26.299> make<00:01:26.570> them

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
them a little bit of a twist make them

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.170 
them a little bit of a twist make them
your<00:01:26.869> own<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:27.680> one<00:01:28.280> way<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.790> do<00:01:28.970> this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
your own so one way that you can do this

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.320 
your own so one way that you can do this
is<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:30.170> can<00:01:30.380> now<00:01:31.070> reference<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.610> second<00:01:32.090> song

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
is you can now reference a second song

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.120 
is you can now reference a second song
and<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:33.170> could<00:01:33.320> take<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.530> rhythmic<00:01:34.100> pattern

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
and you could take the rhythmic pattern

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.639 
and you could take the rhythmic pattern
of<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.729> second<00:01:35.210> song<00:01:35.420> that's<00:01:36.170> also<00:01:36.470> in<00:01:36.560> a

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
of that second song that's also in a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.109 
of that second song that's also in a
similar<00:01:36.830> style<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.520> want<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.789> write<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
similar style that you want to write to

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.029 
similar style that you want to write to
and<00:01:38.299> you<00:01:38.390> can<00:01:38.539> put<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:38.780> on<00:01:38.930> top<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.170> those

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
and you can put that on top of those

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.359 
and you can put that on top of those
original<00:01:41.000> chords<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.770> let's<00:01:42.920> say<00:01:43.009> we<00:01:43.130> wanted

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
original chords so let's say we wanted

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.160 
original chords so let's say we wanted
to<00:01:43.490> write<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.880> rhythmic<00:01:44.119> pattern<00:01:44.960> that's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
to write in a rhythmic pattern that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.590 
to write in a rhythmic pattern that's
similar<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.710> Jack<00:01:46.250> Johnson<00:01:46.280> which<00:01:47.090> he<00:01:47.420> does<00:01:47.570> a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
similar to Jack Johnson which he does a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.059 
similar to Jack Johnson which he does a
lot<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.869> stuff<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:48.289> kind<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.770> sounds<00:01:49.039> like

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
lot of stuff that kind of sounds like

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.090 
lot of stuff that kind of sounds like
this<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.470> take<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.799> rhythmic

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this so now we can take that rhythmic

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.559 
this so now we can take that rhythmic
pattern<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.789> put<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.119> top<00:01:56.299> of<00:01:56.509> our

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
pattern and put it on top of our

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.120 
pattern and put it on top of our
original<00:01:57.340> C<00:01:58.340> G<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.090> minor<00:01:59.509> F<00:01:59.780> chord<00:02:00.619> progression

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
original C G a minor F chord progression

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:21.060 
original C G a minor F chord progression
and<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.459> might<00:02:01.789> sound<00:02:01.940> like<00:02:02.060> this

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.560 

okay<00:02:22.070> so<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.430> see<00:02:22.580> how<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.790> by<00:02:23.210> changing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
okay so you can see how that by changing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.390 
okay so you can see how that by changing
that<00:02:23.600> rhythmic<00:02:23.990> pattern<00:02:24.320> up<00:02:24.470> in<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.740> way<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
that rhythmic pattern up in that way it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.370 
that rhythmic pattern up in that way it
gave<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.790> chords<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.480> different<00:02:26.810> style<00:02:27.020> which

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
gave the chords a different style which

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.120 
gave the chords a different style which
is<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> good<00:02:27.740> start

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
is a good start

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.770 
is a good start
I<00:02:28.190> mean<00:02:28.340> we're<00:02:28.490> laying<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.850> foundation<00:02:29.600> for

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
I mean we're laying the foundation for

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.990 
I mean we're laying the foundation for
the<00:02:29.870> song<00:02:30.080> here<00:02:30.380> obviously<00:02:30.980> once<00:02:31.550> we<00:02:31.640> put<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
the song here obviously once we put the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.210 
the song here obviously once we put the
melody<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.320> can<00:02:33.470> change<00:02:33.650> things<00:02:33.890> even

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
melody on then we can change things even

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.490 
melody on then we can change things even
further<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:35.060> want<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.390> start<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.230> be

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
further but we want to start to be

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.350 
further but we want to start to be
thinking<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.580> changing<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
thinking in that way of changing the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.960 
thinking in that way of changing the
song<00:02:38.600> even<00:02:38.900> before<00:02:38.990> we<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> melody<00:02:40.010> so

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
song even before we get to the melody so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.520 
song even before we get to the melody so
one<00:02:41.180> thing<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:42.110> know<00:02:42.230> take<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
one thing you do is you know take the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470 
one thing you do is you know take the
chords<00:02:42.890> copy<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.730> rhythmic<00:02:44.060> pattern<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
chords copy the rhythmic pattern of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.720 
chords copy the rhythmic pattern of
another<00:02:44.720> song<00:02:45.020> like<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.500> saw<00:02:45.730> another

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
another song like we just saw another

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
another song like we just saw another
way<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.150> change<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.660> rhythmic<00:02:47.990> pattern<00:02:48.320> is

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
way to change that rhythmic pattern is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.530 
way to change that rhythmic pattern is
you<00:02:48.860> know<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.220> reference<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.850> different

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
you know you can reference a different

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.970 
you know you can reference a different
you<00:02:50.810> could<00:02:50.930> try<00:02:51.140> out<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.290> couple<00:02:51.410> different

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
you could try out a couple different

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.440 
you could try out a couple different
things<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.489> could<00:02:52.700> try<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.330> know

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
things so you could try that you know

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449 
things so you could try that you know
like<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.690> Jack<00:02:53.930> Johnson<00:02:53.959> type<00:02:54.950> strumming

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
like the Jack Johnson type strumming

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.040 
like the Jack Johnson type strumming
then<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:55.880> did<00:02:56.120> or<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.690> can<00:02:56.840> try

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
then I just did or you can try

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.840 
then I just did or you can try
referencing<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.560> song<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:58.010> arpeggiate<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
referencing a song that arpeggiate the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.550 
referencing a song that arpeggiate the
chords<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.780> now<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.080> take<00:03:00.200> those<00:03:00.320> same

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
chords so now you can take those same

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.590 
chords so now you can take those same
four<00:03:00.830> chords<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.489> play<00:03:02.120> them<00:03:02.270> maybe

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
four chords and just play them maybe

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:22.330 
four chords and just play them maybe
something<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.080> this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.500 

you'll<00:03:23.340> notice<00:03:23.550> when<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:23.790> did<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.240> also

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
you'll notice when they did that I also

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.210 
you'll notice when they did that I also
slowed<00:03:24.930> down<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> tempo<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.860> little<00:03:26.099> bit

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
slowed down the tempo just a little bit

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.250 
slowed down the tempo just a little bit
as<00:03:26.489> tends<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> happen<00:03:27.239> when<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.540> arpeggiate

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
as tends to happen when you arpeggiate

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.979 
as tends to happen when you arpeggiate
which<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> fine<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.800> mean<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.450> fitting<00:03:30.870> for

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
which is fine I mean it is fitting for

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.420 
which is fine I mean it is fitting for
the<00:03:31.080> mood<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.440> song<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.950> play<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.280> that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the mood of the song when I play it that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.600 
the mood of the song when I play it that
way<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> point<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.800> look<00:03:35.010> at<00:03:35.160> two

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
way but the point is if you look at two

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.070 
way but the point is if you look at two
different<00:03:36.000> songs<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.420> are<00:03:36.599> both<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
different songs that are both in the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.050 
different songs that are both in the
style<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.800> you're<00:03:37.920> trying<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.280> write<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> you

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
style that you're trying to write to you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.790 
style that you're trying to write to you
take<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.360> chords<00:03:39.720> from<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.080> song<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
take the chords from one song in the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280 
take the chords from one song in the
rhythmic<00:03:41.010> pattern<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.670> another<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.870> you're

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
rhythmic pattern of another then you're

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.470 
rhythmic pattern of another then you're
really<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:43.860> way<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> building<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.270> base

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
really on your way to building the base

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.390 
really on your way to building the base
of<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.750> song<00:03:46.020> that<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.860> style<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.310> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
of the song that is in a style that you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.770 
of the song that is in a style that you
want<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.910> don't<00:03:47.970> have<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.239> worry<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.569> much

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
want and you don't have to worry so much

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.610 
want and you don't have to worry so much
about<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.890> know<00:03:50.010> falling<00:03:50.430> into<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.730> trap<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
about you know falling into the trap of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.410 
about you know falling into the trap of
writing<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.769> your<00:03:52.950> old<00:03:53.280> familiar<00:03:53.580> ways<00:03:54.090> but

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
writing in your old familiar ways but

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
writing in your old familiar ways but
you<00:03:54.540> get<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.870> fine<00:03:55.140> if<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:55.560> what<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.800> want

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
you get is fine if that's what you want
