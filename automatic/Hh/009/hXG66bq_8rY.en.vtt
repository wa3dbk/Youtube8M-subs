ahead and life tap it up because we

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880 
ahead and life tap it up because we
don't<00:01:56.520> mind<00:01:56.840> taking<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:57.960> damage<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> our<00:01:58.710> own

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
don't mind taking some damage of our own

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.149 
don't mind taking some damage of our own
since<00:01:59.369> we're<00:01:59.549> trying<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> know<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.540> any

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
since we're trying to you know with any

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.789 
since we're trying to you know with any
swarm<00:02:02.159> deck<00:02:02.399> any<00:02:02.610> aggro<00:02:03.149> deck<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:04.229> planning

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
swarm deck any aggro deck we're planning

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
swarm deck any aggro deck we're planning
on<00:02:04.920> killing<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.790> early<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> mid<00:02:06.479> game

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
on killing them in the early to mid game

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.109 
on killing them in the early to mid game
so<00:02:07.020> taking<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.619> bit<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.860> damage<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so taking a little bit of damage in the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.859 
so taking a little bit of damage in the
process

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
process

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.690 
process
isn't<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> big<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> concern<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.370> us

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
isn't that big of a concern for us

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.369 
isn't that big of a concern for us
because<00:02:12.180> we're<00:02:12.360> hopefully<00:02:12.870> planning<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
because we're hopefully planning to

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.800 
because we're hopefully planning to
outpace<00:02:13.860> them<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.340> terms<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.819> damage<00:02:15.000> now

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
outpace them in terms of the damage now

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.540 
outpace them in terms of the damage now
he's<00:02:15.959> got<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> few<00:02:16.410> things<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.860> be<00:02:17.160> concerned

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
he's got a few things to be concerned

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.059 
he's got a few things to be concerned
about<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:18.030> he<00:02:18.150> does<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.510> some<00:02:19.440> removal<00:02:19.890> for

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
about here he does have some removal for

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.229 
about here he does have some removal for
our<00:02:20.160> creatures<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.760> fact<00:02:20.970> he<00:02:21.090> could

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
our creatures in fact he could

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.130 
our creatures in fact he could
potentially<00:02:21.690> clear<00:02:22.050> our<00:02:22.290> board<00:02:22.739> next<00:02:23.099> turn<00:02:23.519> so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
potentially clear our board next turn so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.430 
potentially clear our board next turn so
what<00:02:25.140> I'm<00:02:25.290> thinking<00:02:25.700> here<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:27.840> might<00:02:28.170> seem

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
what I'm thinking here this might seem

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.289 
what I'm thinking here this might seem
like<00:02:28.500> kind<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.190> waste<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.879> don't<00:02:30.120> want

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
like kind of a waste but I don't want

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.050 
like kind of a waste but I don't want
him<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.650> completely<00:02:31.650> take<00:02:32.069> my<00:02:32.310> stuff<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.819> next

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
him to completely take my stuff out next

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.869 
him to completely take my stuff out next
turn<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.290> kind<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> interesting<00:02:34.879> I'm

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
turn this is kind of interesting I'm

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.390 
turn this is kind of interesting I'm
really<00:02:36.269> thinking<00:02:36.720> about<00:02:36.830> popping<00:02:37.830> off<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
really thinking about popping off one of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.860 
really thinking about popping off one of
his<00:02:38.519> creatures<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.330> with<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:41.599> but<00:02:42.599> then<00:02:42.750> if

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
his creatures here with this but then if

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.780 
his creatures here with this but then if
we<00:02:42.900> trade<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.650> yeah<00:02:44.040> I'll<00:02:44.220> make<00:02:44.370> him<00:02:44.519> attack

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we trade that yeah I'll make him attack

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.130 
we trade that yeah I'll make him attack
into<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.329> we're<00:02:45.450> actually<00:02:45.540> gonna<00:02:45.780> get<00:02:45.989> rid

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
into it so we're actually gonna get rid

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530 
into it so we're actually gonna get rid
of<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.430> he<00:02:47.610> hopefully<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.150> only<00:02:48.269> get<00:02:48.450> rid

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
of that so he hopefully can only get rid

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.880 
of that so he hopefully can only get rid
of<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.900> our<00:02:48.989> guys<00:02:49.170> next<00:02:49.470> turn<00:02:49.590> we're<00:02:49.739> gonna

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
of one of our guys next turn we're gonna

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.920 
of one of our guys next turn we're gonna
do<00:02:49.950> another<00:02:50.190> flame<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.540> I'm<00:02:51.660> going

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
do another flame in and then I'm going

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500 
do another flame in and then I'm going
to<00:02:51.959> hit<00:02:52.230> him<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.280> was<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:54.480> know

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
using a shadow bolt on something with

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.490 
using a shadow bolt on something with
that<00:02:57.840> little<00:02:58.110> health<00:02:59.840> unit<00:03:00.840> normally<00:03:01.349> it's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that little health unit normally it's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.470 
that little health unit normally it's
again<00:03:01.829> do<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:02.220> really<00:03:02.579> want<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.180> but

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
again do you really want to do that but

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.970 
again do you really want to do that but

what we get and there is the win what a
perfect<00:04:13.410> example<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:14.190> how<00:04:14.450> this<00:04:15.450> deck<00:04:15.660> is

supposed<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.289> work<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.680> think<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:16.979> was

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
supposed to work I think this was

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.490 
supposed to work I think this was
literally<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.729> ideal<00:04:18.120> way

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
literally the ideal way

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
him early we dealt with some of his

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.120 
him early we dealt with some of his
early<00:04:23.510> game<00:04:23.540> threats<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.380> we<00:04:24.650> finished<00:04:25.010> him

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
early game threats and we finished him

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.020 
early game threats and we finished him
off<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.230> that<00:04:27.520> kind<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.640> ridiculous

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
