my hands on this one let's see what's in
this<00:00:23.010> box

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
this box

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.330 
this box
so<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.300> usual<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> packaging<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.830> very<00:00:25.890> nice

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
so as usual the packaging is very nice

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.450 
so as usual the packaging is very nice
DJI<00:00:26.910> always<00:00:27.359> does<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> good<00:00:27.779> job<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.460> but

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
DJI always does a good job with that but

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
DJI always does a good job with that but
since<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.359> expensive<00:00:30.769> multi

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
since this is the most expensive multi

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.010 
since this is the most expensive multi
rotor<00:00:32.009> thing<00:00:32.460> I've<00:00:32.669> ever<00:00:32.850> purchased<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.660> more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
rotor thing I've ever purchased I'm more

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.100 
rotor thing I've ever purchased I'm more
interested<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.559> what's<00:00:34.829> inside<00:00:35.930> first<00:00:36.930> you'll

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
interested in what's inside first you'll

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.459 
interested in what's inside first you'll
find<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> IMU<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> flight<00:00:40.020> controller

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
find the IMU and the flight controller

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.430 
find the IMU and the flight controller
and<00:00:40.710> receiver<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> LED<00:00:42.719> bluetooth

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and receiver and then the LED bluetooth

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.250 
and receiver and then the LED bluetooth
unit<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:46.289> pieces<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:46.890> nice<00:00:47.870> there<00:00:48.870> they

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
unit the pieces are very nice there they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
unit the pieces are very nice there they
seem<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.620> heavy<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.190> they're<00:00:50.820> metal

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
seem a little heavy but they're metal

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
seem a little heavy but they're metal
cased<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:52.710> they've<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.280> RF

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
cased so I guess they've got more RF

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
cased so I guess they've got more RF
shielding<00:00:54.360> than<00:00:54.750> their<00:00:55.410> previous<00:00:55.739> units<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
shielding than their previous units the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.049 
shielding than their previous units the
flight<00:00:58.770> controller<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> interesting<00:00:59.879> because

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
flight controller is interesting because

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
flight controller is interesting because
this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.680> DJ<00:01:01.680> eyes<00:01:02.070> first<00:01:02.460> student<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.940> a
