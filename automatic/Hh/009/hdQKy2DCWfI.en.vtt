00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
basically sitting duck because during

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
basically sitting duck because during
the<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.960> TV<00:01:31.380> missile<00:01:31.740> de<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
chopper is in freefall it's it's falling
down<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.079> need<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.530> sure<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.920> you're

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
down so you need to be sure that you're

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
down so you need to be sure that you're
pretty<00:01:39.119> high<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> air<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.310> when<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
pretty high up in the air and when you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.649 
pretty high up in the air and when you
shoot<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.729> missile<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> have

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
shoot your missile so that you have

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.600 
shoot your missile so that you have
enough<00:01:42.689> time<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.380> hit<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.890> target<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.430> then

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
enough time to hit your target and then

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.740 
enough time to hit your target and then
switch<00:01:45.390> back<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> start<00:01:46.140> driving<00:01:46.710> again<00:01:47.750> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
switch back and start driving again so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.139 
switch back and start driving again so
basically<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> perfect<00:01:50.250> situation<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.939> do

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
basically the perfect situation to do

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.530 
basically the perfect situation to do
this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.570> coming<00:01:51.930> out<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.259> deployment

this is coming out of your deployment
you<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.960> take<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> shot<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> tank<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.030> at

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you just take a shot at that tank or at

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.929 
you just take a shot at that tank or at
a<00:01:57.149> chopper<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.920> especially<00:01:58.920> since<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> don't

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
a chopper and especially since you don't

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.819 
a chopper and especially since you don't
have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> gunner<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> be

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
have a gunner and it's going to be

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
have a gunner and it's going to be
pretty<00:02:01.950> hard<00:02:02.280> taking<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.790> vehicles<00:02:03.750> so

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pretty hard taking out vehicles so

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.980 
pretty hard taking out vehicles so
shooting<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.680> TV<00:02:04.710> missile<00:02:05.369> will<00:02:05.659> either<00:02:06.659> get

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
shooting a TV missile will either get

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
shooting a TV missile will either get
you<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> kill<00:02:07.530> straightaway<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.069> most<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you the kill straightaway or most of the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
you the kill straightaway or most of the
times<00:02:08.879> you'll<00:02:09.330> get<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> disabled<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.289> then

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
times you'll get the disabled and then

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.830 
times you'll get the disabled and then
finish<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.009> your

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
finish it off with your

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.710 
finish it off with your
with<00:02:12.290> your<00:02:12.410> rocket<00:02:12.769> pods<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.540> from<00:02:14.540> what<00:02:14.690> I

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
with your rocket pods and from what I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.059 
with your rocket pods and from what I
heard<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> new<00:02:15.319> patch<00:02:15.530> they've<00:02:15.830> been

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
heard in the new patch they've been

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.729 
heard in the new patch they've been
buffed<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.019> we're<00:02:18.019> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.230> be<00:02:18.290> able<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.590> take

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
buffed so we're going to be able to take

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.410 
buffed so we're going to be able to take
a<00:02:18.769> lot<00:02:18.950> more<00:02:19.480> vehicles<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.319> also<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
a lot more vehicles it's it's also you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.449 
a lot more vehicles it's it's also you
can<00:02:23.599> also<00:02:23.720> take<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> shot<00:02:24.500> at<00:02:24.680> other<00:02:25.010> chopper

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
can also take a shot at other chopper

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.550 
can also take a shot at other chopper
it's<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> lot<00:02:25.760> more<00:02:25.790> difficult<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.540> hit<00:02:27.500> a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
it's a lot more difficult to hit a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.309 
it's a lot more difficult to hit a
moving<00:02:28.250> target<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> chopper<00:02:29.569> especially

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
moving target like a chopper especially

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.130 
moving target like a chopper especially
on<00:02:30.379> xbox<00:02:30.799> where<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:31.549> play<00:02:31.849> but<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.810> if<00:02:32.989> you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
on xbox where I play but if you if you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.920 
on xbox where I play but if you if you
lead<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.830> then<00:02:34.370> use<00:02:35.090> some<00:02:35.330> subtle

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
lead it and then use some subtle

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.320 
lead it and then use some subtle
movements<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.560> don't<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:37.010> know<00:02:37.129> move<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.030> TV

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
movements and don't you know move the TV

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.390 
movements and don't you know move the TV
myself<00:02:38.810> too<00:02:38.989> much<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> left<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
myself too much to the left and to the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
myself too much to the left and to the
right<00:02:40.489> you'll<00:02:41.120> hit<00:02:41.239> your<00:02:41.420> target<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:41.900> just

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
right you'll hit your target and just

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.949 
right you'll hit your target and just
takes<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.069> bit<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.580> practice<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.299> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
takes a bit of a practice and the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.390 
takes a bit of a practice and the
perfect<00:02:45.170> game<00:02:45.500> mode<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.890> do<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.160> is

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
perfect game mode to do this is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.020 
perfect game mode to do this is
obviously<00:02:47.980> rush<00:02:48.980> because<00:02:49.220> there's<00:02:49.579> only<00:02:49.730> one

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
obviously rush because there's only one

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.539 
obviously rush because there's only one
enemy<00:02:50.630> jet<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.860> know<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.310> down

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
enemy jet and you know when it's down

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.240 
enemy jet and you know when it's down
and<00:02:53.470> your<00:02:54.470> main<00:02:55.280> thread<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.200> art<00:02:57.200> art<00:02:57.470> tanks

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
and your main thread is art art tanks

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.819 
and your main thread is art art tanks
and<00:02:58.489> let<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.599> direct<00:02:59.989> hits<00:03:00.200> from<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> tanks

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
and let the direct hits from the tanks

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.100 
and let the direct hits from the tanks
as<00:03:00.980> much<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.579> as<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.299> soft<00:03:02.629> lon<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.989> know

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
as much as the as a soft lon you know

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.470 
as much as the as a soft lon you know
that<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.620> painter<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.489> basically<00:03:07.489> this

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
that the painter so and basically this

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.720 
that the painter so and basically this
situation<00:03:09.049> here<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.440> mean<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:09.950> tank<00:03:10.280> on<00:03:10.549> that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
situation here I mean this tank on that

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.850 
situation here I mean this tank on that
hill<00:03:10.970> was<00:03:11.000> locking<00:03:11.599> on<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.079> me<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> entire

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
hill was locking on to me for the entire

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.090 
hill was locking on to me for the entire
game<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.959> what<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.079> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.349> do<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.069> a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
game and what you want to do this is a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.190 
game and what you want to do this is a
perfect<00:03:16.430> situation<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.910> use<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.180> TV<00:03:17.600> missile<00:03:17.989> is

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
perfect situation to use a TV missile is

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.039 
perfect situation to use a TV missile is
get<00:03:18.889> out<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.400> range<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.660> salon

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
get out of the range of the of the salon

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.440 
get out of the range of the of the salon
because<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:22.010> range<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.940> software<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.420> a

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
because the range of the software is a

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
because the range of the software is a
lot<00:03:23.780> less<00:03:24.290> than<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.250> TV<00:03:25.489> missiles<00:03:25.970> so

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
lot less than that of the TV missiles so

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.319 
lot less than that of the TV missiles so
you<00:03:26.750> get<00:03:26.930> out<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.230> range<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.000> shoot<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.060> TV

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
you get out of range and shoot a TV

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.479 
you get out of range and shoot a TV
missile<00:03:29.840> at<00:03:30.049> at<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.560> tank<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.250> best

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
missile at at the tank that's the best

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.220 
missile at at the tank that's the best
way<00:03:31.730> that's<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.090> safest<00:03:32.450> way<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.690> take<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.109> out

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
way that's the safest way to take it out

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.860 
way that's the safest way to take it out
especially<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:34.010> you're<00:03:34.849> if<00:03:35.480> you're<00:03:35.630> flying

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
especially if you're if you're flying

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.979 
especially if you're if you're flying
solo<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:36.760> take<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> shot<00:03:38.060> at<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.209> time<00:03:38.480> here<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.750> got

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
solo so take a shot at a time here I got

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.740 
solo so take a shot at a time here I got
the<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.639> got<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.760> vehicle<00:03:41.090> disabled<00:03:41.599> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
the I got the vehicle disabled and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.750 
the I got the vehicle disabled and
killed<00:03:42.079> probably<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.370> guys<00:03:43.549> were

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
killed probably one of the guys were

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580 
killed probably one of the guys were
fixing<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.269> they<00:03:44.419> were<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.109> fill<00:03:45.440> the
