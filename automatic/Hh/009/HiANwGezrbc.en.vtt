correct position now when we'll start to

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.970 
correct position now when we'll start to
assemble<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.240> case<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.690> show<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.680> exactly

how<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:46.400> done<00:01:46.460> okay<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.470> take<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.830> foot

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
how it's done okay so we take the foot

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.760 
how it's done okay so we take the foot
and<00:01:49.730> the<00:01:49.940> fixed<00:01:50.510> point<00:01:50.690> brackets<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.530> amount

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
and the fixed point brackets the amount

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.900 
and the fixed point brackets the amount
together<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.250> only<00:01:52.370> really<00:01:52.610> one<00:01:52.730> way

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
together there's only really one way

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.219 
together there's only really one way
then<00:01:53.320> there's<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.410> dimple<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:56.240> back<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
then there's a dimple on the back of the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.850 
then there's a dimple on the back of the
other<00:01:57.800> bracket<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.640> needs<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> be<00:01:59.030> facing

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
other bracket that needs to be facing

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.719 
other bracket that needs to be facing
outwards<00:02:00.860> if<00:02:01.010> you<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:02.680> small<00:02:03.680> allen<00:02:04.610> bolts

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
outwards if you like small allen bolts

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.530 
outwards if you like small allen bolts
they're<00:02:05.090> good<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.050> outside<00:02:07.270> through<00:02:08.270> and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
they're good the outside through and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.650 
they're good the outside through and
then<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.590> knob<00:02:09.800> goes<00:02:10.010> on<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> back<00:02:10.660> over

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
then the knob goes on the back over

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.810 
then the knob goes on the back over
there<00:02:11.960> there's<00:02:12.830> a<00:02:12.890> recess<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.550> north

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
there there's a recess in the north

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.040 
there there's a recess in the north
which<00:02:14.660> catches<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.200> catches<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.860> dimple

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
which catches it catches on that dimple

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.800 
which catches it catches on that dimple
tighten<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> allen<00:02:18.860> key<00:02:19.810> okay

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
tighten that up with the allen key okay

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.070 
tighten that up with the allen key okay
that's<00:02:21.490> one<00:02:22.490> assembled<00:02:23.000> just<00:02:23.600> do<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> other

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that's one assembled just do the other

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's one assembled just do the other
one<00:02:24.200> very<00:02:24.230> quickly

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.080 

okay<00:02:28.470> now<00:02:28.620> we've<00:02:28.800> assembled<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.489> Pete<00:02:29.760> or

okay now we've assembled the to Pete or

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.050 
okay now we've assembled the to Pete or
for<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.110> bar<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> look<00:02:32.940> at

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
for the one bar now we have a look at

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.130 
for the one bar now we have a look at
the<00:02:33.230> bar<00:02:34.230> itself<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.180> there's<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> bit

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the bar itself you can see there's a bit

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.680 
the bar itself you can see there's a bit
of<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.319> curve<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> bar<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.239> inside

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
of a curve on the bar and on the inside

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.229 
of a curve on the bar and on the inside
there<00:02:40.620> are<00:02:40.650> these<00:02:40.800> kind<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.190> cortex<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:42.120> in

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
there are these kind of cortex now in

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.580 
there are these kind of cortex now in
the<00:02:42.360> instructions<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.790> tells<00:02:44.790> us<00:02:45.209> exactly

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the instructions it tells us exactly

we're going to mount the bars on to the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.880 
we're going to mount the bars on to the
roof<00:03:52.360> itself<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> first<00:03:53.440> thing<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.770> is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
roof itself and the first thing to do is

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.470 
roof itself and the first thing to do is
put<00:03:54.069> there<00:03:54.250> put<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.640> feet<00:03:54.819> into<00:03:55.030> place<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
put there put the feet into place so you

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
put there put the feet into place so you
can<00:03:55.600> see<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:56.050> they're<00:03:56.380> they're<00:03:56.770> angled<00:03:57.130> out

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
can see that they're they're angled out

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.680 
can see that they're they're angled out
that<00:03:57.550> they're<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.910> same<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.209> each<00:03:58.330> other<00:03:58.420> but

people we can do it yourself it's a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.530 
people we can do it yourself it's a
little<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.180> fiddly<00:04:34.450> we<00:04:35.140> just<00:04:36.240> guide<00:04:37.240> that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
little bit fiddly we just guide that

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.450 
little bit fiddly we just guide that
bolt<00:04:38.229> into<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.100> hole<00:04:39.190> on<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.610> buyer<00:04:39.790> side<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
bolt into the hole on the buyer side and

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.840 
bolt into the hole on the buyer side and
then<00:04:43.450> on<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:44.530> near<00:04:44.740> side<00:04:45.010> here<00:04:45.250> as<00:04:45.340> well<00:04:45.550> you

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
then on the near side here as well you

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.779 
then on the near side here as well you
just<00:04:46.810> drop<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.110> down

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.620 

there<00:04:52.789> we<00:04:52.940> go

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
there we go

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.350 
there we go
and<00:04:53.960> as<00:04:54.110> we<00:04:54.470> can<00:04:54.590> see<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:55.100> in<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.360> thousand

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
and as we can see just in a thousand

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.120 
and as we can see just in a thousand
here<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:57.110> make<00:04:57.289> sure<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.919> is

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
here just make sure that that is

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.060 
here just make sure that that is
straight<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.639> can<00:04:58.820> see<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.380> the<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.860> bolt

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
straight you can see that the the bolt

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.670 
straight you can see that the the bolt
going<00:05:01.310> into<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.789> threaded<00:05:02.780> hole<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.199> in<00:05:03.500> the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
going into the threaded hole in in the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.310 
going into the threaded hole in in the
group<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.039> the<00:05:04.130> car<00:05:04.310> now<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.630> important<00:05:06.080> you

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
group of the car now it's important you

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400 
group of the car now it's important you
need<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.560> tighten<00:05:06.800> up<00:05:07.389> this<00:05:08.389> bolt<00:05:08.690> person

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
need to tighten up this bolt person

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.140 
need to tighten up this bolt person
before<00:05:09.770> you<00:05:09.949> tighten<00:05:10.160> these<00:05:10.430> up<00:05:10.490> at<00:05:10.699> all<00:05:10.880> you

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
before you tighten these up at all you

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.610 
before you tighten these up at all you
don't<00:05:11.720> need<00:05:11.930> up<00:05:12.110> first<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.740> will<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:15.440> will

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
don't need up first you will it will

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.680 
don't need up first you will it will
maybe<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.820> angle<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.180> legs<00:05:17.360> could

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
maybe be the angle of the legs could

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.900 
maybe be the angle of the legs could
will<00:05:18.380> change<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.919> you'll<00:05:19.340> find<00:05:19.789> it<00:05:19.880> very

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
will change and you'll find it very

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.060 
will change and you'll find it very
difficult<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.479> get<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.840> bolt<00:05:21.110> into<00:05:21.710> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
difficult to get that bolt into the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.129 
difficult to get that bolt into the
interview<00:05:22.910> car<00:05:23.120> roof<00:05:23.479> of<00:05:23.599> the<00:05:23.660> car<00:05:23.840> and<00:05:24.050> you

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
interview car roof of the car and you

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.779 
interview car roof of the car and you
could<00:05:24.289> damage<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.680> as<00:05:24.830> well<00:05:25.009> so<00:05:25.190> tighten<00:05:25.729> this

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
could damage it as well so tighten this

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.450 
could damage it as well so tighten this
up<00:05:25.940> first<00:05:26.210> so<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.560> lift<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> up<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.160> you<00:05:28.220> can

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
up first so just lift it up so you can

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.680 
up first so just lift it up so you can
access<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.479> and<00:05:30.139> just<00:05:31.419> screw<00:05:32.419> it<00:05:32.539> down

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
access to it and just screw it down

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.240 
access to it and just screw it down
we're<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.110> doing<00:05:33.229> very<00:05:33.440> loosely<00:05:33.800> to<00:05:34.009> start

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
we're just doing very loosely to start

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.680 
we're just doing very loosely to start
with<00:05:34.400> make<00:05:34.610> sure<00:05:34.639> everything's<00:05:35.090> lining<00:05:35.449> up

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
with make sure everything's lining up

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.650 
with make sure everything's lining up
correctly<00:05:40.210> okay<00:05:41.210> now<00:05:41.389> when<00:05:41.539> you're

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
correctly okay now when you're

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.749 
correctly okay now when you're
tightening<00:05:41.870> these<00:05:42.380> these<00:05:43.039> bulbs<00:05:43.280> it's<00:05:43.550> very

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
tightening these these bulbs it's very

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.900 
tightening these these bulbs it's very
important<00:05:44.360> um<00:05:45.280> firstly<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.490> do<00:05:46.610> them<00:05:46.729> in<00:05:46.849> the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
important um firstly to do them in the

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.460 
important um firstly to do them in the
correct<00:05:47.090> order<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.599> that<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:48.020> ones<00:05:48.199> that<00:05:48.380> go

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
correct order so that the ones that go

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.360 
correct order so that the ones that go
into<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.770> roof<00:05:48.889> first

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
into the roof first

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.100 
into the roof first
and<00:05:49.669> then<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:49.970> ones<00:05:50.150> into<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.509> by<00:05:50.599> a<00:05:50.630> second

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
and then the ones into the by a second

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.460 
and then the ones into the by a second
but<00:05:51.710> the<00:05:51.830> next<00:05:52.099> most<00:05:52.460> important<00:05:52.849> thing<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.470> use

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
but the next most important thing is use

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.920 
but the next most important thing is use
the<00:05:54.620> allen<00:05:54.770> key<00:05:55.010> only<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:56.300> in<00:05:56.810> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
the allen key only in the in the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.390 
the allen key only in the in the
direction<00:05:57.139> specified<00:05:57.919> in<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.130> instructions

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
direction specified in the instructions

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.100 
direction specified in the instructions
so<00:05:59.830> don't<00:06:00.830> don't<00:06:01.820> tighten<00:06:02.090> these<00:06:02.360> up<00:06:02.419> with<00:06:03.050> the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
so don't don't tighten these up with the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.830 
so don't don't tighten these up with the
allen<00:06:03.320> key<00:06:03.470> in<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.740> position<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.510> only<00:06:05.630> in

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
allen key in that position is it only in

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.899 
allen key in that position is it only in
that<00:06:05.990> position<00:06:06.199> the<00:06:06.889> reason<00:06:07.280> for<00:06:07.400> this<00:06:07.520> is

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
that position the reason for this is

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.120 
that position the reason for this is
because<00:06:08.120> you<00:06:09.080> can<00:06:09.260> when<00:06:09.650> you<00:06:09.770> pull<00:06:10.039> you

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
because you can when you pull you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.649 
because you can when you pull you
tighten<00:06:10.460> these<00:06:10.550> up<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.979> amount<00:06:13.159> of<00:06:13.280> feet

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
tighten these up the amount of feet

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.939 
tighten these up the amount of feet
moving<00:06:14.659> was<00:06:14.840> slightly<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.289> you<00:06:15.409> get<00:06:15.620> too<00:06:15.800> much

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
moving was slightly and you get too much

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.070 
moving was slightly and you get too much
torque<00:06:16.280> onto<00:06:16.940> them<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:17.419> can<00:06:17.570> damage<00:06:17.780> they

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
torque onto them and you can damage they

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.290 
torque onto them and you can damage they
know<00:06:18.740> it<00:06:18.860> would<00:06:18.979> be<00:06:19.009> so<00:06:19.159> follow<00:06:20.150> the

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
know it would be so follow the

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.330 
know it would be so follow the
instructions<00:06:20.720> to<00:06:20.780> use<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.139> Arcadian<00:06:21.949> in<00:06:22.250> the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
instructions to use the Arcadian in the

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.339 
instructions to use the Arcadian in the
way<00:06:22.460> that<00:06:22.639> it's<00:06:22.789> most<00:06:23.000> prized<00:06:23.240> here<00:06:23.479> so<00:06:24.169> we're

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
way that it's most prized here so we're

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.110 
way that it's most prized here so we're
taking<00:06:24.650> off<00:06:24.800> for<00:06:24.949> now<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.370> we<00:06:25.460> can<00:06:25.490> there<00:06:25.940> and

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
taking off for now and we can there and

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.860 
taking off for now and we can there and
we'll<00:06:26.240> see<00:06:30.789> see<00:06:31.789> actually<00:06:32.150> probably<00:06:32.509> can<00:06:32.659> sit

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
we'll see see actually probably can sit

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.490 
we'll see see actually probably can sit
below<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.349> as<00:06:33.710> they're<00:06:34.130> tightening<00:06:34.340> up

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
below it as they're tightening up

that's completely fitted there now all
we<00:07:07.210> need<00:07:07.360> to<00:07:07.390> do<00:07:07.540> is<00:07:07.660> just<00:07:07.980> the<00:07:08.980> locking<00:07:09.310> covers

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
we need to do is just the locking covers

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.360 
we need to do is just the locking covers
on<00:07:09.730> and<00:07:09.760> then<00:07:10.150> we're<00:07:10.300> done<00:07:10.450> okay<00:07:11.130> we<00:07:12.130> have<00:07:12.250> the

covers here lumps on them on all four on
these<00:07:16.450> ones<00:07:16.690> I<00:07:16.870> think<00:07:17.050> some<00:07:17.260> coming<00:07:17.740> blocks

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
these ones I think some coming blocks

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.340 
these ones I think some coming blocks
are<00:07:18.490> only<00:07:18.670> two<00:07:19.060> of<00:07:19.090> them<00:07:19.360> and<00:07:19.840> no<00:07:22.350> they

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
are only two of them and no they

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.710 
are only two of them and no they

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
literally just slot over cover here into

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.409 
literally just slot over cover here into
into<00:07:29.290> place<00:07:29.500> like<00:07:29.710> this<00:07:32.850> turn<00:07:33.850> the<00:07:33.970> key<00:07:34.120> 90

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
into place like this turn the key 90

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.980

going to fit the rear bars it's exactly

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.540 
going to fit the rear bars it's exactly
the<00:07:42.370> same<00:07:42.490> process<00:07:44.070> okay<00:07:45.070> now<00:07:45.250> we<00:07:45.310> have<00:07:45.400> the

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
the same process okay now we have the

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.159 
the same process okay now we have the
the<00:07:45.730> roof<00:07:46.120> bars<00:07:46.330> fully<00:07:46.600> fitted<00:07:46.870> to<00:07:47.050> the<00:07:47.140> car

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.169 
the roof bars fully fitted to the car

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:48.810 
the roof bars fully fitted to the car
and<00:07:47.590> from<00:07:48.100> start<00:07:48.340> to<00:07:48.400> finish<00:07:48.430> including

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:50.710 
assembling the kids it probably took no

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.740 
assembling the kids it probably took no
more<00:07:50.860> than<00:07:50.919> 10<00:07:51.220> or<00:07:51.250> 15<00:07:51.640> minutes<00:07:51.910> one<00:07:52.570> of<00:07:52.690> the

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750 
more than 10 or 15 minutes one of the

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.840 
more than 10 or 15 minutes one of the
reasons<00:07:53.080> that<00:07:53.140> it's<00:07:53.410> such<00:07:53.950> a<00:07:53.979> quick<00:07:54.190> job<00:07:54.520> is

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:54.850 
reasons that it's such a quick job is

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.330 
reasons that it's such a quick job is
because<00:07:55.180> each<00:07:55.330> case<00:07:55.570> is<00:07:55.870> tailor-made<00:07:56.410> exactly

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.340 
because each case is tailor-made exactly

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.240 
because each case is tailor-made exactly
-<00:07:57.520> to<00:07:57.820> make<00:07:58.300> a<00:07:58.330> model<00:07:58.750> of<00:07:58.810> car<00:07:59.050> which<00:08:00.010> means

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.250 
- to make a model of car which means

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.460 
- to make a model of car which means
