00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.580
 He leaves the grave of the third day in the morning 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:49.300
 An unfaithful nation will be frightened 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:00.560

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:03.960
 About your church. Alleluia! 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:13.460
 5. He does not stop with the infidel people anymore, 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:23.560
