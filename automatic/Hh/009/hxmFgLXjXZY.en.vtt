let's say you're running minecraft or
some<00:01:47.820> desktop<00:01:48.300> game<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:49.020> uncheck<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
some desktop game you can uncheck that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
some desktop game you can uncheck that
box<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.610> automatically<00:01:51.119> record

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
box and it will automatically record

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.090 
box and it will automatically record
that<00:01:51.930> aim<00:01:52.289> now<00:01:53.160> next<00:01:53.460> step<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.560> FPS

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that aim now next step this is the FPS

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.700 
that aim now next step this is the FPS
where<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.789> will<00:01:57.000> show<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.810> frames<00:01:58.110> per<00:01:58.320> second

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
where it will show the frames per second

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
where it will show the frames per second
so<00:01:59.550> like<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.180> example<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.660> could<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.080> up

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
so like for example I could have it up

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
so like for example I could have it up
in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> corner<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.090> or<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
in the corner here or I could have in

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
in the corner here or I could have in
the<00:02:03.690> right-hand<00:02:04.140> corner<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.860> bottom<00:02:05.220> left

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the right-hand corner or bottom left

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
the right-hand corner or bottom left
hand<00:02:05.430> corner<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.030> bottom<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.750> corner

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
hand corner and bottom right here corner

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.810 
hand corner and bottom right here corner

pretty sure anyway next up movies to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.880 
pretty sure anyway next up movies to
record<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.970> default<00:02:24.330> key<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.780> f<00:02:25.049> 9<00:02:25.350> that's<00:02:25.769> how

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
record the default key is f 9 that's how

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.670 
record the default key is f 9 that's how
to<00:02:25.950> record<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.489> stop<00:02:26.760> recording<00:02:27.380> also<00:02:28.380> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
gigantic file which is like four six

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.710 
gigantic file which is like four six
gigabytes<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:35.100> will<00:02:35.549> bring<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.940> from<00:02:36.299> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
gigabytes you will bring this from you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.620

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.400 
off multi-channel and put on stereo now
the<00:03:02.940> only<00:03:03.180> reason<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.019> would<00:03:04.110> put<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> on

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the only reason that you would put it on

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.930 
the only reason that you would put it on
stereo<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.920> if<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.160> wanted<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.459> record<00:03:05.760> what

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
stereo is if you wanted to record what

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.160 
stereo is if you wanted to record what
you<00:03:06.030> were<00:03:06.150> hearing<00:03:06.450> through<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> computer

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you were hearing through the computer

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.110 
you were hearing through the computer
it's<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.100> let's<00:03:08.280> say<00:03:08.340> you're<00:03:08.489> playing<00:03:08.700> music

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it's like let's say you're playing music

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's like let's say you're playing music
it<00:03:09.269> would<00:03:09.420> take<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.870> music<00:03:10.049> from<00:03:10.440> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
it would take the music from the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.970 
it would take the music from the
speakers<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.510> record<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.920> so

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
speakers and record it so

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.740 
speakers and record it so
what<00:03:15.980> else<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.280> can<00:03:16.430> hide<00:03:16.640> your<00:03:16.910> mouse<00:03:17.120> like

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
what else you can hide your mouse like

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.630 
what else you can hide your mouse like
that<00:03:18.020> now<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.190> see<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.940> do<00:03:20.620> I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
that now you don't see it and I do I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.210 
that now you don't see it and I do I
think<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.150> about<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.950> guess<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.190> more

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
think that is about it guess one more
