idea<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.019> got<00:00:10.230> these<00:00:10.500> cases<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.940> made<00:00:12.120> a

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
idea I got these cases and I made a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
idea I got these cases and I made a
video<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> long<00:00:13.049> time<00:00:13.290> ago<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.799> most

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
video on this a long time ago but most

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.490 
video on this a long time ago but most
you<00:00:14.219> probably<00:00:14.460> never<00:00:14.639> saw<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:16.320> get

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you probably never saw it and you get

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
you probably never saw it and you get
these<00:00:16.650> cases<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> hobby<00:00:18.000> store<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
these cases in like a hobby store I

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.179 
these cases in like a hobby store I
think<00:00:18.690> these<00:00:19.080> actually<00:00:19.470> came<00:00:19.680> from<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.949> website

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
think these actually came from a website

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.240 
think these actually came from a website
called<00:00:20.430> terra<00:00:21.029> hobbies<00:00:21.510> calm<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.529> I'll<00:00:23.010> put<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
called terra hobbies calm and I'll put a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.859 
called terra hobbies calm and I'll put a
link<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> description<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
link to that in the description and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.890 
link to that in the description and
they're<00:00:25.529> usually<00:00:25.710> buy<00:00:26.070> two<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.580> $15<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.750> what

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
they're usually buy two for $15 and what

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990 
they're usually buy two for $15 and what
I<00:00:27.930> initially<00:00:28.830> did<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.310> something<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.789> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
I initially did was something like this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.209 
I initially did was something like this
where<00:00:30.269> he's<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:30.740> minifigs<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.920> there

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
where he's just had minifigs in there

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.660 
where he's just had minifigs in there
and<00:00:32.850> collectible<00:00:33.480> minifigs<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> all

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
and collectible minifigs and this is all

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.860 
and collectible minifigs and this is all
sigfigs<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.850> basically<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.780> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
sigfigs so basically I just kind of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.430 
sigfigs so basically I just kind of
built<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.340> some<00:00:38.460> bricks<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.540> even

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
built up just some bricks and I even

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.860 
built up just some bricks and I even
used<00:00:40.739> some<00:00:40.890> DUPLO<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> fill<00:00:42.750> up

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
used some DUPLO in here just to fill up

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.819 
used some DUPLO in here just to fill up
some<00:00:43.020> space<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.960> works<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.530> good

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
some space so that works out pretty good

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
some space so that works out pretty good
just<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> keep<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.700> getting<00:00:47.879> dusty<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:49.200> I

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
enough so that you can put some of the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.050

other<00:01:06.060> minifigs<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.470> got<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
other minifigs or like I got the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
really the problem I think with a lot of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
really the problem I think with a lot of
the<00:01:13.010> display<00:01:14.010> cases<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.790> Lego<00:01:15.210> makes<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the display cases that Lego makes you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.310 
the display cases that Lego makes you
just<00:01:16.470> can't<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.670> Hulk<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
just can't put like the Hulk or a lot of

for<00:02:57.100> two<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.459> $15<00:02:58.299> which<00:02:59.109> isn't<00:02:59.500> cheap<00:02:59.799> but

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
for two for $15 which isn't cheap but

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.240 
for two for $15 which isn't cheap but
when<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.549> about<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.299> cost<00:03:01.569> of<00:03:02.250> display

when you think about the cost of display
cases<00:03:03.549> there<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.390> get<00:03:04.540> expensive

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
cases there they get expensive

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.289
