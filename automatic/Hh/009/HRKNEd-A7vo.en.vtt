click it you get this menu which like

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.239 
click it you get this menu which like
you<00:00:47.179> can<00:00:47.390> choose<00:00:47.659> whatever<00:00:48.109> mob<00:00:48.679> we<00:00:48.890> want<00:00:49.100> to

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
you can choose whatever mob we want to

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.149 
you can choose whatever mob we want to
spawn<00:00:49.569> so<00:00:50.569> if<00:00:50.659> we<00:00:50.809> want<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.109> spawn<00:00:51.620> like<00:00:51.829> a

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
spawn so if we want to spawn like a

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.809 
spawn so if we want to spawn like a
bunch<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.579> guests<00:00:53.089> we<00:00:53.329> choose<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.819> then

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
bunch of guests we choose that and then

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:01.090 
bunch of guests we choose that and then
we<00:00:56.679> let<00:00:57.679> it<00:00:57.800> spawn<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:59.899> look<00:01:00.079> kind<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.440> kind<00:01:00.920> of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
we let it spawn you look kind of kind of

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.049 
we let it spawn you look kind of kind of
ridiculous<00:01:02.170> then<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.469> one<00:01:03.769> then<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.850> fly

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
ridiculous then this one then just fly

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.330 
ridiculous then this one then just fly
around<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.390> place

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.910 

so<00:01:12.329> the<00:01:12.450> basic<00:01:12.780> rule<00:01:12.990> goes<00:01:13.259> with<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.649> motto

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so the basic rule goes with this motto

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.880 
so the basic rule goes with this motto
but<00:01:14.429> when<00:01:14.670> they<00:01:14.850> spin<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.200> been<00:01:16.409> faster<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
but when they spin this been faster and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.709 
but when they spin this been faster and
faster<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.579> when<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.939> been<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> fastest

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
faster and when it's been at the fastest

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.270 
faster and when it's been at the fastest
this<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.179> I<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.979> now<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.039> have<00:01:23.250> a
