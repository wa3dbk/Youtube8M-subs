00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and made them keep playing now I think

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
way the game was played I think Germany

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.359 
way the game was played I think Germany
was<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> better<00:01:25.439> team<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.070> Germany

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
was a better team and I think Germany

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.490 
was a better team and I think Germany
might<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.080> England<00:01:28.080> deserves<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
might have one but England deserves a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
might have one but England deserves a
fair<00:01:28.619> chance<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.579> coach<00:01:29.820> said<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
fair chance and like the coach said the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
fair chance and like the coach said the
technology's<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:30.930> why<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> sit

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
technology's there why do we have to sit

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.730 
technology's there why do we have to sit
here<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.630> talk<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.500> can't<00:01:34.710> we
