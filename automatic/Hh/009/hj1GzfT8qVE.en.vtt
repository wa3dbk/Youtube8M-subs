00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.899
 that I wanted to tell you else 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.329
 yes then in fact this video it's 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.649
 passed in several times since in 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.690
 a first time already I have you 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.129
 thanked for the 3000 subscribers but I 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.239
 will also do other things 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.719
 because in fact I make you 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.370
 Classified 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.320
 and also show you the new 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.199
 material that I received recently because 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.149
 that yes I bought a new toy and 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.440
 so here I am going to explain a little 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.780
 how does it work 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.820
 and this new toy so here it is so 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 if he still packaged in his packaging 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.640
 dhl already a lot a very cardboard 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.799
 since it actually contains a device 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 so I'm going to get the weeks to 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.490
 come 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.850
 and after car from this carton well 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.100
 we have 6 6 and then of nintendo 3ds and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.020
 xl red color normal month but by 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 against I let this escape 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.049
 it's a usb cable everything there is 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.900
 more banal and in this micro 3ds you 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.730
 going to know is that there are more single 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:50.050
 compared to 3 different spells already the 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.670
 small fracture to the bone and the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.190
 installation instructions that will 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.280
 actually heals the instructions 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.990
 except that I was not looking later 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 of course the documentation with the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.940
 fists of tendo and with the cards of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.730
 augmented reality and of course the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.380
 famous Nintendo 3ds console so she 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.940
 I did not have the choice of color but 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.400
 it's not very serious dark it's still a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.450
 unit of 3.6 m there is also a 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.680
 difference is that you will see 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.570
 it's actually there is a different thing 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.820
 is that here it is a USB connection and 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.470
 that's why there's this famous 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.620
 usb entry because actually it is 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.880
 ordered a nintendo 3ds with the captured 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.440
 board dudes makes it a map 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.020
 acquisition that allows you to record 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 his letters blowing on the computer and 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 so I'm going to do the installation 2 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.490
 little nervous they are at the computer 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
 since there is the software that provides 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.670
 after installing the driver that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.860
 were provided by the website 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.110
 which allows us to install the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.800
 software to use the 3ds on 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.720
 computer 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 and that's what it gives 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.630
 the current mans I'm trying to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.180
 transfer the world data in my 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.000
 old 3ds towards the new so you 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.580
 see now on the screen so know 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.750
 that for but the wounds on 3ds that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.420
 will be really helpful 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.700
 so know that to be able to acquire this 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.910
 kind of material you have to count 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.590
 about 400 euros so without counting the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.330
 postage so normally it's him 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.980
 does less 400 euros will launch on 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.920
 price that I have pretty much paid in 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.290
 dollars but actually I got it for 360 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.630
 and a few euros for a 3ds that 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.200
 allows you to record live 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.070
 like this so here I hope I 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.810
 can you explain very 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.510
 soon in an explanatory video 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 how to make live with the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 free software like for example 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.430
 open broadcaster so I know that I 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.920
 am currently charging for that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.630
 this sequence since I tried 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.310
 many others but except that I have been 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.160
 pretty disappointed or so because they were 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.950
 pay now so now game we're going 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.799

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.180

 first time I just wanted 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.850

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.440
