00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
well this is what 100 kilos looks like

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.400 
well this is what 100 kilos looks like
and<00:00:07.500> that's<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.429> John<00:00:09.150> Gabriel<00:00:09.720> managed<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and that's what John Gabriel managed to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.830 
and that's what John Gabriel managed to
lose<00:00:10.620> without<00:00:11.099> dieting<00:00:12.090> that's<00:00:12.300> John<00:00:12.599> there

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.200 
lose without dieting that's John there
in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> before<00:00:13.440> shot<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.150> he

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
in the before shot and this is what he

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
in the before shot and this is what he
looked<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.480> when<00:00:15.840> he<00:00:15.870> weighed<00:00:16.369> 186<00:00:17.369> kilos

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
looked like when he weighed 186 kilos

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
looked like when he weighed 186 kilos
but<00:00:18.089> the<00:00:18.509> weight<00:00:18.689> came<00:00:18.989> off<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.560> he<00:00:19.829> kept<00:00:20.069> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
but the weight came off and he kept on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.179 
but the weight came off and he kept on
getting<00:00:20.429> slimmer<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.179> slimmer<00:00:21.319> and<00:00:22.319> this<00:00:22.890> is

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
getting slimmer and slimmer and this is

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.880 
getting slimmer and slimmer and this is
what<00:00:23.489> he<00:00:23.669> looks<00:00:23.849> like<00:00:23.970> right<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.589> I<00:00:25.710> had<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
what he looks like right now and I had a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.499 
what he looks like right now and I had a
very<00:00:26.039> solid<00:00:26.279> biochemistry<00:00:26.939> background<00:00:27.390> from

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
very solid biochemistry background from

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.729 
very solid biochemistry background from
the<00:00:27.630> University<00:00:27.989> of<00:00:28.019> Pennsylvania<00:00:28.589> and<00:00:28.649> I

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
the University of Pennsylvania and I

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.129 
the University of Pennsylvania and I
gave<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:29.009> enough<00:00:29.249> of<00:00:29.729> a<00:00:29.849> background<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.539> go

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:31.139 
gave me enough of a background to go

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:32.389 
gave me enough of a background to go
through<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.559> all<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> research<00:00:31.889> on<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
through and do all the research on the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.189 
through and do all the research on the
internet<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.359> spent<00:00:33.629> hours<00:00:33.929> a<00:00:33.960> day

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
internet and I spent hours a day

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.110 
internet and I spent hours a day
studying<00:00:34.829> biochemistry<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.699> I<00:00:35.730> discovered

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
studying biochemistry and I discovered

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.729 
studying biochemistry and I discovered
something<00:00:36.269> really<00:00:36.870> incredible<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
something really incredible and that is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.279 
something really incredible and that is
that<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.309> bodies<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> fat<00:00:39.089> switch<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
that our bodies have a fat switch and

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.470 
that our bodies have a fat switch and
this<00:00:41.039> is<00:00:41.160> part<00:00:41.339> of<00:00:41.370> our<00:00:41.460> genetic<00:00:41.579> program<00:00:42.300> our

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
this is part of our genetic program our

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
this is part of our genetic program our
genetic<00:00:42.809> hearted<00:00:43.109> when<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.710> fats<00:00:44.039> which

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
genetic hearted when this fats which

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.090 
genetic hearted when this fats which
gets<00:00:44.850> activated<00:00:45.469> your<00:00:46.469> body<00:00:46.679> goes<00:00:46.859> into<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
gets activated your body goes into that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.829 
gets activated your body goes into that
storage<00:00:47.460> mode<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.449> gain<00:00:48.600> weight

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
storage mode and you will gain weight

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.779 
storage mode and you will gain weight
now<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:49.829> look<00:00:49.949> incredible<00:00:50.370> saw<00:00:50.519> how<00:00:50.699> much
