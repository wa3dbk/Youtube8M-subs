for about two years now and there's
something<00:00:44.290> really<00:00:44.470> interesting<00:00:44.740> that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
something really interesting that

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
weights and you share this with somebody

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.280 
weights and you share this with somebody
there's<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.330> moment<00:00:49.510> where<00:00:49.720> they<00:00:49.870> step<00:00:50.079> back

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
there's this moment where they step back

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.630 
there's this moment where they step back
and<00:00:50.560> they<00:00:50.650> look<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.220> up<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.400> down<00:00:51.610> and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
and they look you up and down and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.120 
and they look you up and down and
they're<00:00:51.970> like<00:00:52.000> hmm<00:00:52.840> how<00:00:53.380> much<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.740> she-hulk

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
they're like hmm how much of a she-hulk

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.240 
they're like hmm how much of a she-hulk
is<00:00:54.340> she<00:00:54.460> under<00:00:54.579> those<00:00:54.730> clothes<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:57.010> woman

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
is she under those clothes is this woman

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.840 
is she under those clothes is this woman
a<00:00:57.610> monster<00:00:59.010> and<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.550> think<00:01:00.610> this<00:01:00.790> is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
a monster and I think this is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.180 
a monster and I think this is
fundamentally<00:01:01.630> based<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.290> few<00:01:02.500> myths<00:01:02.770> that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
fundamentally based on a few myths that

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.530 
fundamentally based on a few myths that
are<00:01:03.250> out<00:01:03.460> there<00:01:03.489> misconception<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.479> I'm

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
are out there misconception so I'm

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.789 
are out there misconception so I'm
hoping<00:01:04.750> we<00:01:04.869> can<00:01:04.989> talk<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.199> little<00:01:05.409> bit<00:01:05.590> about

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
hoping we can talk a little bit about

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.490 
hoping we can talk a little bit about
those<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.939> first<00:01:07.240> one<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.570> really<00:01:08.079> this<00:01:08.320> idea

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
those the first one is really this idea

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.130 
those the first one is really this idea
that<00:01:09.420> weightlifting<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.659> gonna<00:01:10.840> make<00:01:10.990> you

really unattractive because you know
you're<00:01:13.240> gonna<00:01:13.300> accidentally<00:01:13.870> walk<00:01:14.110> into<00:01:14.380> a

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
you're gonna accidentally walk into a

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.399 
you're gonna accidentally walk into a
weight<00:01:14.590> room<00:01:14.740> walk<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.580> look<00:01:16.000> like<00:01:16.180> that

weight room walk out and look like that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.800 
weight room walk out and look like that
that's<00:01:17.409> what's<00:01:17.590> gonna<00:01:17.710> happen<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:19.659> in

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
that's what's gonna happen when in

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.570 
that's what's gonna happen when in
reality<00:01:19.960> there's<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.979> lot<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.159> really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
reality there's a lot of really

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.310 
reality there's a lot of really
beautiful<00:01:22.120> women<00:01:22.420> who<00:01:22.540> lift<00:01:22.720> weights<00:01:22.960> to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and this all stems also from this idea

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.170 
and this all stems also from this idea
that<00:01:28.479> muscle<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.799> gonna<00:01:29.979> make<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.190> bulky<00:01:30.580> well

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
you can eat more Donuts there's also

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.200 
you can eat more Donuts there's also
this<00:01:43.869> idea<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:45.010> weightlifting<00:01:45.970> is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
this idea that that weightlifting is

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.750 
this idea that that weightlifting is
dangerous<00:01:46.659> for<00:01:46.690> women<00:01:46.990> right<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:48.340> truth<00:01:48.580> is

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
dangerous for women right the truth is

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.359 
dangerous for women right the truth is
that<00:01:48.790> all<00:01:49.270> sports<00:01:49.960> have<00:01:50.320> some<00:01:50.500> risks<00:01:50.830> I've

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
that all sports have some risks I've

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.870 
that all sports have some risks I've
experienced<00:01:52.060> them<00:01:52.180> but<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.640> trust

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
experienced them but you have to trust

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.120 
experienced them but you have to trust
that<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.720> do<00:01:55.930> get<00:01:56.110> hurt<00:01:56.320> it's<00:01:56.590> not<00:01:57.040> gonna

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
that if you do get hurt it's not gonna

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.310 
that if you do get hurt it's not gonna
be<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.340> bad<00:01:57.610> cuz<00:01:58.090> ultimately<00:01:58.510> women<00:01:59.080> aren't

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
be that bad cuz ultimately women aren't

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.649 
be that bad cuz ultimately women aren't
that<00:01:59.560> breakable<00:02:00.220> also<00:02:01.000> you're<00:02:01.360> more<00:02:01.479> likely

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
that breakable also you're more likely

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.859 
that breakable also you're more likely
to<00:02:01.840> get<00:02:01.930> hurt<00:02:02.049> riding<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.380> bike<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:03.869> lifting

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
to get hurt riding a bike so lifting

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.200 
to get hurt riding a bike so lifting
weights<00:02:05.220> strengthens<00:02:06.220> your<00:02:06.549> body<00:02:06.759> makes<00:02:07.090> it
