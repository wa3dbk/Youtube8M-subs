00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.439 

one<00:00:00.630> other<00:00:00.810> difference<00:00:01.110> i<00:00:01.589> want<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> point<00:00:02.159> out

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:02.449 
one other difference i want to point out

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.230 
one other difference i want to point out
between<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.929> early<00:00:04.500> conrail<00:00:05.430> paint<00:00:05.819> scheme

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
between the early conrail paint scheme

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.129 
between the early conrail paint scheme
in<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.899> quality<00:00:07.410> paint<00:00:07.830> scheme<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.840> if<00:00:09.840> you'll

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
in the quality paint scheme is if you'll

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.580 
in the quality paint scheme is if you'll
notice<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.309> nose<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.690> lead<00:00:13.019> unit

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
notice on the nose of this lead unit

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.590 
notice on the nose of this lead unit
there<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.340> no<00:00:14.580> black<00:00:15.619> top<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.550> nose<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:18.210> in

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
there is no black top on the nose up in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.000 
there is no black top on the nose up in
here<00:00:19.490> I'm<00:00:20.750> guessing<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> quality

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
here I'm guessing that when the quality

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
here I'm guessing that when the quality
scheme<00:00:23.369> came<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.240> painted<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.810> black

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
scheme came out they painted at black

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.029 
scheme came out they painted at black
probably<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.099> any<00:00:26.400> glare<00:00:26.820> or<00:00:27.769> it<00:00:28.769> might

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
probably is in any glare or it might

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.150 
probably is in any glare or it might
have<00:00:29.279> even<00:00:29.429> had<00:00:30.140> tread<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.380> theirs<00:00:31.740> for

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have even had tread on theirs for

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180 
have even had tread on theirs for
washing<00:00:32.880> cleaning<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.630> windshield<00:00:34.140> etc<00:00:34.980> i'm

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
washing cleaning the windshield etc i'm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.110 
washing cleaning the windshield etc i'm
not<00:00:35.820> sure<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.680> lead<00:00:38.010> two<00:00:38.370> units<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
not sure but the lead two units of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.279 
not sure but the lead two units of
course<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.829> first<00:00:42.350> first<00:00:43.350> run<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:45.289> con

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
course are the first first run of con

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.080 
course are the first first run of con
reels<00:00:46.620> order<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.239> had<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> older<00:00:50.090> paint

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
reels order so it had the older paint

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.319 
reels order so it had the older paint
scheme<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.920> i'm<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.219> sure<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.879> number

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
scheme and then i'm not sure what number

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
scheme and then i'm not sure what number
it<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.140> haven't<00:00:55.289> researched<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it was because i haven't researched it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.410 
it was because i haven't researched it
but<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.489> will<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.030> point<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:59.420> difference

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
but i will at some point the difference

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
but i will at some point the difference
when<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> changed<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.309> regular

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
when they changed from the regular

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.600 
when they changed from the regular
conrail<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> con<00:01:03.930> real<00:01:04.199> quality<00:01:04.610> i'm

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
conrail to the con real quality i'm

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.160 
conrail to the con real quality i'm
thinking<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.540> somewhere<00:01:06.930> around<00:01:07.610> 91<00:01:08.610> ish

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
thinking it was somewhere around 91 ish

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.830 
thinking it was somewhere around 91 ish
but<00:01:10.170> i'm<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.320> sure<00:01:10.820> somewhere<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> time

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but i'm not sure somewhere in that time

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.910 
but i'm not sure somewhere in that time
period<00:01:12.900> again<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> research<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
period again I all have to research that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
period again I all have to research that
but<00:01:16.920> anyway<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.850> even<00:01:18.119> number<00:01:18.299> here

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
but anyway I have an even number here

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.830 
but anyway I have an even number here
for<00:01:19.350> units<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> wondering

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
for units and now I'm kind of wondering

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260 
for units and now I'm kind of wondering
should<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> fifth

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
should I get another one to make a fifth

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.310 
should I get another one to make a fifth
but<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.619> good<00:01:26.030> even<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.210> those<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but they are so good even for those of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
but they are so good even for those of
