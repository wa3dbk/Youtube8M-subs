00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
does it just goes right at dirt level so

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.560 
does it just goes right at dirt level so
if<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:45.369> can't<00:01:45.610> get<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:45.759> at<00:01:45.940> dirt<00:01:46.149> level<00:01:46.479> it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
if it can't get in at dirt level it

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.359 
if it can't get in at dirt level it
doesn't<00:01:46.899> try<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.320> go<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.679> anywhere<00:01:48.009> else<00:01:48.100> and

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
doesn't try to go in anywhere else and

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.690 
doesn't try to go in anywhere else and
then<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.390> way<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.539> it's<00:01:49.810> wrapped<00:01:49.990> around<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.359 

so<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.850> as<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.149> plant<00:01:55.420> grows<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:57.009> aluminum

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
so that as the plant grows the aluminum

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.399 
so that as the plant grows the aluminum
foil<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.759> stretches<00:01:58.149> around<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:58.720> you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
foil just stretches around it and you

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.020 
foil just stretches around it and you
know<00:01:59.530> in<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.679> couple<00:01:59.979> weeks<00:02:00.100> once<00:02:00.429> they<00:02:00.610> get<00:02:00.789> big

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
know in a couple weeks once they get big

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.270 
know in a couple weeks once they get big
enough<00:02:01.149> once<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.720> get<00:02:01.929> past<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.920> early

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
enough once you get past this early

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.580 
enough once you get past this early
spring<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.869> don't<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> problem<00:02:05.500> with

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
spring you don't have the problem with

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.469 
spring you don't have the problem with
them<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.729> only<00:02:06.850> does<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.119> when<00:02:07.330> they're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
them and it only does it when they're

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.080 
them and it only does it when they're
younger<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.319> so<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.670> tallest

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
younger like this so this is the tallest

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.120 
younger like this so this is the tallest
one<00:02:10.330> I'll<00:02:11.019> do<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.319> on<00:02:11.380> another<00:02:11.440> shorter<00:02:11.980> one

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
one I'll do it on another shorter one

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.819 
one I'll do it on another shorter one
and<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.959> way<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.140> guys<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.620> both

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
and so that way you guys can see both

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.259 
and so that way you guys can see both
alright<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.079> smaller<00:02:17.350> one

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
alright so here it is on the smaller one

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.180 
alright so here it is on the smaller one
and<00:02:19.269> all<00:02:19.390> we're<00:02:19.510> going<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.590> exactly<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and all we're going to do is exactly the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.560 
and all we're going to do is exactly the
same<00:02:21.340> thing<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.790> since<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.120> one's<00:02:22.269> smaller

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
same thing and since this one's smaller

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.600 
same thing and since this one's smaller
this<00:02:23.079> little<00:02:23.260> bit<00:02:23.350> easier<00:02:23.709> actually<00:02:23.980> easier

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
this little bit easier actually easier

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.930 
this little bit easier actually easier
to<00:02:24.730> do<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.840> we'll<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.410> take<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.940> piece

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
to do it on so we'll just take a piece

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.539 
to do it on so we'll just take a piece
of<00:02:27.970> foil<00:02:28.269> go<00:02:28.600> ahead<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.810> turn<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.019> out<00:02:29.110> here

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
of foil go ahead and turn it out here

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.460 
of foil go ahead and turn it out here
you<00:02:30.549> know<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:32.489> wrap<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.640> around<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:33.910> that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
you know just wrap it around like that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.750 
you know just wrap it around like that
try<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.709> underneath<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.310> soil<00:02:36.459> line<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
try to get underneath the soil line a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.820 
try to get underneath the soil line a
little<00:02:37.030> bit<00:02:37.859> and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.650 

tear<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.670> fit<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> that's<00:02:46.000> detect<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
tear the fit and that's detect it and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.080 
tear the fit and that's detect it and
keep<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.530> safe<00:02:47.710> that<00:02:47.920> way<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.730> come<00:02:48.850> out<00:02:48.970> here

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
keep it safe that way you come out here

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.550 
keep it safe that way you come out here
in<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.210> few<00:02:49.330> weeks<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.660> look<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.380> your

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
in a few weeks and look you all your

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.130 
in a few weeks and look you all your
Squatch<00:02:51.250> won't<00:02:51.520> be<00:02:51.640> dead<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.090> hope<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.050> was

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
Squatch won't be dead I hope it was

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.780 
Squatch won't be dead I hope it was
informative<00:02:53.290> guys<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:54.040> hope<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.550> don't<00:02:54.670> have

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
informative guys I hope you don't have

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.890 
informative guys I hope you don't have
the<00:02:54.850> same<00:02:54.970> problems<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.450> did<00:02:55.600> last<00:02:55.780> year

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the same problems that I did last year

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500 
the same problems that I did last year
with<00:02:56.050> him<00:02:56.170> like<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.350> lost<00:02:56.710> a<00:02:57.010> six<00:02:57.880> squash<00:02:58.150> plants

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
with him like I lost a six squash plants

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.450 
with him like I lost a six squash plants
I<00:02:58.570> think<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:59.130> which<00:03:00.130> was<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.340> about

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
I think it was which was just about

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.670 
I think it was which was just about
Oliver<00:03:00.730> squash<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:01.810> warm<00:03:02.260> so

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
Oliver squash to that to that warm so

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.100 
Oliver squash to that to that warm so
hope<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:03.700> will<00:03:03.820> help<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.990> good

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
hope this will help and I have a good

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.260 
hope this will help and I have a good
night
