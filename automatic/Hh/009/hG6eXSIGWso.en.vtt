basically<00:00:40.719> to<00:00:40.780> make<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:41.050> so<00:00:41.230> basically<00:00:42.190> every

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
basically to make it so basically every

what<00:00:45.430> Lightroom<00:00:45.700> thinks<00:00:45.970> it<00:00:46.060> should<00:00:46.090> be<00:00:46.300> now<00:00:46.600> I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
what Lightroom thinks it should be now I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.960 
what Lightroom thinks it should be now I
turn<00:00:47.079> this<00:00:47.170> off<00:00:47.350> because<00:00:47.620> most<00:00:48.610> of<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:48.790> time

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
turn this off because most of the time

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.210 
turn this off because most of the time
it<00:00:49.239> doesn't<00:00:49.480> get<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.810> where<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:49.960> want<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.890> I<00:00:50.920> set

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
it doesn't get it where I want so I set

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.000 
it doesn't get it where I want so I set
up<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.430> general<00:00:51.760> preset<00:00:52.450> for<00:00:52.870> importing<00:00:53.440> which

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
up a general preset for importing which

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.430 
up a general preset for importing which

will show you guys later on and and
that's<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.829> preset<00:00:57.130> that<00:00:57.190> I<00:00:57.250> use<00:00:57.550> when<00:00:57.970> I

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
that's the preset that I use when I

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.020 
that's the preset that I use when I
import<00:00:58.450> my<00:00:58.480> images<00:00:59.010> alright<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.370> this<00:01:00.520> apply

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
import my images alright so this apply

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.610 
import my images alright so this apply
auto<00:01:01.239> mix<00:01:01.420> thing<00:01:01.660> when<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.989> first<00:01:02.200> convert<00:01:02.530> an

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
auto mix thing when you first convert an

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.479 
auto mix thing when you first convert an
image<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.890> black<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.220> white<00:01:03.309> when<00:01:03.430> you

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
image to a black and white when you

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.359 
image to a black and white when you
first<00:01:04.239> hit<00:01:04.420> V<00:01:04.750> it'll<00:01:05.500> apply<00:01:05.770> an<00:01:05.860> auto<00:01:06.130> mix

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
first hit V it'll apply an auto mix

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.830 
first hit V it'll apply an auto mix
setting<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.850> usually<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.329> gets<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.630> wrong

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
setting and usually it gets that wrong

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.039 
setting and usually it gets that wrong
too<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:08.560> always<00:01:08.920> turn<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.250> off<00:01:09.399> as<00:01:09.549> well<00:01:10.049> do

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
too so I always turn that off as well do

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.929 
too so I always turn that off as well do
you<00:01:11.110> have<00:01:11.259> another<00:01:11.439> option<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.040> make<00:01:12.490> default

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
you have another option to make default

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.270 
you have another option to make default
specific<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.600> camera<00:01:14.020> serial<00:01:14.409> number<00:01:14.680> now

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
specific to camera serial number now

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.430 
specific to camera serial number now
this<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.850> actually<00:01:16.030> pretty<00:01:16.479> useful<00:01:16.960> if<00:01:17.200> you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
this is actually pretty useful if you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.870 
this is actually pretty useful if you
guys<00:01:17.620> shoot<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.010> large<00:01:18.220> studio<00:01:18.549> or<00:01:18.729> if<00:01:18.820> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
guys shoot in a large studio or if you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.520 
guys shoot in a large studio or if you
shoot<00:01:19.090> just<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.540> your<00:01:19.840> studio<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.320> say<00:01:20.470> you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
shoot just in your studio and say you

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.230 
shoot just in your studio and say you
use<00:01:20.740> several<00:01:21.340> different<00:01:21.580> types<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.820> cameras

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
use several different types of cameras

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.660 
use several different types of cameras
well<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.110> can<00:01:23.260> create<00:01:23.500> default<00:01:23.950> settings<00:01:24.430> for

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
well you can create default settings for

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.670 
well you can create default settings for
each<00:01:24.940> different<00:01:25.330> kind<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.570> camera<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.500> let's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
each different kind of camera so let's

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.649 
each different kind of camera so let's
say<00:01:26.830> one<00:01:27.040> camera<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.610> maybe<00:01:28.000> softer<00:01:28.570> than

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
say one camera is maybe softer than

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.930 
say one camera is maybe softer than
another<00:01:28.930> or<00:01:29.290> one<00:01:30.010> camera<00:01:30.310> has<00:01:30.430> more<00:01:30.610> colors

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
another or one camera has more colors

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.730 
another or one camera has more colors
than<00:01:31.090> another<00:01:31.330> or<00:01:31.390> whatever<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.409> guys<00:01:32.590> can

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
than another or whatever you guys can

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.859 
than another or whatever you guys can
create<00:01:33.100> default<00:01:33.369> develop<00:01:33.970> settings<00:01:34.150> for<00:01:34.720> each

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
create default develop settings for each

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.719 
create default develop settings for each
specific<00:01:35.080> camera<00:01:35.560> see<00:01:35.770> remember<00:01:36.010> if<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.520> have

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
specific camera see remember if you have

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.969 
specific camera see remember if you have
this<00:01:36.940> checked<00:01:37.330> same<00:01:38.320> thing<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.680> be<00:01:38.770> able<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
this checked same thing to be able to

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.010 
this checked same thing to be able to
create<00:01:39.159> defaults<00:01:39.820> specific<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.299> camera<00:01:40.600> ISO

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
create defaults specific to camera ISO

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.840 
create defaults specific to camera ISO
settings<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.040> can<00:01:42.130> create<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.610> noise

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
settings so you can create like noise

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.160 
settings so you can create like noise
reduction<00:01:43.119> settings<00:01:43.570> for<00:01:43.720> when<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.900> was<00:01:44.020> shot

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
reduction settings for when it was shot

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.550 
reduction settings for when it was shot
at<00:01:44.200> 400<00:01:44.890> ISO<00:01:45.220> 800<00:01:45.790> ISO<00:01:46.060> 1600<00:01:46.540> ISO<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:47.409> on
