00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
shower and washed it out and that I it's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340

shiny<00:01:46.049> she<00:01:46.560> said<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> pelvic<00:01:47.189> thicker<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.479> maybe

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
shiny she said a pelvic thicker so maybe

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
shiny she said a pelvic thicker so maybe
it's<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.649> difference<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> hair<00:01:50.610> thing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it's just a difference what a hair thing

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
it's just a difference what a hair thing
you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.540> don't<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.869> market

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you know it's they don't really market

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
you know it's they don't really market
it<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.590> natural<00:01:53.490> black<00:01:53.729> hair<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.329> some

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it to natural black hair but for some

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
it to natural black hair but for some
reason<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.049> deeply<00:01:55.350> nourishing<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
reason it's a deeply nourishing and like

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.580 
reason it's a deeply nourishing and like
conditioning<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.060> figured<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.380> work

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
conditioning so I figured it would work

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
conditioning so I figured it would work
and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.610> didn't<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.420> me<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and it didn't really for me but if that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.230 
and it didn't really for me but if that
