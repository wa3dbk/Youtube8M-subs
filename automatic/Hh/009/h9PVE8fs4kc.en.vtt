this being work properly now try that
exact<00:02:05.520> same<00:02:05.729> motion<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.420> letting<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.050> Citgo

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.309 
exact same motion but letting the Citgo
the<00:02:07.800> exact<00:02:08.340> moment<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:09.000> drumstick<00:02:09.990> touches
