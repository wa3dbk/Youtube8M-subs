is what the auction house looks like now
I'm<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.430> surprised<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:28.140> actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I'm actually surprised they can actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
I'm actually surprised they can actually
oh<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.460> looked<00:01:29.610> good<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.850> can

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
oh there we go it looked good I can

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
oh there we go it looked good I can
actually<00:01:30.299> search<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.720> specific<00:01:30.840> player

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
actually search for a specific player

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
actually search for a specific player
now<00:01:31.530> which<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.979> actually<00:01:32.220> better<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
now which is actually better because I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.760 
now which is actually better because I
think<00:01:33.600> their<00:01:33.840> price<00:01:33.990> range<00:01:34.020> should<00:01:34.439> appear<00:01:34.740> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
think their price range should appear in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
think their price range should appear in
the<00:01:35.009> actual<00:01:35.220> box<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the actual box so here we go this is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
the actual box so here we go this is
actual<00:01:37.320> gameplay<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> looks

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
actual gameplay this is what it looks

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060 
actual gameplay this is what it looks
like<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.020> sprint<00:01:40.710> switch

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
like now you can actually sprint switch

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
like now you can actually sprint switch
tackle<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.030> gamepad<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.720> actually

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
tackle and the gamepad you can actually

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
tackle and the gamepad you can actually
move<00:01:43.380> its<00:01:43.649> exact<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> same<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.390> looks

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
move its exact the same for and it looks

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
move its exact the same for and it looks
a<00:01:45.689> bit<00:01:45.720> fresher<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.229> my<00:01:46.350> opinion<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> colors

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
a bit fresher in my opinion the colors

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
a bit fresher in my opinion the colors
are<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.549> easier<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
are actually easier because then you can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090 
are actually easier because then you can
actually<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.590> mind<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> actually

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
actually use your mind to actually

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.499 
actually use your mind to actually
process<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.909> place<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
process what place you're gonna be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.310 
process what place you're gonna be

September<00:02:51.690> which<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:51.990> quite<00:02:52.260> late<00:02:52.680> because

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
September which is quite late because

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.400 
September which is quite late because
considering<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.180> released<00:02:54.480> about<00:02:54.660> 18th

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
considering it was released about 18th

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.190 
considering it was released about 18th
or<00:02:55.530> 19th<00:02:55.560> September<00:02:56.400> last<00:02:56.580> year<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.570> yeah<00:02:57.990> in

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
or 19th September last year but yeah in

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.810 
or 19th September last year but yeah in
my<00:02:58.350> opinion<00:02:58.860> there's<00:02:59.100> not<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.430> much<00:02:59.610> point

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
my opinion there's not really much point

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.860 
my opinion there's not really much point
in<00:02:59.910> me<00:02:59.970> doing<00:03:00.030> anything<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.540> speaking<00:03:00.750> up

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
in me doing anything on speaking up

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.090 
in me doing anything on speaking up
