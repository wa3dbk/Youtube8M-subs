00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:15.200
 In this time, 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:20.600
 It'll be too soon. Let's see how to change the number in the house. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:25.220
 Uh, the number is now 1234. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.009
 Of course, I do not actually do this. 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.110
 It's easy to set up 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.780
 character 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.230
 In the untied state 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.100
 There's a reset button next to it. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:47.710
 2 Press the 3 button in the direction of this arrow 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.710
 Turn to the right then set a new number here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.840
 2 1 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:00.360
 Let's do it again 2 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.360
 Explore the reset button to the original position 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:09.280
 This number has been changed so 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.280
 It's a wild ginseng. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:21.480
 But look at the number lock on YouTube 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:28.400
 I have a video of some of the people in 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.400
 I've tried it once, but it did not work. 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.520
 When they look at 13 programs , 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.520
 It turns like this 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:46.610
 I have a feeling that Toriisa is caught. 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 But the keys on it 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.950
 I do not know if I have more feelings 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.150
 This pierce that I have 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:05.040
 I have mistakenly recalled the second-order Dojo-no- o 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.040
 I do not know if there 's a feeling of being beggars anymore. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.119
 I'll finish the explanation.
