00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.359
 Not long ago, a scientist's announcement 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.359
 Trembling in fear of America 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.240
 The possibility of an explosion of a super volcano dragging from under the ground in Delilaston National Park 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:22.189
 It was raised 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 While 66% of Americans are going to lose their lives, 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:31.109
 I can not predict the exact explosion. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 Oh, the only passage into the earth 5 rice 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.230
 Despite a lot of human efforts, they are not allowing our way 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.270
 Because 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:48.880
 Magma hot, rescue indeyo I still respect the territorial sea and fear 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:54.060
 It only makes elasticity by looking at the horseshoes that come out everywhere. 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.060
 The key to fascination is not to hit 4 Qingdao 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.500
 Humans are partial, but this heat energy is visible. 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.460
 In October, the development of the volcano 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:20.459
 Owner is not very different in the ground three recordings, so directly rather resin Gin 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:25.590
 I think it's possible to generate geothermal power only where we can raise land. 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:27.000
 Now drilling technology to current technology, I ran to the monograph of Engineering and Technology 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.920
 now 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.920
 We can not do geothermal development. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.450
 Open- to-the- eye 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 In fact, this heat is also long in the underground. 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 Every time you go down to 100 liters in the center, your life gets hot. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.710
 This is a pure beast that the earth holds infinitely . 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.710
 Story of hemostasis 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 U 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.400
 Room 76 countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia consisting of one island 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:10.410
 It is the biggest hunting country in the world . 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.590
 Particularly president beautiful in coming because the pizza made of volcanic fluorescent Pearl TV 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.590
 I see 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 Indonesia, located in the Pacific Rim of Korea 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.060
 There are as many as 70 places in the mountains that can not be exploded again . 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:35.580
 Among them , Kawazen Cursor is the world's best customs officer 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.580
 It is the only place where you can stand the sulfur of 99.99% purity 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 He ascended there are more workers in the sulfur elasticity of the car and you forget volcanoes 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.190
 70 90kg lump in the yuan would deal put on both sides of the basket 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:07.609
 Highly acidic yuan singer and does not know when dakchilji always allowed because 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.609
 What does it mean to Indonesian people living in a workplace ? 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.340
 To the poor, natural environment that causes many casualties and gives fear. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.340
 It is an effort to pioneer and write 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.290
 Sulfur agglomerates produced by these hard work 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.680
 Mid-atmosphere of fertilizer and chemical manufacturing with disinfectant 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.870
 Become a valuable raw material for cosmetics 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.940
 The most significant geothermal region in the world is Indonesia. 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.410
 Despite two points of freedom , the US and the Philippines are behind in geothermal energy 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.780
 It is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:01.800
 South East Asia's Largest Economy 9 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.650
 Even in the absence of 250 visible eyes 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.650
 We only explored geothermal times in just seven places. 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.250
 India 4 Experiment Part 1 is the volcano's huge Museum 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.840
 All kinds of volcanoes 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.640
 The full-time and around for when you do not know teojilji 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.280
 The support of the grant 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.280
 It is the most fun we have on earth 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 When the Indian trial is in place , 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.230
 They're piled up. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.100
 Subsea sediments contain a lot of my water. 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:52.260
 It will have a soft font is offering its deposits 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.930
 Then , what role does the water play when it becomes steam, 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.940
 As it did make its energy 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:04.729
 After that, not only that but now it spreads and the melting point of the rock 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:09.440
 It will set the melting point and create a massive magma. 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:13.669
 So, the magma , I 've got molecular motions . 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.590
 It goes up through anything like this that it was that other indicators to watch 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:21.230
 3 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:23.120
 Well that is when looking at the full amount of its geothermal power in Indonesia around the world, US 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.860
 It 's the third after the Philippines . 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.050
 Then look to the potential for geothermal power generation comes as fierce diffusible potential 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.050
 Almost achieving the highest level of the world 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.140
 Churchill spent geothermal field located in Bandung, Indonesia 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.230
 As a geothermal power plant for the Wat Phat I was working on a volcano. 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:53.190
 It is responsible for the power of rebounding and opening up to Bali . 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:57.120
 This is one of the business trips to raise steam in pairs. 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:01.470
 Spray extra preparation to the ground to adjust the pressure. 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.460
 The power plant dimensions also denote raincoats as sums. 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.700
 Like the birds of the clear water 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:13.620
 I think it is a benefit of nature . 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:18.810
 There are 8 3 such semi - 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:21.960
 It is located centrally and has a large kettle for the parasites between the illusions. 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.820
 Heated preparations are spreading as if 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.800
 What makes this possible is that we, too , 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:37.080
 We can not control what Week May He does characters and 2 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.810
 May Erusurf r2 sheet 2 3 4 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.810
 Yeah and den e25 on 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.950
 n10 full attention 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:52.100
 We wrote it in French stem Soeumin 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.100
 When a map is and when and Fishing Day event 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:07:00.230
 All the way to Samojang Power Station, 1.5km below 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.230
 There's a hot public opinion. 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.860
 It is the abundant volcano near the Kamo area development all of you. 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:21.949
 The power output of this one 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.949
 A total of 83 crabs will be multiplied in 45 wells and also 6 mice
