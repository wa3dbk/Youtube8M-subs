Hi!  today we'll make this nice Christmas ornament to hang on your tree

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:08.757
stay with me and subscribe to my channel

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:16.127
for this ornament I'm going to use fantasy framelits

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:17.797
but if you don't have them

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:22.927
you can cut using scissors or other framelits shapes

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:26.586
so choose 2 framelits, one bigger than the other to cut a frame

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:31.817
in my case I have chosen this Christmas paper that I have made in another video

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:36.287

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:40.907
on your screen

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.897
fold the frame in half

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:44.867
and do the same

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:50.087
with 3 more frames

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:52.056
for next step

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.567
I'm going to use a tree stamp and it's framelit

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.247
but you can do this drawing a Christmas tree

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:02.477
and then cutting it with scissors

00:01:02.477 --> 00:01:04.046
ink the stamp

00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:09.417
and stamp on a white cardstock

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:14.827
stamp 2 trees so the ornaments will look good from any side

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:21.827
then cutting the trees

00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:33.497
now, let's decorate these Christmas trees

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:36.767
using some color, so stamp some details on white cardstock

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:41.067
and indelible ink

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:47.917
put some color with watercolor

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:52.597
cut all the decorations to glue them on the trees

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:58.197
in my case I did make 6 candies and 2 stars that I'll glue on each tree

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:02.457
on one side and on the other... glue the decorations on

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:09.457
each tree

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:16.686
now that we have all the pieces

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.836
let's put together the ornament

00:02:18.836 --> 00:02:22.046
start putting some glue on one frame side

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:27.516
and glue on top a half of

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:31.886
another frame

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:38.886
this way glue all the frames but don't close the ornament

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:55.146
after gluing all the frames except the last part

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:56.336
put a nice

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.626
Christmas thread

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:04.046
and glue it on the ends

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.696
also

00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:07.036
glue the trees

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:14.036
on one side of the thread and on the other

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:29.917
make a loop with the thread

00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:35.576
and glue the end on the frame

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:38.896
as soon as the tree is well glued

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:45.896
finish gluing the last frame and your ornament will be ready to hang on your Christmas tree

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:50.026
