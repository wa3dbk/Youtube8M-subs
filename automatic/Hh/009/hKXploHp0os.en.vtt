to<00:00:12.870> start<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> home<00:00:13.440> studio<00:00:13.740> series<00:00:14.400> of

to start the home studio series of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.550 
to start the home studio series of
videos<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.210> figured<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> best<00:00:16.080> place<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> begin

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
videos I figured the best place to begin

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.060 
videos I figured the best place to begin
would<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.699> design<00:00:18.029> idea<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.980> wanted<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
would be the design idea I wanted to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.720 
would be the design idea I wanted to
have<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> control<00:00:20.760> room<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> console<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
have a control room for the console and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
have a control room for the console and
a<00:00:23.730> keyboard<00:00:23.939> workstation<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.990> live<00:00:25.680> room<00:00:25.980> for

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a keyboard workstation a live room for

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.970 
a keyboard workstation a live room for
the<00:00:26.430> performance<00:00:27.000> area<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.320> separate<00:00:28.650> gear

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the performance area and a separate gear

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490 
the performance area and a separate gear
space<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.849> house<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.269> computers<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
space to house the computers so the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
space to house the computers so the
sound<00:00:31.769> would<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.820> intrude<00:00:33.149> into<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> control

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
sound would not intrude into the control

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.310 
sound would not intrude into the control
room<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.380> live<00:00:34.710> room<00:00:34.950> spaces<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.809> also<00:00:36.809> wanted

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
room or live room spaces I also wanted

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to have the glass view into the live

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.560 
to have the glass view into the live
room<00:00:40.010> since<00:00:41.010> building<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> studio<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.940> visited

room since building the studio I visited

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
room since building the studio I visited
several<00:00:42.899> studio<00:00:43.410> spaces<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
several studio spaces that have the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.270 
several studio spaces that have the
console<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> engineer<00:00:46.440> located<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.129> the

same<00:00:47.489> space<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.710> as<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> musicians<00:00:50.160> work

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
same space and as the musicians work

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
same space and as the musicians work
this<00:00:51.059> seems<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.809> fine<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.110> them<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this seems to be just fine for them I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
this seems to be just fine for them I
still<00:00:53.640> prefer<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> separate<00:00:54.449> control<00:00:54.870> room

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
still prefer the separate control room

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.069 
still prefer the separate control room
though<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> isolation<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
though not just for the isolation but I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
though not just for the isolation but I
really<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> vibe<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.129> through<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really like the vibe of through the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.479 
really like the vibe of through the
glass<00:01:00.120> studio<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.410> seems<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.890> professional

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
glass studio it seems more professional

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
glass studio it seems more professional
to<00:01:02.670> me<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> did<00:01:03.809> create<00:01:03.960> some<00:01:04.409> design

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to me but it did create some design

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.219 
to me but it did create some design
issues<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.790> increase<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> difficulty<00:01:07.049> in

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
issues and increase the difficulty in

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
issues and increase the difficulty in
building<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> rooms<00:01:09.140> here's<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> basic

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
building the rooms here's the basic

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.230 
building the rooms here's the basic
shape<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> studio<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.670> envisioned<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
shape of the studio I envisioned I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
shape of the studio I envisioned I
wanted<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.830> live<00:01:16.830> room<00:01:18.140> at<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.409> end<00:01:19.820> for<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
wanted a live room at one end for the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.779 
wanted a live room at one end for the
musicians

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.609 

so<00:01:25.789> this<00:01:26.000> area<00:01:26.270> would<00:01:26.630> be<00:01:26.810> where<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.350> band

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
so this area would be where the band

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.219 
so this area would be where the band
would<00:01:27.799> set<00:01:28.070> up<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.490> wanted<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.479> control<00:01:29.929> room

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
would set up I wanted a control room

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.270 
would set up I wanted a control room
where<00:01:30.859> I<00:01:30.890> could<00:01:31.039> put<00:01:31.219> my<00:01:31.399> console<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:33.280> see

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
where I could put my console and see

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.730 
where I could put my console and see
through<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.610> glass<00:01:34.850> into<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.960> live<00:01:36.409> room

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
through the glass into the live room

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.300

I<00:01:37.750> needed<00:01:38.750> an<00:01:38.869> area<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:40.549> store<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.000> gear<00:01:41.469> so

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
I needed an area to store the gear so

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.190 
I needed an area to store the gear so
the<00:01:42.619> computers<00:01:43.219> would<00:01:44.060> not<00:01:44.299> be<00:01:44.509> making<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:45.020> big

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the computers would not be making a big

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.130 
the computers would not be making a big

fan<00:02:29.389> issues<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.739> didn't<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.069> I'd<00:02:31.220> be

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
fan issues and I didn't think I'd be

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.660 
fan issues and I didn't think I'd be
having<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.880> many<00:02:32.120> live<00:02:32.389> vocals<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.519> as<00:02:34.519> it

I suppose recording a very soft flute

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.110 
I suppose recording a very soft flute
part<00:06:40.720> at<00:06:41.080> just<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.650> moment<00:06:41.860> a<00:06:42.130> semi<00:06:42.520> blasted

by<00:06:43.270> would<00:06:43.540> require<00:06:43.870> a<00:06:43.930> new<00:06:44.170> take<00:06:44.440> but<00:06:45.070> it

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
by would require a new take but it
