00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 if like the artists breakdown you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.750
 enjoy the wisteria flowers you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.820
 consider planting a glycine how 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.820
 the plant and especially where to install it 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 then the place of planting a lot 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 important because it will take him a 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 very strong support it can be 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.390
 why not a grid a grid of which 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 the glycine will be able to push on the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.380
 grid it's even wrong grid 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 she's so beefy it can be 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 along a wall or why not like 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 here on a pergola a pergola that has 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 been securely tied with tubes 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 quite significant because the glycine it does not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.790
 must not forget it's a pretty trunk 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 important and who risk thorn and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.690
 to damage your support another 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.760
 important condition for having a 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 beautiful cuisine is to avoid limestone 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 and especially the excess water here I am in 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 presence of a place where there is no harm 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.010
 humidity a lot of clay we're going 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 transform a little bit this land so 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 there he is already sure to raise his elevated 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.430
 with rafters which she will not have 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.080
 a little less feet in the water 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.189
 but to accentuate precisely the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.380
 drainage what am I going to do 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.150
 I already made a hole a hole that makes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.159
 about 40 cm deep 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 we will add rubble 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 chippings things that you have left to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 condition that these rubble is not 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.619
 limestone now we will fill our 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.560
 hole with a mixture of compost and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.439
 sand count value we have two miss o 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.500
 for a compost wheelbarrow to make up 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:35.909
 which comes from a manure well compost of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:40.020
 last year and we will start to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.030
 install our wisteria then the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.210
 glycine before was soaked 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.649
 in a bucket of water so that the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.799
 mode be shy before the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.799
 planting 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 now we're going to hang it on 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.820
 edge secretly so no it's this 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 a glycine that has been grafted we see the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.570
 graft especially as a fruit tree 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 comes to town which has been grafted onto 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 thou never buried the spelling it takes 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.509
 plant by the same position 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.190
 where it was grown before here 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.030
 is a container for programming 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 exactly the same way 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.400
 it's the potting mix with the handle of your 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.400
 shovel and one pursuits 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.849
 that's so at the time of planting you 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.190
 have buried the transplant on everything that 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.220
 is important is to clear it 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.010
 the graft point have made a small 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:46.620
 bowl cup slightly more 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.569
 to water our wisteria here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.489
 now our wisteria and planted 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.980
 this voluble plant and climbs one goes 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.800
 to be able to use a guardian 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.750
 who is positioned just the name she is going 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.510
 wrap around this guardian for 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 to find an important structure 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.620
 form of palisades
