00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
simple we just follow the path around

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
flashlight now the flashlight does vary

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
flashlight now the flashlight does vary
position<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.149> always<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> same

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
position it's not always in the same

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
position it's not always in the same
place<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> retry<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.189> whatever

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
place if you have to retry for whatever

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000 
place if you have to retry for whatever
reason<00:01:06.229> chances<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
reason chances are when you get back to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.530 
reason chances are when you get back to
the<00:01:08.100> house<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> completely

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the house it will be in a completely

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
the house it will be in a completely
different<00:01:09.689> position<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.830> probably<00:01:11.010> won't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
different position so it probably won't

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
different position so it probably won't
be<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.909> found<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:13.799> will

into the wooded area now I tend to turn
on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.850> generators<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.930> mean<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:49.069> run

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
on the generators I mean you can run

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.309 
on the generators I mean you can run
with<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.640> flashlight<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.780> tend<00:02:51.110> to

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
with just the flashlight but I tend to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.710 
with just the flashlight but I tend to
want<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.010> much<00:02:52.160> likes<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.700> only<00:02:52.819> possible<00:02:53.360> so

want as much likes you only possible so
you'll<00:02:53.870> see<00:02:54.019> me<00:02:54.049> turn<00:02:54.319> on<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.530> generators<00:02:54.739> ago

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
you'll see me turn on the generators ago

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.309 
you'll see me turn on the generators ago
but<00:02:56.299> if<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.510> hit<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.750> first<00:02:56.900> unit<00:02:57.200> rate

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
but if I hit the first unit rate

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.520 
but if I hit the first unit rate
straight<00:02:57.620> across<00:02:57.769> from<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.250> gate<00:02:59.110> and<00:03:00.110> I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
straight across from the gate and I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.770 
straight across from the gate and I
follow<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.739> path<00:03:00.830> down<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.760> left

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780

it<00:03:06.410> is<00:03:06.560> possible<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.010> encounter<00:03:07.340> Slenderman

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
it is possible to encounter Slenderman

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.130 
it is possible to encounter Slenderman
you<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.060> account<00:03:08.360> him<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.660> house<00:03:08.840> at<00:03:09.080> the

there I've seen on top of the hill there

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.190 
there I've seen on top of the hill there
to<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> right<00:03:16.270> but<00:03:17.270> you<00:03:17.600> should<00:03:17.810> really<00:03:18.050> have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
to the right but you should really have

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.720 
to the right but you should really have
too<00:03:18.470> many<00:03:18.530> problems<00:03:18.920> with<00:03:19.069> him<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.610> first

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
too many problems with him in the first

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.010 
too many problems with him in the first
episode<00:03:20.270> first<00:03:20.780> chapter<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:22.340> switch<00:03:22.520> this

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
episode first chapter so we switch this

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.990 
episode first chapter so we switch this
generator<00:03:24.020> on<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.590> now<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.610> can<00:03:25.760> see<00:03:25.880> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
generator on and now you can see the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.160 
generator on and now you can see the
bridge<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.450> need<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.690> cross<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.110> order
