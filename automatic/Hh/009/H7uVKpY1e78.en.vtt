and<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:46.730> really<00:03:47.000> slowed<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.630> down<00:03:47.660> made<00:03:48.139> it<00:03:48.319> a

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and just really slowed it down made it a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740 
and just really slowed it down made it a
little<00:03:48.650> bit<00:03:48.859> darker<00:03:49.459> in<00:03:49.700> area<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.389> gave<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.660> a

as the godmother of punk to appear and

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.770 
as the godmother of punk to appear and
record<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.530> song<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.550> soundtrack<00:05:27.940> but

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.930 
record a song for this soundtrack but
it's<00:05:29.320> not<00:05:29.530> something<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:29.950> I'm<00:05:30.160> totally<00:05:30.430> into

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
it's not something that I'm totally into

it's not something that I'm totally into
someone's<00:05:31.510> but<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.720> definitely<00:05:31.960> still

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
someone's but I definitely still

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.070

respected<00:05:33.220> there's<00:05:33.760> just<00:05:33.940> a<00:05:34.240> few<00:05:34.270> songs<00:05:34.690> that

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
respected there's just a few songs that

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.020 
respected there's just a few songs that
feel<00:05:35.260> a<00:05:35.289> little<00:05:35.380> bit<00:05:35.680> just<00:05:35.919> too<00:05:36.220> slow<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.610> feel

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
feel a little bit just too slow and feel

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.730 
feel a little bit just too slow and feel
like<00:05:37.060> they<00:05:37.330> don't<00:05:37.630> really<00:05:37.840> keep<00:05:38.229> up<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.530> pace

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
like they don't really keep up the pace

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.950 
like they don't really keep up the pace
even<00:05:39.130> though<00:05:39.220> they<00:05:39.370> are<00:05:39.580> telling<00:05:40.210> solid

even though they are telling solid

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.260 
even though they are telling solid
stories<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:42.010> can't<00:05:42.430> get<00:05:42.639> into<00:05:42.940> them<00:05:43.150> and
