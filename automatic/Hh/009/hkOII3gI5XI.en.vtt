hey guys Cooper Carter here again 4G 66
and<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.090> video<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.480> want<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:54.840> address<00:00:55.080> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and in this video I want to address a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.570 
and in this video I want to address a
question<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.650> I've<00:00:55.860> seen<00:00:56.040> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.490> the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
question that I've seen a lot on the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.610 
question that I've seen a lot on the
fractal<00:00:57.000> forum<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.630> is<00:00:57.810> how<00:00:58.080> do<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.200> run<00:00:58.470> an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
fractal forum which is how do I run an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
fractal forum which is how do I run an
acoustic<00:00:59.070> guitar<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> axe-fx<00:01:00.060> and<00:01:00.450> make

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
acoustic guitar into the axe-fx and make

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
acoustic guitar into the axe-fx and make
it<00:01:00.750> sound<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.080> good<00:01:01.350> I've<00:01:02.010> been<00:01:02.070> running

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it sound really good I've been running

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.610 
it sound really good I've been running
this<00:01:02.580> acoustic<00:01:02.880> into<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> axe-fx<00:01:03.810> live<00:01:04.260> for

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
this acoustic into the axe-fx live for

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.680 
this acoustic into the axe-fx live for
years<00:01:04.800> now<00:01:05.070> I've<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.670> used<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.090> direct

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
years now I've even used it direct

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.780 
years now I've even used it direct
through<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:06.990> aspects<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.830> recordings<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
through the aspects on recordings so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.010 
through the aspects on recordings so
that<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> mic<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.660> acoustic

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
that I don't have to mic the acoustic

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
that I don't have to mic the acoustic
guitar<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.160> doing<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> taking<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.060> direct

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
guitar what I'm doing is taking a direct

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
guitar what I'm doing is taking a direct
signal<00:01:12.660> out<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> acoustic<00:01:14.070> pick<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.400> into

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
signal out of the acoustic pick up into

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
signal out of the acoustic pick up into
the<00:01:15.090> aspects<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> by<00:01:16.140> using<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.560> tone<00:01:16.800> match

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the aspects and by using a tone match

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
the aspects and by using a tone match
block<00:01:17.340> some<00:01:17.970> compression<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:19.080> other

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
block some compression and some other

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
block some compression and some other
effects<00:01:19.590> I'm<00:01:19.860> getting<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
effects I'm getting what I think is a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.790 
effects I'm getting what I think is a
really<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.180> nice<00:01:21.479> sound<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.470> let<00:01:22.619> me<00:01:22.680> show

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
really really nice sound so let me show

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800 
really really nice sound so let me show
you<00:01:22.890> how<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> okay<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.270> always<00:01:24.450> we're

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you how we do it okay so as always we're

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
you how we do it okay so as always we're
starting<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> blank<00:01:25.740> grid

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
starting with a blank grid

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
starting with a blank grid
I've<00:01:26.820> run<00:01:27.090> shunts<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:27.750> left<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
I've run shunts from the left to the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170 
I've run shunts from the left to the
right<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.410> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> output<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.970> get

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
right so we have output so we just get

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.890 
right so we have output so we just get
this<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.750> very<00:01:31.050> dry<00:01:31.729> direct<00:01:32.900> acoustic

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
this kind of very dry direct acoustic

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740 
this kind of very dry direct acoustic
pickup<00:01:34.290> sound<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.369> we're<00:01:35.820> trying<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> make<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pickup sound that we're trying to make a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
pickup sound that we're trying to make a
little<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.500> sexier<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.490> let's<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.910> hear

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
little bit sexier so let's just hear

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
little bit sexier so let's just hear
what<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.119> sounds<00:01:39.450> like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520 

obviously<00:01:45.490> very<00:01:45.520> quiet<00:01:45.969> so<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.259> first<00:01:47.409> thing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
obviously very quiet so the first thing

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.410 
obviously very quiet so the first thing
we<00:01:47.590> want<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.799> do<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.070> boost<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.490> level<00:01:48.789> we

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
we want to do is boost that level we

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.060 
we want to do is boost that level we
could<00:01:49.630> do<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:49.899> with<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.289> filter<00:01:50.560> block<00:01:50.829> and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
could do that with a filter block and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.819 
could do that with a filter block and
just<00:01:51.189> use<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> null<00:01:51.579> filter<00:01:51.969> and<00:01:52.210> set<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:53.049> level

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
just use a null filter and set the level

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.980 
just use a null filter and set the level
however<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.250> wanted<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:55.390> I'm<00:01:55.780> actually

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
however we wanted it but I'm actually

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.050 
however we wanted it but I'm actually
going<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.649> use<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.159> block<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:57.759> can<00:01:57.909> also

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
going to use a block that we can also

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.569 
going to use a block that we can also
get<00:01:58.479> some<00:01:58.750> other<00:01:58.899> use<00:01:59.770> out<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.039> which<00:02:00.369> would<00:02:00.520> be

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
get some other use out of which would be

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.090 
get some other use out of which would be
the<00:02:00.670> compression<00:02:01.210> block<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.720> as<00:02:02.679> you<00:02:02.799> can<00:02:02.920> see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
the compression block and as you can see

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700 
the compression block and as you can see
I've<00:02:03.369> boosted<00:02:03.819> this<00:02:03.909> level<00:02:04.270> up<00:02:04.420> around<00:02:04.899> 10<00:02:05.259> so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
I've boosted this level up around 10 so

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.080 
I've boosted this level up around 10 so
that<00:02:05.770> brings<00:02:05.950> our<00:02:06.130> signal<00:02:06.490> up<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.850> I've<00:02:06.939> also

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
that brings our signal up and I've also

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.059 
that brings our signal up and I've also
gone<00:02:07.360> ahead<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.810> set<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> pretty<00:02:08.440> high<00:02:08.560> ratio

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
gone ahead and set a pretty high ratio

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.550 
gone ahead and set a pretty high ratio
here<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:10.420> threshold<00:02:10.690> where<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> want<00:02:11.470> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
here and the threshold where I want it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.110 
here and the threshold where I want it
and<00:02:11.739> then<00:02:12.370> I've<00:02:12.459> gone<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.819> lowered<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and then I've gone and lowered the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.570 
and then I've gone and lowered the
attack<00:02:13.390> all<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> way<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.349> I've<00:02:15.340> set

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
attack all the way down and I've set

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.759 
attack all the way down and I've set
this<00:02:15.730> release<00:02:16.150> pretty<00:02:16.720> high<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.410> we're

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
this release pretty high so that we're

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.280 
this release pretty high so that we're
compressing<00:02:18.549> just<00:02:19.239> about<00:02:19.450> everything<00:02:19.870> if<00:02:20.140> we

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
compressing just about everything if we

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.680 
compressing just about everything if we
keep<00:02:20.530> playing<00:02:20.769> it's<00:02:21.580> gonna<00:02:21.670> take<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> pretty

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
keep playing it's gonna take a pretty

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.300 
keep playing it's gonna take a pretty
big<00:02:22.810> gap<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.290> our<00:02:23.590> playing<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.069> let<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
big gap in our playing to let the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.190 
big gap in our playing to let the
compressor<00:02:24.790> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.420> shut<00:02:25.690> off<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> then

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
compressor kind of shut off and then

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.410 
compressor kind of shut off and then
kick<00:02:26.440> back<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.519> I've<00:02:27.610> also<00:02:27.760> switched<00:02:28.209> this

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
kick back in and I've also switched this

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.789 
kick back in and I've also switched this
from<00:02:28.690> fast<00:02:28.959> RMS<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:30.280> RMS<00:02:31.000> Plus<00:02:31.450> peak<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.650> it's

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
from fast RMS to RMS Plus peak and it's

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.320 
from fast RMS to RMS Plus peak and it's
just<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.099> give<00:02:33.280> us<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.489> little<00:02:33.760> more<00:02:34.090> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
just going to give us a little more of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.470 
just going to give us a little more of
an<00:02:34.750> accurate<00:02:35.310> compression<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:36.579> also<00:02:36.849> one

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
an accurate compression but also one

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.539 
an accurate compression but also one
that<00:02:37.510> takes<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.440> bit<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:39.010> an<00:02:39.099> average

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
that takes a bit more of an average

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.809 
that takes a bit more of an average
across<00:02:40.060> time<00:02:40.690> or<00:02:41.230> over<00:02:41.560> time<00:02:41.739> rather<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.640> we

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
across time or over time rather so we

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.070 
across time or over time rather so we
have<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.209> sound

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.710 

so<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> louder<00:02:51.430> signal<00:02:51.910> but<00:02:52.120> also<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.390> signal

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
so a louder signal but also a signal

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.420 
so a louder signal but also a signal
that's<00:02:52.810> getting<00:02:53.110> slightly<00:02:53.410> compressed<00:02:53.800> so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
that's getting slightly compressed so

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.710 
that's getting slightly compressed so
the<00:02:54.520> point<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.820> video<00:02:54.970> though<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.510> how

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the point of this video though is how

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.870 
the point of this video though is how
can<00:02:55.960> we<00:02:55.990> beef<00:02:56.350> up<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.860> sound<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.430> direct

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
can we beef up the sound of a direct

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.510 
can we beef up the sound of a direct
acoustic<00:02:58.870> pickup<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.710> we<00:02:59.860> would<00:03:00.010> use<00:03:00.220> for

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
acoustic pickup that we would use for

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.070 
acoustic pickup that we would use for
example<00:03:00.850> on<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> loud<00:03:01.240> stage<00:03:01.600> where<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:01.930> don't

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
example on a loud stage where we don't

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.720 
example on a loud stage where we don't
have<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.440> opportunity<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:03.130> use<00:03:03.250> an<00:03:03.370> acoustic

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
have the opportunity to use an acoustic

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.760 
have the opportunity to use an acoustic
mic<00:03:03.940> well<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.990> best<00:03:05.140> way<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.290> do<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.650> my

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
mic well the best way to do it in my

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.800 
mic well the best way to do it in my
mind<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.220> by<00:03:06.400> using<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.760> tone<00:03:06.940> match<00:03:07.150> block<00:03:07.450> we

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
mind is by using the tone match block we

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.840 
mind is by using the tone match block we
can<00:03:07.930> go<00:03:08.140> ahead<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.500> add<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.830> in<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:09.700> we're

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
can go ahead and add that in now we're

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.940 
can go ahead and add that in now we're
going<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> actually<00:03:10.180> tone<00:03:10.600> match<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.230> mic

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
going to actually tone match a mic

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.910 
going to actually tone match a mic
guitar<00:03:12.550> tone<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.840> let's<00:03:14.260> take<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> listen<00:03:14.770> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
guitar tone so let's take a listen to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.220 
guitar tone so let's take a listen to
what<00:03:15.490> I've<00:03:15.790> got<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.300> I'm<00:03:16.750> gonna<00:03:16.840> start<00:03:17.140> it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
what I've got and I'm gonna start it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.290 
what I've got and I'm gonna start it
playing<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.740> then<00:03:18.010> capture<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.790> reference

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
playing and then capture this reference

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.150 
playing and then capture this reference
tone<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.870> want<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.380> reference<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:20.890> coming

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
tone I want the reference to be coming

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.460 
tone I want the reference to be coming
in<00:03:21.250> over<00:03:21.490> USB<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.660> very<00:03:22.900> important<00:03:23.320> if

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
in over USB that's very important if

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.660 
in over USB that's very important if
you're<00:03:23.590> playing<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.010> audio<00:03:24.280> through<00:03:24.640> your

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
you're playing the audio through your

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.540 
you're playing the audio through your
DAW<00:03:25.000> or<00:03:25.330> on<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:26.140> internet<00:03:26.530> or<00:03:26.800> through<00:03:27.010> iTunes

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
DAW or on the internet or through iTunes

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.850 
DAW or on the internet or through iTunes
or<00:03:27.700> something<00:03:27.940> similar<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.530> let's

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
or something similar like that so let's

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.160 
or something similar like that so let's
start<00:03:30.130> up<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> reference<00:03:30.760> source<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.450> this

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
start up this reference source and this

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.170 
start up this reference source and this
is<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.320> mic<00:03:32.950> recording<00:03:33.520> of<00:03:33.610> actually<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.000> same

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
is a mic recording of actually the same

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:47.370 
is a mic recording of actually the same
guitar<00:03:34.330> I'm<00:03:34.570> flying

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.040 

okay<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.280> I've<00:03:48.670> ended<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.300> capture<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
okay so I've ended the capture of the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.050 
okay so I've ended the capture of the
reference<00:03:50.380> tone<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.920> now<00:03:51.730> I'm<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.000> go

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
reference tone and now I'm going to go

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.300 
reference tone and now I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.360> capture<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.780> local<00:03:53.170> tone<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.160> I'm

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
ahead and capture the local tone so I'm

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
ahead and capture the local tone so I'm
gonna<00:03:54.490> start<00:03:54.760> playing<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.510> turn<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.930> on

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.869 

okay<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.920> I've<00:04:05.010> got<00:04:05.040> in<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.280> local<00:04:05.550> tone<00:04:05.700> now

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
okay so I've got in the local tone now

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.850 
okay so I've got in the local tone now
I'm<00:04:05.940> gonna<00:04:06.090> hit<00:04:06.209> match<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.440> resulting

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
I'm gonna hit match and the resulting

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.290 
I'm gonna hit match and the resulting
curve<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.280> we've<00:04:08.400> got<00:04:08.640> here<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.150> see

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
curve that we've got here you can see

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.490 
curve that we've got here you can see
it's<00:04:09.510> gonna<00:04:09.599> sound<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.019> little<00:04:10.080> something<00:04:10.290> like

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it's gonna sound a little something like

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's gonna sound a little something like
this

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.260 

so<00:04:23.390> much<00:04:23.780> fuller<00:04:24.140> much<00:04:24.530> nicer<00:04:24.950> sound<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:26.000> what

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
so much fuller much nicer sound so what

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.550 
so much fuller much nicer sound so what
I<00:04:26.300> want<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.900> actually<00:04:27.080> go<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
I want to do is actually go in and

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.620 
I want to do is actually go in and
adjust<00:04:28.010> this<00:04:28.130> gate<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:28.730> we're<00:04:29.420> just<00:04:29.450> gonna

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
adjust this gate so we're just gonna

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.290 
adjust this gate so we're just gonna
turn<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.590> ratio<00:04:30.860> up<00:04:30.980> here<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:31.820> when<00:04:32.060> we're<00:04:32.180> not

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
turn the ratio up here so when we're not

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.970 
turn the ratio up here so when we're not
playing<00:04:34.420> that<00:04:35.420> hiss<00:04:35.600> is<00:04:35.750> gonna<00:04:35.900> shut<00:04:36.080> off<00:04:36.140> so

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
playing that hiss is gonna shut off so

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.260 
playing that hiss is gonna shut off so
now<00:04:37.100> let's<00:04:37.280> go<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.640> start<00:04:37.820> beefing<00:04:38.150> this

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
now let's go in and start beefing this

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.090 
now let's go in and start beefing this
tone<00:04:38.480> up<00:04:38.630> just<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.900> little<00:04:38.930> bit<00:04:39.110> more<00:04:39.350> what<00:04:40.010> I'm

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
tone up just a little bit more what I'm

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.860 
tone up just a little bit more what I'm
gonna<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.520> use<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.820> really<00:04:41.000> really<00:04:41.540> slight

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
gonna do is use a really really slight

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.560 
gonna do is use a really really slight
amount<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.440> chorus<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.550> I'm<00:04:43.790> gonna<00:04:43.880> go<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.270> here

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
amount of chorus so I'm gonna go in here

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.520 
amount of chorus so I'm gonna go in here
and<00:04:44.690> obviously<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.190> too<00:04:46.310> much<00:04:50.530> that's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
and obviously this is too much that's

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.770 
and obviously this is too much that's
more<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.920> an<00:04:52.010> effect<00:04:52.400> for<00:04:52.880> effects<00:04:53.210> sake<00:04:53.450> than

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
more of an effect for effects sake than

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.480 
more of an effect for effects sake than
something<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.320> thickens<00:04:54.680> up<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.890> sound<00:04:55.130> I'm

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
something that thickens up the sound I'm

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.560 
something that thickens up the sound I'm
actually<00:04:55.610> going<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:55.910> change<00:04:55.970> this<00:04:56.270> from<00:04:56.420> the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
actually going to change this from the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.950 
actually going to change this from the
digital<00:04:56.960> mono<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.430> dimension<00:04:59.180> one<00:04:59.600> types

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
digital mono to this dimension one types

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.650 
digital mono to this dimension one types
the<00:05:00.170> other<00:05:00.850> yeah<00:05:01.850> now<00:05:02.180> I'm<00:05:02.270> gonna<00:05:02.360> take<00:05:02.540> the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
the other yeah now I'm gonna take the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.890 
the other yeah now I'm gonna take the
mix<00:05:02.900> down

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
mix down

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.660 
mix down
great<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:05.980> other<00:05:06.100> thing<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.310> can<00:05:06.460> do<00:05:06.550> to

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
great so the other thing I can do to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.300 
great so the other thing I can do to
thicken<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.030> up<00:05:07.180> is<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.390> add<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.990> delay<00:05:08.350> here<00:05:08.740> and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
thicken it up is to add a delay here and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.980 
thicken it up is to add a delay here and
on<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.580> delay<00:05:09.850> what<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.060> want<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.390> do<00:05:10.570> is<00:05:10.780> just

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
on this delay what I want to do is just

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.050 
on this delay what I want to do is just
set<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.290> time<00:05:11.530> really<00:05:11.920> low<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.340> about<00:05:12.460> 75

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
set the time really low so about 75

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.960 
set the time really low so about 75
milliseconds<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.010> mix<00:05:15.220> really<00:05:15.370> low<00:05:15.700> as

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
milliseconds and the mix really low as

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.830 
milliseconds and the mix really low as
well<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.050> what<00:05:17.710> that's<00:05:17.860> gonna<00:05:18.040> do<00:05:18.460> is<00:05:18.790> give<00:05:19.630> me

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
well and what that's gonna do is give me

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.950 
well and what that's gonna do is give me
something<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:21.180> slapback<00:05:22.180> echo<00:05:22.420> so<00:05:22.780> if<00:05:22.870> we

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
something of a slapback echo so if we

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.360 
something of a slapback echo so if we
turn<00:05:23.110> off<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.350> chorus<00:05:23.710> let's<00:05:23.920> just<00:05:24.100> listen<00:05:24.250> to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
turn off the chorus let's just listen to

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.650 
turn off the chorus let's just listen to
the<00:05:24.520> delay

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.140 

so<00:05:30.620> here<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.890> is<00:05:31.040> without<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.580> delay

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.550 

and<00:05:35.150> here<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.750> with<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.140> delay<00:05:36.380> it's

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
and here it is with the delay it's

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.790 
and here it is with the delay it's
specially<00:05:36.890> thicken<00:05:37.250> things<00:05:37.400> up<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.640> little<00:05:37.730> bit

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
specially thicken things up a little bit

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.990 
specially thicken things up a little bit
let<00:05:39.800> me<00:05:39.890> actually<00:05:40.040> bring<00:05:40.340> this<00:05:40.460> mix<00:05:40.730> a<00:05:40.820> little

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
let me actually bring this mix a little

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.620 
let me actually bring this mix a little
bit

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.850 

so<00:05:48.630> it's<00:05:48.750> almost<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.050> reverb<00:05:49.410> so<00:05:49.620> let's<00:05:49.770> turn

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
so it's almost a reverb so let's turn

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.340 
so it's almost a reverb so let's turn
that<00:05:50.040> chorus<00:05:50.400> back<00:05:50.580> on<00:05:50.820> and<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.930> last<00:05:52.110> thing<00:05:52.260> I

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
that chorus back on and the last thing I

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.960 
that chorus back on and the last thing I
haven't<00:05:52.470> want<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.800> do<00:05:52.920> is<00:05:53.130> make<00:05:53.550> some<00:05:53.700> reverb

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
haven't want to do is make some reverb

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.090 
haven't want to do is make some reverb
so<00:05:54.780> I'm<00:05:54.930> going<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.200> put<00:05:55.410> in<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.560> reverb<00:05:55.860> block

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
so I'm going to put in the reverb block

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.620 
so I'm going to put in the reverb block
here<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.490> I<00:05:56.760> want<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:56.970> make<00:05:57.120> sure<00:05:57.150> that<00:05:57.480> we're

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
here and I want to make sure that we're

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.200 
here and I want to make sure that we're
on<00:05:57.660> this<00:05:57.960> new<00:05:58.350> high<00:05:58.650> quality<00:05:58.680> setting<00:05:59.550> which

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
on this new high quality setting which

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.410 
on this new high quality setting which
is<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.200> latest<00:06:01.500> couple<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:01.920> firmwares

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
is in the latest couple of firmwares

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.300 
is in the latest couple of firmwares
what<00:06:03.420> I'm<00:06:03.510> going<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.660> do<00:06:03.780> is<00:06:03.930> use<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.440> large

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
what I'm going to do is use the large

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.050 
what I'm going to do is use the large
hall<00:06:05.700> and<00:06:07.100> take<00:06:08.100> this<00:06:08.220> time<00:06:08.460> up<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.700> little<00:06:08.880> bit

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
hall and take this time up a little bit

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.160 
hall and take this time up a little bit
but<00:06:09.900> take<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.260> mix<00:06:11.240> down<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.690> bit<00:06:12.870> from<00:06:13.020> where

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
but take the mix down a bit from where

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.850 
but take the mix down a bit from where
it<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:13.320> let's<00:06:13.590> see<00:06:13.740> how<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:13.920> sounds<00:06:15.860> yeah

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
it is let's see how that sounds yeah

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.220 
it is let's see how that sounds yeah
that's<00:06:17.100> a<00:06:17.220> lot<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:17.640> reverb<00:06:17.940> so<00:06:18.420> I'm<00:06:19.110> gonna

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
that's a lot of reverb so I'm gonna

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.810 
that's a lot of reverb so I'm gonna
actually<00:06:19.350> take<00:06:19.620> this<00:06:19.770> time<00:06:20.070> down<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.700> I

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
actually take this time down and I

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.130 
actually take this time down and I
actually<00:06:21.060> I'm<00:06:21.300> gonna<00:06:21.390> bring<00:06:21.540> this<00:06:21.660> mix<00:06:21.900> up<00:06:22.050> a

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
actually I'm gonna bring this mix up a

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:35.279 
actually I'm gonna bring this mix up a
good<00:06:22.320> bit

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.899 

much<00:06:36.289> more<00:06:36.530> alive<00:06:36.860> so<00:06:37.280> I<00:06:37.310> hope<00:06:37.490> that<00:06:37.669> gives<00:06:37.789> you

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
much more alive so I hope that gives you

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.270 
much more alive so I hope that gives you
guys<00:06:38.180> an<00:06:38.360> idea<00:06:38.479> of<00:06:38.930> how<00:06:39.319> we<00:06:39.379> can<00:06:39.680> thicken<00:06:39.949> up<00:06:40.159> a

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
guys an idea of how we can thicken up a

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.820 
guys an idea of how we can thicken up a
direct<00:06:40.729> on<00:06:40.999> miked<00:06:41.300> acoustic<00:06:41.780> tone<00:06:41.960> using<00:06:42.620> a

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
direct on miked acoustic tone using a

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.739 
direct on miked acoustic tone using a
tone<00:06:43.009> match<00:06:43.249> recording<00:06:43.729> of<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:43.969> miked<00:06:44.210> acoustic
