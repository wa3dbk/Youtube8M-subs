not good for your veins yeah and because

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.140 
not good for your veins yeah and because
of<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.800> pressure<00:05:14.070> on<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.400> flat<00:05:14.610> very<00:05:14.820> hard

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
of the pressure on the flat very hard

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.140 
of the pressure on the flat very hard
you<00:05:15.810> know<00:05:15.960> that<00:05:16.169> if<00:05:16.410> it's<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:17.150> forty-eight

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
you know that if it's a forty-eight

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.080 
you know that if it's a forty-eight
thousand<00:05:18.600> feet<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:19.490> attitude<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.729> cabin

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
thousand feet the attitude the cabin

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.870 
thousand feet the attitude the cabin
pressure<00:05:21.450> is<00:05:21.690> approximately<00:05:22.530> 6000<00:05:23.490> feet<00:05:23.640> so

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
pressure is approximately 6000 feet so

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.480 
pressure is approximately 6000 feet so
that<00:05:23.910> means<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.720> higher<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.140> is<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.530> more

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
that means the higher it is the more

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.610 
that means the higher it is the more
tire<00:05:26.940> to<00:05:27.180> film<00:05:27.330> on<00:05:27.419> will<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:27.750> people<00:05:28.200> step<00:05:28.590> on
