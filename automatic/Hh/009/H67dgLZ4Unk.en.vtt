00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello to all and good day to everything at their 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.930
 little video to show you how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:20.010
 remove dust in an iphone 3g 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:22.580
 3gs so first rumba remove from 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.580
 screw here 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 after we lift the screen we remove the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 connection pads number 2 3 and the a1 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.530
 here and now we keep the screen 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.120
 then to do that we will 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.050
 remove the screws that are around the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.050
 screen frame 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.020
 hop 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.130
 then he stays a little life 100 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.130
 euros 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.129
 then once it's done m 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.790
 right connecting plies to avoid 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.790
 to damage them 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.390
 then either with a knife or other 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.079
 try to take off the parties that are 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.459
 on the side 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:42.459
 so then there there 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.990
 a cutter 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.380
 so there for the pass between the two and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.760
 once it's past 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.060
 we do a little the lever here is the same 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.060
 the other side 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.980
 once it's done we touch 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:25.080
 the screen a bit up like this 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.080
 is now we draw it here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.540
 so you have separate the screen from the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:38.099
 touch screen chassis so you 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.099
 now take a brush and then go 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:43.420
 so you take a brush now 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.329
 then you take screen and you go 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.480
 you pass the brush on the screen as 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.480
 this to remove all the cp 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.980
 really just the tip of the brush for 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.700
 not damage the screen and then 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.299
 the same on the textile attention number 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.299
 of connections 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:24.970
 then once this is done the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:28.030
 brush and you put the screen back so 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.340
 first of all whose one clip is like that and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.560
 in bone here it is necessary that the small terminal and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 enter between the two so other 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.460
 metal pieces and the frame in 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.570
 plastic 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.710
 once it's good you're 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:47.050
 you to support and therefore see rather 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.820
 click or check who has not 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:05:00.460
 too much dust in the screen me it's 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:06.729
 good so then you take the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.270
 screwdriver plus the little screws and you 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.639
 can start to go up so first 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:17.770
 we put that back who had water that 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.500
 held screen to the chassis and then you can 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:29.120
 omit all the screws that were 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:31.970
 around the chassis like this 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:38.229
 you take the screw you put it at 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.229
 same place I'm going to get there 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.770
 here you screw 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.710
 once everything is well delivered 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.889
 that there is not too much dust in 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.159
 the screen is not possible at all 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:47.620
 you can take the base of 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:58.020
 the iphone then first give the number 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:58.020
 3 which slips of course 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.169
 the tablecloth number 2 that snaps and the 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:12.590
 number one tablecloth that snaps once 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.970
 that it's done you put back the screen on 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.790
 turn on to check that it works 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.199
 so there it works well I had 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:23.660
 not been a pure operation it's not the 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:26.410
 trouble is seen surrendering the two small 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.410
 bottom screw 

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.830
 and now you have your 

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:44.839
 iphone with a lot less dust 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.189
 dance that is much more enjoyable 

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:52.989
 to have 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:52.989
 I will show you my camera 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:04.050
 we see that there is not much we are 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.640
 even nothing at all I have to bomb at a 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.940
 thank you for watching this video and for 

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.940
 the next
