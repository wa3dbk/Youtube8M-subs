what<00:00:26.400> those<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> spas<00:00:28.470> laying<00:00:28.890> down

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
what those are when the spas laying down

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.819 
what those are when the spas laying down
there's<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> bull's-eye<00:00:32.279> sticker<00:00:32.730> right<00:00:32.910> here

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
there's a bull's-eye sticker right here

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.479 
there's a bull's-eye sticker right here
you'll<00:00:34.829> drill<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.809> fish<00:00:37.110> your

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
you'll drill that out and then fish your

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
you'll drill that out and then fish your

sticker for some reason got washed off

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.290 
sticker for some reason got washed off
for<00:01:00.780> taking<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:01.469> there's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.670> dimple

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
for taking off there's a little dimple

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
for taking off there's a little dimple
you'll<00:01:03.719> feel<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.110> dimple<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.559> there

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you'll feel a little dimple right there

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
you'll feel a little dimple right there
that<00:01:05.489> tells<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> where<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.750> channel

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
that tells you where this this channel

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.810 
that tells you where this this channel
is<00:01:08.119> if<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.650> one-inch<00:01:10.650> condo<00:01:11.250> you'll

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is if it's a one-inch condo you'll

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
is if it's a one-inch condo you'll
probably<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> inch<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
probably use like a inch and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
probably use like a inch and
three-eighths<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
three-eighths bit if it's a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
three-eighths bit if it's a
three-quarter<00:01:16.439> inch<00:01:16.619> condom<00:01:17.159> you'll<00:01:17.759> use<00:01:18.000> an

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
three-quarter inch condom you'll use an

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.219 
three-quarter inch condom you'll use an
inch<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.750> eight-bed<00:01:19.580> nice<00:01:20.580> tight<00:01:21.229> fit

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
inch and an eight-bed nice tight fit

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.399 
inch and an eight-bed nice tight fit
right<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.700> when<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.570> drill<00:01:24.960> through<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
right here so when you drill through the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
right here so when you drill through the
first<00:01:25.680> layer<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.659> get<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> call<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> I've

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
first layer I get the call and I've

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
first layer I get the call and I've
drilled<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> hole<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.900> first<00:01:30.930> hole<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
drilled the hole the first hole but I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
drilled the hole the first hole but I
hit<00:01:32.070> something<00:01:32.670> don't<00:01:33.570> worry<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
hit something don't worry about it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.960 
hit something don't worry about it
there's<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> second<00:01:35.040> layer<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.729> so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
there's a second layer back here so

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
there's a second layer back here so
drill<00:01:36.780> through<00:01:36.990> both<00:01:37.229> layers<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.979> you're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
drill through both layers down you're

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.950 
drill through both layers down you're
not<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> hit

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
not going to hit

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.390 
not going to hit
pipes<00:01:39.110> or<00:01:39.320> anything<00:01:39.500> don't<00:01:39.799> worry<00:01:40.010> about<00:01:40.100> it

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
pipes or anything don't worry about it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.120 
pipes or anything don't worry about it
so<00:01:41.060> once<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.450> draw<00:01:41.690> out<00:01:41.720> both<00:01:42.080> holes<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.860> fish

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so once you draw out both holes you fish

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.340 
so once you draw out both holes you fish
this<00:01:43.430> through<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:44.960> will<00:01:45.140> just

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
this through and then this will just

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.380 
this through and then this will just
kind<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.590> snake<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.549> into<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.119> equipment

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
kind of snake up into the equipment

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.630 
kind of snake up into the equipment
compartment<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.920> then<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.190> can<00:01:49.369> new<00:01:49.460> your

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
compartment and then you can new your

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.680 
compartment and then you can new your
connection<00:01:50.090> from<00:01:50.270> there<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.479> want<00:01:53.630> to

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
connection from there and then I want to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.080 
connection from there and then I want to
bring<00:01:53.900> this<00:01:54.049> up<00:01:54.259> into<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.680> camera<00:01:54.920> here<00:01:55.280> this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
bring this up into the camera here this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.719 
bring this up into the camera here this
is<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.300> schematic<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:59.680> wiring<00:02:00.680> on<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.159> bus

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
is a schematic of the wiring on the bus

is a schematic of the wiring on the bus
the<00:02:02.030> terminal<00:02:02.479> bar<00:02:02.659> there<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.740> know<00:02:03.830> here's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the terminal bar there you know here's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.310 
the terminal bar there you know here's
your<00:02:04.250> three<00:02:04.460> wires<00:02:04.670> coming<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.300> here<00:02:05.600> take

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
your three wires coming in here take

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320 
your three wires coming in here take
take<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.680> peek<00:02:07.070> at<00:02:07.280> this<00:02:07.490> knot<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.090> is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
take a peek at this knot this is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.530 
take a peek at this knot this is
extremely<00:02:09.170> important<00:02:09.709> here<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.819> not<00:02:11.030> assume

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
extremely important here do not assume

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.620 
extremely important here do not assume
that<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.989> goes<00:02:12.140> 1<00:02:12.560> 2<00:02:12.860> 3<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.030> ground<00:02:14.269> over

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
that it goes 1 2 3 in the ground over

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.180 
that it goes 1 2 3 in the ground over
here<00:02:14.800> if<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.010> notice<00:02:16.220> here<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.239> blank<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
here if you notice here one is blank and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.949 
here if you notice here one is blank and
I<00:02:19.310> think<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.060> some<00:02:20.330> kind<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.720> European

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
I think it's for some kind of European

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.580 
I think it's for some kind of European
wiring<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.130> one<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.300> blank<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.290> pay<00:02:24.560> very

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
wiring but one is blank so pay very

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.150 
wiring but one is blank so pay very
close<00:02:25.190> attention<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.120> our<00:02:27.019> wires<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
close attention to that our wires in the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
close attention to that our wires in the
states<00:02:28.580> here<00:02:28.850> get<00:02:29.030> hooked<00:02:29.209> up<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.510> number<00:02:29.780> 2<00:02:29.989> 3

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
states here get hooked up to number 2 3

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.070 
states here get hooked up to number 2 3
&amp;<00:02:30.560> 4<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.700> color<00:02:31.940> schemes<00:02:32.360> are<00:02:32.570> over<00:02:32.810> here

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
&amp; 4 and the color schemes are over here

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.979 
&amp; 4 and the color schemes are over here
so<00:02:33.580> spend<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> time<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.360> take<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> look<00:02:35.840> at

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
so spend the time and take a look at

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.650 
so spend the time and take a look at
that<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.580> hook<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.209> number<00:02:38.330> 1

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
that if if you hook it up to number 1

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.470 
that if if you hook it up to number 1
you're<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.019> fry<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.319> motherboard<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you're going to fry the motherboard and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800 
you're going to fry the motherboard and
we<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.840> that's<00:02:42.080> very<00:02:42.560> expensive<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.630> do<00:02:44.630> not

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
we know that's very expensive so do not

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.350 
we know that's very expensive so do not
do<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.470> anyway<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.459> hope<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.030> helped

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that are moulded that you can fish the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.080 
that are moulded that you can fish the
electric<00:02:54.950> throat<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.790> know<00:02:55.880> there's<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
electric throat you know there's a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 
electric throat you know there's a
bull's-eye<00:02:56.450> stick<00:02:56.750> or<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> pair<00:02:57.320> bull's-eye

bull's-eye stick or a pair bull's-eye

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.210 
bull's-eye stick or a pair bull's-eye
stick<00:02:58.579> underneath<00:02:58.940> here<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.010> anyway<00:03:01.010> hope
