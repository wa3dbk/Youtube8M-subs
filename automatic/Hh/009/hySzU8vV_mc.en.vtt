welcome to the exploratorium it's time
for<00:00:03.659> another<00:00:03.750> episode<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.410> iron<00:00:04.920> science

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
for another episode of iron science

it is wieners it's chocolate grab your
fruitcake<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.119> start<00:00:27.510> doing<00:00:27.810> science<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
fruitcake and start doing science and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
fruitcake and start doing science and
math<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.189> go<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.640> contestants

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
math so there they go our contestants

make did you hear it speed up and there
we<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.380> roadkill<00:01:35.340> fruitcake<00:01:36.140> Donna<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
we have roadkill fruitcake Donna so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
we have roadkill fruitcake Donna so
watch<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.150> behavior<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.020> compared<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
watch the behavior of this compared to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
watch the behavior of this compared to
the<00:01:40.890> other<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.700> two<00:01:42.180> three<00:01:42.780> oh<00:01:43.049> yeah<00:01:44.869> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the other one one two three oh yeah it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
the other one one two three oh yeah it
turns<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.460> only<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.850> stuff<00:01:48.060> be

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
turns out the not only can this stuff be

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.289 
turns out the not only can this stuff be
used<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:49.110> rocket<00:01:49.950> fuel<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.670> fruitcake<00:01:51.090> has

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
used as a rocket fuel but fruitcake has

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.160 
used as a rocket fuel but fruitcake has
about<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.689> energy<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.259> dynamite<00:01:53.420> kids<00:01:54.420> do

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
about as much energy as dynamite kids do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
about as much energy as dynamite kids do
not<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:55.950> experiment<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:57.180> home<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.930> can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
not do this experiment at home you can

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
not do this experiment at home you can
eat<00:01:58.170> these<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> want<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.130> think

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
