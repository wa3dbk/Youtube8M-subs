leave the information on here so we

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
leave the information on here so we
could<00:00:17.220> look<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> review

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
could look at it as we start the review

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.260 
could look at it as we start the review
on<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.619> side<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.189> gives<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> basic

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
rundown the bottle splits apart so it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
rundown the bottle splits apart so it
can<00:00:22.920> double<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.369> two<00:00:23.970> cups<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.449> bottom

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
can double as two cups this bottom

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
can double as two cups this bottom

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.960 
I want to run on this item from Stanley
first<00:01:10.329> is<00:01:10.720> with<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.619> tighten<00:01:12.549> down<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
first is with this tighten down on the

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.929 
first is with this tighten down on the
top<00:01:13.180> does<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.540> actually<00:01:13.659> leak<00:01:13.960> any<00:01:14.170> water

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
top does it actually leak any water

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.020 
top does it actually leak any water
which<00:01:15.939> it<00:01:16.210> does<00:01:16.420> not<00:01:16.710> seems<00:01:17.710> like<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.070> pretty

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
which it does not seems like it's pretty

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.450 
which it does not seems like it's pretty
secure<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.229> second<00:01:20.680> question<00:01:20.979> I<00:01:21.070> had<00:01:21.250> was

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
secure the second question I had was

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.830 
secure the second question I had was
actually<00:01:21.579> about<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.090> seal<00:01:22.420> there<00:01:22.689> is<00:01:22.810> a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
actually about this seal there is a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.109 
actually about this seal there is a
gasket<00:01:23.350> that's<00:01:23.830> you<00:01:24.729> know<00:01:24.820> will<00:01:24.939> basically

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
gasket that's you know will basically

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.630 
gasket that's you know will basically
keep<00:01:25.509> these<00:01:25.750> two<00:01:25.990> things<00:01:26.020> sealed<00:01:26.530> together<00:01:27.039> so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
keep these two things sealed together so

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.889 
keep these two things sealed together so
I<00:01:27.670> was<00:01:27.700> concerned<00:01:28.000> if<00:01:28.299> this<00:01:28.420> was<00:01:28.570> say<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.750> a

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
I was concerned if this was say in a

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.660 
I was concerned if this was say in a
backpack<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.649> it<00:01:29.770> fell<00:01:29.920> sideways<00:01:30.189> would<00:01:30.579> it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
backpack and it fell sideways would it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.139 
backpack and it fell sideways would it
start<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.939> leak<00:01:31.119> water<00:01:31.390> all<00:01:31.630> over<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.899> place

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
start to leak water all over the place

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.830 
start to leak water all over the place
and<00:01:34.149> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.640> how<00:01:36.850> I'm<00:01:36.909> doing<00:01:37.299> it<00:01:37.390> now<00:01:37.539> there's

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
and this is how I'm doing it now there's

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.630 
and this is how I'm doing it now there's
no<00:01:38.020> water<00:01:38.289> coming<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:39.729> whatsoever<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
no water coming out whatsoever and you

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.690 
no water coming out whatsoever and you
probably<00:01:42.940> saw<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.270> earlier<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
probably saw this earlier but this you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.429 
probably saw this earlier but this you
attach<00:01:45.939> these<00:01:46.149> two<00:01:46.330> sections<00:01:46.869> together<00:01:47.020> this

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
attach these two sections together this

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.080 
attach these two sections together this
this<00:01:47.770> top<00:01:47.979> section<00:01:48.159> actually<00:01:48.549> screws<00:01:48.880> down

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
this top section actually screws down

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.910 
this top section actually screws down
into<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.479> bottom<00:01:49.780> section<00:01:49.990> it's<00:01:50.259> not<00:01:50.409> just<00:01:50.709> it

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
into the bottom section it's not just it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.529 
into the bottom section it's not just it
doesn't<00:01:51.189> click<00:01:51.459> in<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.729> actually<00:01:52.090> screws<00:01:52.390> down

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
doesn't click in it actually screws down

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.139 
doesn't click in it actually screws down
in<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:52.899> there<00:01:53.049> are<00:01:53.170> threads<00:01:53.920> there<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.970> that

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
in so there are threads there and that

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.800 
in so there are threads there and that
keeps<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.599> from<00:01:55.840> actually<00:01:57.209> spilling<00:01:58.209> out<00:01:58.390> at

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
keeps it from actually spilling out at

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.529 
keeps it from actually spilling out at
all<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.860> both<00:02:00.069> those<00:02:00.250> tests<00:02:00.700> thumbs<00:02:01.149> up<00:02:01.360> on

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
all so both those tests thumbs up on

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.070 
all so both those tests thumbs up on
this<00:02:01.899> item<00:02:02.259> from<00:02:02.530> Stanley<00:02:03.869> here's<00:02:04.869> what<00:02:05.020> it

this item from Stanley here's what it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.059 
this item from Stanley here's what it
looks<00:02:05.229> like<00:02:05.319> when<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.619> separate<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.039> two

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
looks like when you separate the two

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.279 
looks like when you separate the two
parts<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.759> water<00:02:06.970> bottle<00:02:07.299> as<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.959> mentioned

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
parts of the water bottle as I mentioned

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.719 
parts of the water bottle as I mentioned
before<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.709> can<00:02:08.739> flip<00:02:09.069> this<00:02:09.220> portion<00:02:09.610> over

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
before you can flip this portion over

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.539 
before you can flip this portion over
and<00:02:10.030> use<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.959> as<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> cup<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.890> actually<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
and use it as a cup and actually the

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.660 
and use it as a cup and actually the
hinge<00:02:12.989> serves<00:02:13.989> as<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.859> kind<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.280> handle<00:02:15.609> on

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
hinge serves as like kind of a handle on

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.670 
hinge serves as like kind of a handle on
a<00:02:15.760> tea<00:02:15.970> cup<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.320> cool<00:02:17.650> little
