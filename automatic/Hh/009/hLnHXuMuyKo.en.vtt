 I greet you in the oldest council last in Cologne 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.300
 for 43 years and now in second generation

 Use it here with Mediterranean ambiance and bigger that's hard 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.390
 on a sunny day like today, what could be better than a delicious one? 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.550
 To see coffee 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.160
 Sit down that way 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.930
 so they enjoy one of our coffee specialties 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.649
 or enjoy a freshly tapped Kassel Cologne instead 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.649

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 combine it with a modern Mediterranean supply 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.100
 Have you ever tried the natural river? 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.540
 Ripened cured ham from Graz matured for 18 months 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.400
 or perhaps from the PK eaten 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.120
 the traditional way of preparing us 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.970
 come and be surprised 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.600
