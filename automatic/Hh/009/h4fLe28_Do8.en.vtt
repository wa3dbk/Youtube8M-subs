the<00:00:29.789> average<00:00:30.150> person<00:00:30.630> has<00:00:30.840> no<00:00:31.230> idea<00:00:31.619> how<00:00:31.920> many

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
the average person has no idea how many

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
the average person has no idea how many
species<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.660> songbirds<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.500> are<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.800> we

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
species of songbirds there are and we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.590 
species of songbirds there are and we
trapped<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> banned<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.180> know<00:00:36.300> over<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
trapped and banned you know over a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
trapped and banned you know over a
hundred<00:00:37.020> species<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
hundred species and and then you get to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.540 
hundred species and and then you get to
you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> show<00:00:39.719> them<00:00:40.129> 15<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.250> 20

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you know you get to show them 15 or 20

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.440 
you know you get to show them 15 or 20
species<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.600> morning<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> yeah

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
species you know in one morning so yeah

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
species you know in one morning so yeah
when<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.690> catch<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> bird<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.440> bring<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> back

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
when we catch a bird we do bring it back

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
when we catch a bird we do bring it back
to<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> centralized<00:00:47.489> place<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.360> songbirds

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
to a centralized place so with songbirds

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
to a centralized place so with songbirds
for<00:00:49.050> example<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> banding<00:00:50.700> station

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
for example we have the banding station

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.420 
for example we have the banding station
we<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> ten<00:00:52.199> nets<00:00:52.440> spread<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
we have the ten nets spread out in the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
we have the ten nets spread out in the
shrubs<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.000> every<00:00:54.180> half<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.510> hour<00:00:54.570> would<00:00:54.780> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
shrubs and every half an hour would go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.529 
shrubs and every half an hour would go
to<00:00:54.989> collect<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> birds<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.860> bring<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.129> back

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
to collect the birds and bring them back

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
to collect the birds and bring them back
and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.750> first<00:00:57.930> thing<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:59.070> we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and the first thing that we do when we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
and the first thing that we do when we
remove<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.730> from<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> carrying<00:01:00.570> bag<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
remove them from the carrying bag is to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
remove them from the carrying bag is to
put<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> band<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:02.210> because<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.960> key

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
put the band on because that is the key

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
put the band on because that is the key
piece<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.680> identifying<00:01:05.189> individuals<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
piece in identifying individuals you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
piece in identifying individuals you
know<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.840> lightweight<00:01:07.080> aluminum<00:01:07.470> band

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
know it's a lightweight aluminum band

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600 
know it's a lightweight aluminum band
that<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:09.840> fraction<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> percent<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> their

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that is a fraction of a percent of their

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.350 
that is a fraction of a percent of their
body<00:01:11.760> mass<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.619> we<00:01:13.619> take<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.130> wing<00:01:14.850> measurement

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
body mass and we take a wing measurement

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
body mass and we take a wing measurement
and<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> tail<00:01:15.750> measurement<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> body

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and a tail measurement and also a body

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
and a tail measurement and also a body
mass<00:01:17.790> measurement<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.110> really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
mass measurement and those are really

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.539 
mass measurement and those are really
important<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> sense<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
important just to get a sense of the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.530 
important just to get a sense of the
birds<00:01:20.729> general<00:01:21.330> size<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.540> measure

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
birds general size and then we measure

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
birds general size and then we measure
or<00:01:24.930> assess<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:26.159> other<00:01:26.310> things<00:01:26.610> including

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
or assess some other things including

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
or assess some other things including
their<00:01:27.180> fat<00:01:27.360> store<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> their<00:01:28.470> fuel<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
their fat store which is their fuel for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.819 
their fat store which is their fuel for
migration<00:01:29.490> their<00:01:30.450> muscle<00:01:30.900> build<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.560> because

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
migration their muscle build up because

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
migration their muscle build up because
a<00:01:32.040> lot<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.369> these<00:01:32.490> birds<00:01:32.700> during<00:01:32.970> migration

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
a lot of these birds during migration

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.569 
a lot of these birds during migration
will<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.900> add<00:01:34.049> muscle<00:01:34.619> mass<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.430> help

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
will actually add muscle mass to help

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
will actually add muscle mass to help
power<00:01:35.759> their<00:01:36.000> flights<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.560> we'll<00:01:37.740> look

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
power their flights and then we'll look

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
power their flights and then we'll look
at<00:01:37.979> their<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.340> molt<00:01:38.670> their<00:01:39.150> flight<00:01:39.450> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
at their body molt their flight for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.240 
at their body molt their flight for
their<00:01:39.750> molt<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> their<00:01:40.530> feather<00:01:41.460> condition

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
their molt and their feather condition

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
their molt and their feather condition
it<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.399> maybe<00:01:45.060> sometimes<00:01:45.630> easy<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.229> us<00:01:46.350> as

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it is maybe sometimes easy for us as

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
it is maybe sometimes easy for us as
humans<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> ourselves<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.939> separate

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
humans to think of ourselves as separate

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
humans to think of ourselves as separate
from<00:01:49.079> nature<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.070> something<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
from nature and so if something is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
from nature and so if something is
affecting<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> bird<00:01:51.000> population<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.810> how

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
affecting a bird population well how

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
affecting a bird population well how
does<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.829> affect<00:01:53.130> me<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
does that affect me but if you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.450 
does that affect me but if you
understand<00:01:55.229> ecology<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.070> everything

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
understand ecology and that everything

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580 
understand ecology and that everything
is<00:01:56.579> related<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:57.990> relying<00:01:58.350> on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
is related and that we are relying on

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
is related and that we are relying on
these<00:01:58.770> natural<00:01:59.189> environments<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:01.079> know

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
these natural environments you know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
these natural environments you know
everything<00:02:01.649> from<00:02:01.680> sunlight<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.369> moisture<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
everything from sunlight to moisture to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.029 
everything from sunlight to moisture to
the<00:02:03.390> nutrients<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> soil<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.270> see

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the nutrients in the soil that if we see

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
the nutrients in the soil that if we see
alarming<00:02:08.039> trends<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.840> common<00:02:09.840> bird<00:02:10.050> species

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
alarming trends in common bird species

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.830 
alarming trends in common bird species
which<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.280> actually<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.849> seen

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
which we actually have seen

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.210 
which we actually have seen
we<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.410> relatively<00:02:13.860> common

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
we see that some relatively common

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
we see that some relatively common

been<00:02:18.480> declining<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.140> well<00:02:19.739> as<00:02:19.950> some<00:02:20.160> species

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
been declining as well as some species

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
been declining as well as some species
we<00:02:20.730> think<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.269> more<00:02:21.450> endangered<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.470> those

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
we think of as more endangered and those

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.979 
we think of as more endangered and those
are<00:02:23.099> all<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.610> guess<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.300> could<00:02:24.420> say<00:02:24.540> measuring

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
are all I guess you could say measuring

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.229 
are all I guess you could say measuring
sticks<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.739> tell<00:02:25.920> us<00:02:26.040> about<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> health<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
sticks to tell us about the health of

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.900 
sticks to tell us about the health of
the<00:02:27.360> planet<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.280> mentioned<00:02:29.280> earlier<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.700> know

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the planet I mentioned earlier you know

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910 
the planet I mentioned earlier you know
I<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.269> use<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> word<00:02:31.019> connectivity<00:02:31.799> all

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
I like to use the word connectivity all

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.970 
I like to use the word connectivity all
the<00:02:32.069> time<00:02:32.220> because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.629> think<00:02:34.019> once<00:02:34.560> people<00:02:34.650> are

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the time because I think once people are

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610 
the time because I think once people are
made<00:02:35.190> aware<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.959> know<00:02:37.049> once<00:02:37.290> they're<00:02:37.410> made

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
made aware you know once they're made

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.300 
made aware you know once they're made
aware<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.580> requirements<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:41.190> know

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
aware of those requirements of you know

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.430 
aware of those requirements of you know
the<00:02:41.640> yellow<00:02:41.910> Warbler<00:02:42.480> say<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.930> breeds<00:02:43.230> in

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the yellow Warbler say that breeds in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.520 
the yellow Warbler say that breeds in
Alaska<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.790> winners<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.599> Brazil<00:02:46.230> or

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
Alaska and winners in Brazil or

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
Alaska and winners in Brazil or
somewhere<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.069> once<00:02:47.819> they're<00:02:47.970> made

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
somewhere like that once they're made

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 
somewhere like that once they're made
aware<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.450> those<00:02:48.900> those<00:02:49.500> needs<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.190> those

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
aware of those those needs and those

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.949 
aware of those those needs and those
requirements<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.030> species<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.599> think

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
requirements of that species I think

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.210 
requirements of that species I think
that<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:53.069> know<00:02:53.160> you've<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.610> scored<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.090> big

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that you know you've just scored a big

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.920 
that you know you've just scored a big
you<00:02:56.220> know<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.340> big<00:02:56.610> point<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:57.269> for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
you know a big point for for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.190 
you know a big point for for
conservation<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> future<00:02:59.280> because

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
conservation in the future because

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.240 
conservation in the future because
there's<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.319> half<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> battle<00:03:02.099> is

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
there's really half the battle is

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.760 
there's really half the battle is
