pretas timepiece and also the Oversoul

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.560 
pretas timepiece and also the Oversoul
edict<00:00:20.560> so<00:00:21.550> we're<00:00:21.910> going<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.090> start<00:00:22.119> off<00:00:22.359> here

edict so we're going to start off here

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.200 
edict so we're going to start off here
with<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.810> prettiest<00:00:23.199> timepiece<00:00:23.859> and<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
with the prettiest timepiece and this

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.349

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
one is from vault of glass and I believe

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.540 
one is from vault of glass and I believe
it<00:00:28.480> only<00:00:28.689> drops<00:00:29.259> from<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.830> gatekeeper

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
it only drops from the gatekeeper

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.410 
it only drops from the gatekeeper

fourth shot if one of your shots miss
the<00:00:59.620> best<00:00:59.829> thing<00:01:00.039> about<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.370> pretas

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
the best thing about the pretas

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.920 
the best thing about the pretas
timepiece<00:01:01.269> is<00:01:01.510> stability<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:03.930> highest

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
timepiece is stability as highest

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.410 
timepiece is stability as highest
stability<00:01:05.920> over<00:01:06.130> these<00:01:06.400> two<00:01:06.640> weapons<00:01:07.030> i'll<00:01:07.240> be

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
stability over these two weapons i'll be

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.109 
stability over these two weapons i'll be
reviewing<00:01:07.570> today<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.580> i<00:01:09.580> think<00:01:09.790> it's<00:01:09.909> what

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
reviewing today and i think it's what

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.440 
reviewing today and i think it's what
makes<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:10.600> weapon<00:01:11.049> special<00:01:11.770> i<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:13.210> for

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
makes this weapon special i look for

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.030 
makes this weapon special i look for
damage<00:01:13.630> comparisons<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.619> bottom<00:01:14.860> right

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
damage comparisons in the bottom right

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.640 
damage comparisons in the bottom right
corner<00:01:15.090> throughout<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> entire<00:01:16.570> PvE<00:01:17.049> section

of<00:01:17.829> this<00:01:17.979> video<00:01:18.159> so<00:01:18.909> if<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.150> look<00:01:19.329> at<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.570> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
of this video so if you look at it the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.429 
of this video so if you look at it the
timepiece<00:01:20.619> has<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.520> head<00:01:21.909> shot<00:01:22.119> of<00:01:22.210> 273<00:01:22.780> while

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
timepiece has a head shot of 273 while

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.590 
timepiece has a head shot of 273 while
the<00:01:23.590> edict<00:01:24.009> managed<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.520> get<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.790> head<00:01:25.210> shot<00:01:25.240> of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
the edict managed to get a head shot of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800 
the edict managed to get a head shot of
313<00:01:26.439> now<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.520> only<00:01:27.909> because<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.540> base

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
313 now this is only because of the base

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.780 
313 now this is only because of the base
damage<00:01:29.110> these<00:01:29.680> weapons<00:01:30.100> are<00:01:30.220> virtually

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
damage these weapons are virtually

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.719 
damage these weapons are virtually
identical<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.540> terms<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.899> impact<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.619> rate<00:01:33.579> of

identical in terms of impact and rate of

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.300 
identical in terms of impact and rate of
fire<00:01:34.000> but<00:01:34.570> there<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.840> something<00:01:35.140> special<00:01:35.409> but

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
fire but there is something special but

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.980 
fire but there is something special but
the<00:01:36.430> rate<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.610> fire<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.119> Oversoul<00:01:37.570> edict

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
the rate of fire of the Oversoul edict

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.200 
the rate of fire of the Oversoul edict
which<00:01:38.259> I'll<00:01:38.409> be<00:01:38.530> getting<00:01:38.680> into<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.759> second

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
which I'll be getting into in a second

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.620 
which I'll be getting into in a second
so<00:01:41.200> here's<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.979> Oversoul<00:01:42.460> edict<00:01:42.850> this<00:01:43.420> one

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
so here's the Oversoul edict this one

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.899 
so here's the Oversoul edict this one
drops<00:01:43.899> in<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.140> abyss<00:01:44.469> section<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.490> crotas

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
drops in the abyss section of the crotas

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.859 
drops in the abyss section of the crotas
end'<00:01:46.060> hardmode<00:01:46.750> raid<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.700> stats<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.689> these

end' hardmode raid on the stats of these

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.260 
end' hardmode raid on the stats of these
two<00:01:50.140> weapons<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.860> rate<00:01:51.040> of<00:01:51.070> fire<00:01:51.369> are

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
two weapons the rate of fire are

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.990 
two weapons the rate of fire are
identical<00:01:52.990> but<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.680> Oversoul<00:01:54.100> edict<00:01:54.490> gets

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
identical but the Oversoul edict gets

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.270 
identical but the Oversoul edict gets
Furcal<00:01:55.659> full<00:01:55.990> auto<00:01:56.170> which<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.680> find<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:57.040> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
Furcal full auto which you can find on a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.060 
Furcal full auto which you can find on a
lot<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.820> weapons<00:01:58.030> which<00:01:58.780> basically<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.710> hold

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
lot of weapons which basically you hold

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.830 
lot of weapons which basically you hold
down<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.369> trigger<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.119> fires<00:02:01.329> for<00:02:01.689> you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
down the trigger and it fires for you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.620 
down the trigger and it fires for you
but<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.860> cool<00:02:03.490> thing<00:02:03.520> about<00:02:03.789> this<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.299> it'll

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
but the cool thing about this is it'll

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.240 
but the cool thing about this is it'll
basically<00:02:04.810> maximize<00:02:05.590> your<00:02:05.770> fire<00:02:06.009> rate

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
basically maximize your fire rate

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.550

whereas on a weapons such as the

whereas on a weapons such as the
timepiece<00:02:09.130> you're<00:02:09.730> going<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.180> keep

clicking that trigger and over and over

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.920 
clicking that trigger and over and over
again<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:12.910> hard<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.240> consistently

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930

maximize<00:02:14.830> your<00:02:15.010> rate<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.370> fire

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
maximize your rate of fire

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180 
maximize your rate of fire
so<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.540> look<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.050> photo<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
so if you look in the photo in the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.600 
so if you look in the photo in the
bottom<00:02:18.490> right<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:20.290> average<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.370> was

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
bottom right the on average I was

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.270 
bottom right the on average I was
getting<00:02:21.880> around<00:02:22.000> 3.4<00:02:22.900> seconds<00:02:23.380> for<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.890> clip

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
getting around 3.4 seconds for the clip

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.720 
getting around 3.4 seconds for the clip
speed<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.760> 30<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.920> Oversoul<00:02:27.340> edict

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
speed of 30 and on the Oversoul edict

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.670 
speed of 30 and on the Oversoul edict
with<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> full<00:02:28.209> auto<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.810> would<00:02:29.290> get<00:02:29.470> an

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
with the full auto I would get an

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.940 
with the full auto I would get an
average<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.959> 3.3<00:02:31.959> seconds<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:32.770> not<00:02:32.890> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
average of 3.3 seconds so it's not a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.699 
average of 3.3 seconds so it's not a
whole<00:02:33.250> big<00:02:33.880> difference<00:02:34.270> at<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:34.959> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
whole big difference at all but it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.960 
whole big difference at all but it
definitely<00:02:35.920> makes<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.430> little<00:02:36.670> bit<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.880> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
definitely makes a little bit of a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.390 
definitely makes a little bit of a
difference<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:38.230> conclude<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.950> PvE

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400

section<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.330> review<00:02:40.540> I'd<00:02:41.410> have<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.920> give

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
section of this review I'd have to give

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.770 
section of this review I'd have to give
this<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.550> edict<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.390> got<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> higher

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
this one to the edict it's got a higher

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.490 
this one to the edict it's got a higher
base<00:02:44.019> damage<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.800> it's<00:02:45.250> virtually<00:02:45.730> acts<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
base damage and it's virtually acts the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.190 
base damage and it's virtually acts the
same<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.819> also<00:02:48.970> has<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.510> full<00:02:49.840> auto<00:02:50.080> mode

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
same and it also has that full auto mode

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
same and it also has that full auto mode
which<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:51.160> going<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> be<00:02:51.430> able<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
which you're going to be able to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.410 
which you're going to be able to
maximize<00:02:51.819> your<00:02:52.269> fire<00:02:52.600> right<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:54.549> edict<00:02:54.940> also

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
maximize your fire right the edict also

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.180 
maximize your fire right the edict also
gives<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.140> park<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.890> shoot

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
gives you the park that you can shoot

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.090 
gives you the park that you can shoot
through<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.700> knight's<00:02:58.470> wall<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.650> darkness

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
through a knight's wall of darkness

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.370 
through a knight's wall of darkness
which<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.180> shield<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:02.080> put<00:03:02.290> up

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
which is the shield that they put up

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.870 
which is the shield that they put up
when<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.680> attacking<00:03:03.100> them<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.850> be

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
when you're attacking them this can be

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.330 
when you're attacking them this can be
pretty<00:03:04.180> useful<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.870> strike<00:03:05.440> sisters<00:03:05.799> omni<00:03:06.220> go

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and can maybe be used in the raid but i

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.270 
and can maybe be used in the raid but i
don't<00:03:10.989> know<00:03:11.019> it's<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.380> it's<00:03:11.950> not<00:03:12.040> too

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

side<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.670> review<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.930> see<00:03:17.140> both<00:03:17.500> of

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
side of the review we can see both of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.949 
side of the review we can see both of
the<00:03:17.830> damage<00:03:18.220> stats<00:03:18.489> for<00:03:19.000> both<00:03:19.299> of<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.569> weapons

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the damage stats for both of the weapons

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.460 
the damage stats for both of the weapons
in<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.709> bottom<00:03:20.950> right<00:03:21.100> corner<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.989> oh<00:03:22.989> look

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
in the bottom right corner and oh look

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.710 
in the bottom right corner and oh look
at<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.620> they<00:03:24.010> look<00:03:24.220> pretty<00:03:24.250> similar<00:03:24.760> well

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
at that they look pretty similar well

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.190 
at that they look pretty similar well
they're<00:03:26.170> virtually<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.010> same<00:03:27.040> gun<00:03:28.200> basically

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
they're virtually the same gun basically

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.229 
they're virtually the same gun basically
the<00:03:29.940> main<00:03:30.940> differences<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.650> Oversoul<00:03:33.250> has

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
the main differences is the Oversoul has

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.240 
the main differences is the Oversoul has
a<00:03:34.269> little<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.470> quicker<00:03:35.709> fire<00:03:36.010> right

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
a little bit of a quicker fire right

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.949 
a little bit of a quicker fire right
because<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.910> benefit<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.450> full<00:03:37.720> auto

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
because of the benefit of the full auto

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.410 
because of the benefit of the full auto
perk<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.430> timepiece<00:03:39.910> has<00:03:40.150> better

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
perk and the timepiece has better

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.650 
perk and the timepiece has better
stability<00:03:41.400> which<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.579> more<00:03:42.790> valuable<00:03:43.000> well

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
stability which is more valuable well

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.400 
stability which is more valuable well
that's<00:03:43.989> sort<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.290> up<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.769> choose<00:03:45.070> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
that's sort of up to you to choose I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.560 
that's sort of up to you to choose I
personally<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.280> Oversoul<00:03:48.700> edict<00:03:49.359> a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
personally like the Oversoul edict a

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.270 
personally like the Oversoul edict a
little<00:03:49.930> better<00:03:50.140> just<00:03:50.230> because<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.920> full

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
little better just because of the full

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.729 
little better just because of the full
auto<00:03:51.600> makes<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:52.930> easy<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.470> hit

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
auto makes it really easy to hit

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.069 
auto makes it really easy to hit
consistent<00:03:54.519> head<00:03:54.670> shots<00:03:54.970> without<00:03:55.540> having<00:03:55.989> a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
consistent head shots without having a

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.890 
consistent head shots without having a
hammering<00:03:56.530> down<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.280> trigger<00:03:57.519> as<00:03:58.329> for<00:03:58.810> the

hammering down the trigger as for the

hammering down the trigger as for the
stability<00:03:59.140> both<00:03:59.950> weapons<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.819> perk<00:04:01.209> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
stability both weapons get a perk to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.800 
stability both weapons get a perk to
stabilize<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.900> weapon<00:04:02.380> however<00:04:03.100> the

edict gets fitted stock now I honestly

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.110 
edict gets fitted stock now I honestly
have<00:04:12.459> no<00:04:12.819> idea<00:04:13.319> why<00:04:14.319> perfect<00:04:14.950> balance<00:04:15.120> works

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.400 
have no idea why perfect balance works
way<00:04:16.389> better<00:04:16.419> than<00:04:16.780> fitted<00:04:17.139> fitted<00:04:17.530> stock

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410

way better than fitted fitted stock
these<00:04:20.410> stability<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.340> not<00:04:21.690> really<00:04:22.690> that

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
these stability is not really that

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.800 
these stability is not really that
noticeable<00:04:23.110> between<00:04:23.800> them<00:04:24.479> however<00:04:25.479> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
noticeable between them however the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.230 
noticeable between them however the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
stability on the timepiece is almost

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.110 
stability on the timepiece is almost
maxed

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
maxed

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.380 
maxed
okay<00:04:31.120> if<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.330> had<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:32.430> stayed<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.580> my<00:04:33.970> overall

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
okay if I had to stayed in my overall

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.290 
okay if I had to stayed in my overall
opinion<00:04:34.510> of<00:04:34.900> these<00:04:35.050> two<00:04:35.290> weapons<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:36.180> like<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
opinion of these two weapons I like the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.810 
opinion of these two weapons I like the
Oversoul<00:04:37.660> eating<00:04:37.930> better<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.530> this<00:04:39.340> is<00:04:39.550> just

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
Oversoul eating better and this is just

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.510 
Oversoul eating better and this is just
because<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.480> base<00:04:41.200> damage<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.040> full

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
because of the base damage and the full

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.060 
because of the base damage and the full
auto<00:04:42.670> park<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.840> personally<00:04:44.440> I'd<00:04:44.650> go<00:04:44.800> with<00:04:44.920> the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
auto park so personally I'd go with the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.160 
auto park so personally I'd go with the
Oversoul<00:04:45.520> edict<00:04:45.880> whoever<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.420> crucible<00:04:46.960> I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
Oversoul edict whoever and crucible I

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.620 
Oversoul edict whoever and crucible I
think<00:04:47.890> they<00:04:48.010> are<00:04:48.040> both<00:04:48.400> viable<00:04:48.970> options<00:04:49.360> and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
think they are both viable options and

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.440 
think they are both viable options and
they're<00:04:50.020> both<00:04:50.170> pretty<00:04:50.320> similar<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.760> they've

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
they're both pretty similar and they've

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.480 
they're both pretty similar and they've
become<00:04:52.660> really<00:04:53.020> useful<00:04:53.470> now<00:04:53.620> after<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.130> pulse

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
become really useful now after the pulse

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.810 
become really useful now after the pulse
