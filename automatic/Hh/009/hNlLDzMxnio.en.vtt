00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
issue this is a grab-bag saber I have

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.120 
issue this is a grab-bag saber I have
two<00:00:12.719> dark<00:00:12.929> standard<00:00:13.290> issues<00:00:13.590> they<00:00:13.740> both<00:00:13.950> in

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
two dark standard issues they both in

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.220 
two dark standard issues they both in
grab<00:00:14.309> bags<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.179> actually<00:00:15.360> pretty<00:00:15.960> happy

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
grab bags but I'm actually pretty happy

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.400 
grab bags but I'm actually pretty happy
with<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:16.560> they're<00:00:16.740> nice<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.090> has<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
with them they're nice this one has a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.099 
with them they're nice this one has a
mid-grade<00:00:19.410> blade<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.490> silver<00:00:20.939> blade<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
mid-grade blade the silver blade that I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.920 
mid-grade blade the silver blade that I
like<00:00:22.640> unlike<00:00:23.640> some<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> savers<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
like unlike some of the savers the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.019 
like unlike some of the savers the
emitter<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.740> removable<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> solid

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
emitter is not removable it's a solid

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
emitter is not removable it's a solid
piece<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> saber<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
piece of the saber I really like it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
piece of the saber I really like it
though<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.310> slanted<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.210> I'm<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.109> fond<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
though it's slanted and I'm very fond of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
though it's slanted and I'm very fond of
the<00:00:31.830> slanted<00:00:32.579> emitters<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.329> those<00:00:33.450> look

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the slanted emitters I think those look

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
the slanted emitters I think those look
really<00:00:33.840> nice<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.579> nice

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
really nice it's got these nice

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.680 
really nice it's got these nice
horizontal<00:00:36.649> grooves<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.540> pommel<00:00:39.540> right

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
horizontal grooves here and pommel right

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.360 
horizontal grooves here and pommel right
here<00:00:39.870> kind<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.260> basic<00:00:40.590> pommel<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.160> like

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
here kind of a basic pommel but I like

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.819 
here kind of a basic pommel but I like
it<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> stunt<00:00:42.780> saber<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.620> got

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
it it's a stunt saber so it's just got

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
it it's a stunt saber so it's just got
the<00:00:43.980> standard<00:00:44.760> guarded<00:00:45.539> switch<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.079> here

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the standard guarded switch right here

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229 
the standard guarded switch right here
now<00:00:46.950> being<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> grab-bag<00:00:47.430> saber<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
now being a grab-bag saber it's got a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
now being a grab-bag saber it's got a
couple<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.680> March<00:00:50.219> dings<00:00:50.670> on

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
couple of little little March dings on

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
couple of little little March dings on
it<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.329> couple<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.289> here

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it you see a couple of them right here

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.150 
it you see a couple of them right here
but<00:00:52.680> they're<00:00:52.800> minor<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:54.600> actually

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
but they're minor I like it I'm actually

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
but they're minor I like it I'm actually
very<00:00:56.160> happy<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> saber<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
very happy with the saber I have two and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.840 
very happy with the saber I have two and
the<00:00:58.890> interesting<00:00:59.250> thing<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> dart

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the interesting thing about the dart

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.610 
the interesting thing about the dart
standard<00:01:00.270> issue<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.109> comes<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.469> two

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
standard issue is that it comes in two

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.289 
standard issue is that it comes in two
different<00:01:01.649> versions<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.969> both<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:05.299> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
different versions and I have both and I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
different versions and I have both and I
can<00:01:06.630> show<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> difference<00:01:07.260> between<00:01:07.490> as

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
can show you the difference between as

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.250 
can show you the difference between as
which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.790> actually<00:01:09.420> probably<00:01:09.810> pretty

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
which is actually probably pretty

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
which is actually probably pretty
obvious<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.110> vertical

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
obvious you can get it with the vertical

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.179 
obvious you can get it with the vertical
grooves<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:15.060> without<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.070> what

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
grooves here or without now I know what

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.969 
grooves here or without now I know what
you're<00:01:17.310> thinking<00:01:17.670> prowl<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.240> one's<00:01:18.479> better

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
you're thinking prowl which one's better

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.999 
you're thinking prowl which one's better
well<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.909> personal<00:01:21.360> opinion<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.409> depends

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
well and my personal opinion it depends

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.899 
well and my personal opinion it depends
I<00:01:23.509> think<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.140> dart<00:01:25.920> standard<00:01:26.280> issue<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
I think the dart standard issue with the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.569 
I think the dart standard issue with the
vertical<00:01:27.420> grooves<00:01:27.689> looks<00:01:28.470> better<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
vertical grooves looks better I like

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
vertical grooves looks better I like
that<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.380> without<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that but I think the one without the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
that but I think the one without the
grooves<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.180> comfortable<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> hold<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
grooves is more comfortable to hold it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.219 
grooves is more comfortable to hold it
feels<00:01:34.530> better<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.009> me<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> grooves<00:01:36.810> look

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
feels better to me the grooves look

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
feels better to me the grooves look
fantastic<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.700> swinging<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
fantastic but when I'm swinging it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
fantastic but when I'm swinging it
around<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.750> extended<00:01:40.140> period<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.439> time

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
around for an extended period of time

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.130 
around for an extended period of time
when<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:40.920> practicing<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:42.659> starts<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
when I'm practicing it starts to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 
when I'm practicing it starts to
irritate<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.740> palms<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.670> whereas

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
irritate my palms a little bit whereas

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.319 
irritate my palms a little bit whereas
in<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.640> much<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.850> comfortable<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
in this one is much more comfortable to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:48.740 
in this one is much more comfortable to
hold

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
hold

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
hold
you<00:01:49.170> also<00:01:49.320> notice<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> haven't<00:01:50.310> an

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you also notice this one I haven't an

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
you also notice this one I haven't an
ultra<00:01:50.729> edge<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> sunrider's
