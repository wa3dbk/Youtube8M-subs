never cold enough to kill anything off

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.430 
never cold enough to kill anything off
and<00:02:06.630> we've<00:02:06.750> been<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.170> dry<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> past

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and we've been so dry the past

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.530 
and we've been so dry the past
a<00:02:08.500> couple<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.430> a<00:02:09.550> winters<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.150> that<00:02:10.390> they've

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
a couple of a winters to that they've

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.930 
a couple of a winters to that they've
been<00:02:10.750> really<00:02:11.380> able<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.860> breed<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:12.730> crazy

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
been really able to breed and go crazy

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.290 
been really able to breed and go crazy
here<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.440> sort<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.830> ignore<00:02:15.130> them<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
here so I just sort of ignore them and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.820 
here so I just sort of ignore them and
the<00:02:16.360> ants<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> garden<00:02:17.200> don't<00:02:17.380> bother<00:02:17.560> me

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
the ants in the garden don't bother me

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.400 
the ants in the garden don't bother me
at<00:02:17.920> all<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.730> their<00:02:18.850> purpose<00:02:19.210> but<00:02:20.080> in

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
at all they have their purpose but in

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.280 
at all they have their purpose but in
your<00:02:20.770> home<00:02:21.130> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.820> have<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.300> inside<00:02:22.960> your

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
your home if you have them inside your

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.650 
your home if you have them inside your
plants<00:02:23.740> inside<00:02:24.220> you're<00:02:24.730> probably<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.540> to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
plants inside you're probably going to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.270 
plants inside you're probably going to
want<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.990> do<00:02:26.140> something<00:02:26.620> about<00:02:26.740> it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
want to do something about it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.610 
want to do something about it
what<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.990> mix<00:02:29.710> up<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
what you can do is mix up a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.640 
what you can do is mix up a
half-strength<00:02:32.730> spray<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:34.260> insecticidal<00:02:35.260> soap

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
half-strength spray of insecticidal soap

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.580 
half-strength spray of insecticidal soap
and<00:02:35.920> water<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.270> can<00:02:37.480> spray<00:02:37.870> your<00:02:38.080> plants

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and water and you can spray your plants

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.920 
and water and you can spray your plants
what<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.370> want<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.420> inside

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
what you want to do is get really inside

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.140 
what you want to do is get really inside
the<00:02:41.140> nodes<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.770> underneath<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.520> leaves<00:02:42.760> too

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
the nodes and underneath the leaves too

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.570 
the nodes and underneath the leaves too
because<00:02:43.810> that's<00:02:43.930> where<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> insects<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:45.430> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
because that's where the insects like to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.940 
because that's where the insects like to
hang<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.630> may<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:47.080> be<00:02:47.320> able<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.620> just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
hang out and you may not be able to just

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.110 
hang out and you may not be able to just
see<00:02:48.160> them<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.550> you're<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.970> to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
see them but you're going to have to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.470 
see them but you're going to have to
really<00:02:49.390> look<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.530> your<00:02:50.800> plants<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.490> see<00:02:51.850> under

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
really look in your plants to see under

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.120 
really look in your plants to see under
underneath<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.990> leaves<00:02:53.200> or<00:02:53.530> wherever

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
underneath the leaves or wherever

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.630 
underneath the leaves or wherever
because<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:55.240> what<00:02:55.450> causing<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.640> you

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
because that it's what causing it so you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.180 
because that it's what causing it so you
spray<00:02:58.000> them<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.390> few<00:02:59.050> times<00:02:59.290> at<00:02:59.560> seven<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> ten

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
spray them a few times at seven to ten

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.420 
spray them a few times at seven to ten
day<00:03:00.360> intervals<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.750> then<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.950> insects

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
day intervals and then the insects

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.720 
day intervals and then the insects
should<00:03:03.820> be<00:03:03.970> gone<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> ants<00:03:04.810> will<00:03:05.140> go<00:03:05.290> too

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
should be gone and the ants will go too

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.270 
should be gone and the ants will go too
now<00:03:06.730> if<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.060> ants<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.570> in<00:03:08.110> your<00:03:08.560> plants<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
now if the ants are in your plants and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.490 
now if the ants are in your plants and
they're<00:03:09.520> really<00:03:09.780> bothering<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.960> what<00:03:11.380> you
