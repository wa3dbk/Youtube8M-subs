 Y 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the dukan diet 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 this diet so famous more for its 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.040
 controversies where his faithful followers 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.950
 and his not so loved detractors of his 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.869
 name the French doctor who is not 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.669

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 of euros to protect weight this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 shop takes in two stages four 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.910
 phases the first stage is related 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 with the loss of weight and the second 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.140
 stage is to stabilize that weight 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.140
 lost so as not to win again 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.579
 three essential things in the dukan diet 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.059
 one is the daily consumption of bran 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.770
 oatmeal the other is to perform 30 minutes of 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.510
 exercise and also drink liter and a half 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.580
 so let's see what this 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.130
 delicacy 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.160
 let's start looking at the first phase 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.010
 which is the attack is the shortest phase 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.990
 and effective but also the hardest you go 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.960
 to be in it depending on the kilos 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.820
 What do you want to lose 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 If you want to lose five kilos, you're going to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.520
 be in it from 12 days to 10 kilos 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.190
 three days if there are more than 10 kilos 5 days 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.560
 and if what you want is to lose more than 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.560
 20 kilos from 7 to 10 days 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.680
 this is a pure protein intake you're going 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.450
 to consume everything they want 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.200
 quantities and the times you want in the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.200

 the clear week those who want fish and 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.570
 seafood and molluscs 100 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060

 zero fat zero fat zero dairy 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.789
 sugar infusion drinks all but 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.800
 sugar you have to read very well the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.440
 labels in the supermarket before 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.590
 buy food so they do not have 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.510
 sugars and fats 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 coca-cola light 0 we can drink it and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.190
 obviously the water 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.550
 we can not go to consume vegetables 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.560
 but neither what meat like the duck 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.990
 nothing with oil the oil is prohibited 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 the olive oil even this way 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.370
 that will be good you have to acquire a very 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.910
 good pan with Teflon to be able to well 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.420
 prepare our food 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.340
 remember only protein and let's 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.350
 consume a spoonful of bran 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.190
 oats 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.490
 in phase 2 which is the cruise 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.450
 you are going to alternate the days 1 of protein 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.610
 pure and another of vegetables 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.879
 or you can also do it five days 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.440
 followed by protein and then five days 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.849
 followed combined with protein and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.420
 vegetables this notes a little 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:24.370
 including need to the facility of 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.000
 make a more varied recipes 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.950
 we include them vegetables 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.159
 except those who have a lot 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 starch like potatoes or potatoes 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.170
 etcetera and our influence we restrict 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.000
 also carrots and beetroot for the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.870
 amount of sugar that they contain 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.210
 let's now increase to two tablespoons per 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.610
 day the oat bran remembers to follow 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.800
 doing 30 minutes of daily exercise 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.490
 and consume water 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.770
 consolidation phase again is a 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.660
 risk phase since when our 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.750
 body is subjected to such a diet 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.820
 strict as the diet educated the body 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.830
 reacts and put resistance to a 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.440
 surprise weight loss 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.350
 how the consolidation phase is calculated 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.790
 as I know how long I have to be 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.120
 in her 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.509
 in the first stage that was two phases the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.580
 of attack and cruzeiro you will look at how many 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:28.360
 that you lost them and multiply them 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.699
 for 10 days if you lost 7 that kahlo 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.009
 because it's 70 days that you have to be 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.349
 in the consolidation stage 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.419
 we are going to add two slices of 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.330
 bran bread per day and 40 grams of 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.659
 semi-hard cheese but also twice a 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.990
 the week you can consume potatoes or rice 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:51.050
 or pasta to the whole remember that it is 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.670
 an option choose one do not combine them 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.070
 everyone 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.380
 two meals of galas a week that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.750
 consists of the gala dinner on the day 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.450
 has three strong meals breakfast 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.450
 lunch and dinner in one of them I go to 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:09.310
 to be able to eat everything I want 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:13.370
 example if one day I chose lunch 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.910
 If I feel like I will eat until poster 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.540
 I will remember are two days are two meals a 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.220
 the week 12 gala days we will be able to 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:28.240
 consume fruit remember then obviously 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.240
 that are a few small pieces 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.770
 and in the stabilization phase they are like 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.220
 giacomo tips 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.680

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.289
 keep taking the bran will open everything 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.349
 Thursday 2 Thursday of pure protein that 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.520
 the diet tells us that it recommends us 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:51.139
 for life to return on Thursdays to the stage of 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.990
 until the attack phase that was 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.830
 only consume protein all day 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.560

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.570
 the Lord never 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.730
 ensures his duncan dwarfs that if they continue 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.550
