that<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.290> possible<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.820> that's<00:03:34.030> what<00:03:34.240> this<00:03:34.390> is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
that is possible so that's what this is

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.960 
that is possible so that's what this is
saying<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.500> need<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.800> be<00:03:36.010> there<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.550> you
