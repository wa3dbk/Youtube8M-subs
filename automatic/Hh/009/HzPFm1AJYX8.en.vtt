00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
difficult because you know obviously
it's<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.659> easier<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> hit<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.259> two<00:01:52.409> ends

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's more easier to hit with two ends

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's more easier to hit with two ends
but<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.880> comes<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.299> lots<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
but also that comes with lots of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.190 
but also that comes with lots of
practice<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:55.200> backhand<00:01:55.530> grip<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.040> again

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
practice my backhand grip is again

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.590 
practice my backhand grip is again

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
pretty closed you know because I'm able

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
pretty closed you know because I'm able
to<00:02:00.750> hit<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.320> grip<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.680> backhand<00:02:01.920> slice

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
to hit with this grip a backhand slice

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.910 
to hit with this grip a backhand slice
and<00:02:02.790> also<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> backhand<00:02:04.020> topspin<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.710> all

wrist for the topspin with a two-handed
backhand<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.110> obviously<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> bit<00:02:10.860> more

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
