00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.440
 well let's see the testimony of my 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.500
 friend daniel ramÃ­rez 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.500
 he also had a severe case then of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.870
 Androgenic alopecia I already knew him in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.910
 the university and so I offered to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.830
 use the hair regenerator for that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.560
 he has used a lot of things 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.020
 like me you were his photos 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.930
 he started in this way with injuries 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.910
 severe I repeat it little by little it was 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.280
 finding therefore in the regenerator 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 capillary rc a solution for your 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.489
 problems he was not walking pictures every 15 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.080
 days to go seeing the advances was a 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.230
 agreement that we had left me and him in 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.360
 every 15 days send me photos and the very 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.580
 disciplinedly he did the key to 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.350
 that he could run the product was 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.000
 your discipline I thank you very much 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.040
 trust then all the patience and the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 discipline that he had when applying the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.900
 product there we see as leather 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.170
 scalp was reddening that is therefore a 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.150
 of the product characteristics 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.640
 blood starts to water and starts to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.610
 feed the scalp there we see 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.110
 that was already filling the head of the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.210
 new follicle 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.880
 and in the photos and they look like they are very 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.680
 are not photoshoped photos 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 edited in fact I wanted to leave it like that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.560
 not to miss that touch of reality 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.280
 from that home touch we see that little to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.240
 little gradually rises to populating 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 So , head your hair in this photo 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.340
 we also see the front 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.040
 box with hair all that is the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.869
 crown area soon 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.900
 gradually it will be filling up 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.470
 to be able to cover almost 80 per 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.830
 hundred 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.989
 When I talk with my clients they 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.540
 commented that the hair restorer not 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.820
 it's 100 is a lie no product 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.900
 you will be able to regenerate totally your 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.610
 hair in the case of my friend Daniel 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.860
 because in the crown part still 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.400
 you see true hair injuries like 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.750
 it was then it is more than restored and 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 already in this photo you see advances 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.350
 considerable all the forward part 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.760
 already super super populated 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.880
 in this we see how it goes forward 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.820
 It is gradually becoming populated 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.890
 the hair if they notice it is as with a 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.480
 opaque touch 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 but it is also part of the process and is 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.920
 which are one of the last of the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.700
 Last photos where the fort is coming 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.670
 strong advance are scarce 12 photos 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.290
 that I show here in the testimony and everything 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.500
 this is to realize that not 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.560
 nothing else is me but we have many 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.170
 people that are enjoying the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.489
 magic of capillary recovery of 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.989
 capillary regenerator rc thank you very much 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.989
 good afternoon friends
