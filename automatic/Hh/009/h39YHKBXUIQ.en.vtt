00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.790
 in his hometown Amsterdam 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.019
 Daniel rehabilitates the knight of one 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.699
 neck hernia 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.800
 a nasty injury that already caused him 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.669
 keep it aside for months 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.560
 rehabilitation 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.239
 does the 29 year old attacker on it 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.069
 complex of afc 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.319
 amateur club but the knight as a pupil 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.999
 started playing football 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.310
 I have to say it is already whole again 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.200
 long ago that I was a member here but 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.000
 it is really nice to come anyway 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.969
 least against those you still have 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.739
 play football and week and the knight can do this 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.899
 season do not always count on one 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.059
 base place but he is with three 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.129
 goals and some racist for sure 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.320
 important for the team ' 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.570
 the knight with the possibility of travel 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.429
 and travel that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.769
 at the end of January it will be with the attacker 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.359
 a neck hernia and injury 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.739
 which is not common at 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.940
 professional soccer players 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.649
 it is very rare anyway 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.839
 maybe shoot a colleague's menu 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.970
 but I think 5% of it is herne 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.530
 case read neck hernia so that he is 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.840
 just very few people have much 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.120
 a hernia without it being that it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.530
 so affects someone 's body 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
 it does not necessarily have to be a nerve 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.710
 tell and you need a little bit 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.610
 bad luck we have that 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.940
 then exactly 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.650
 nerve touches or I mentioned and in my 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 In that case it happened so what exactly 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.270
 The cause of this is it may be a few 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.600
 things are the I can not exactly 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.600
 put 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.620
 the editors work hard here every day 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 to its restored and it goes happy 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.610
 back in the right direction 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.440
 since actually twink him longer 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.470
 completely free of pain 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.450
 and you stand because I even immediately 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.960
 I started field training so that is 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 very good news 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.710
 it develops very well and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.840
 conditionally now also gets better and better 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.770
 but we are therefore the fifth trading 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.200
 to bite 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.060
 so that yes that still has time 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.979
 needed but actually only goes 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.399
 better and better 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.399
 no relapse 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 are no more professional players here 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.180
 rehabilitation 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.240
 when dirty with jg yes I did last month 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.050
 bible in the field often 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.310
 trained baby Landzaat Christian prong 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.310
 music sometimes 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.250
 sigthorsson disease yes many players 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.350
 actually sit with physio them 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.480
 here the possibility of second role he 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.350
 looks or give to go for security 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.710
 to make 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.350
 anyway but the knight or do you follow the 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.069
 Sep transactions currently 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.060
 Well I obviously follow closely 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.409
 see everything and yes I have a lot 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.079
 contacts with the club 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.980
 so that concerns skewers of climbing 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.599
 the doctor 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.549
 yes with the everyone there especially with the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.840
 doctor you because he has too 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.269
 Contact 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.250
 physio with and also with jessica all ours 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.689
 sport or the sports bag at my 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.269
 physionet 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.510
 and yes they keep close contact with each other 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.169
 about the developments and he good 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.209
 so yesterday I still spoke one 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:28.280
 who is also very interested so that 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.930
 is nice to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.370
 in order to be able to rehabilitate in this way you will 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.870
 more often in common 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.830
 he does start because then we really had 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.830
 still want to be with 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.400
 stefan jacolien all that 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.680
 yeah that just wrapped my neck 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.790
 and that was the one at that time 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.920
 in only what could be a bit 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.659
 help but now more in again 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.069
 the in the construction phase of it 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.760
 training process 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.260
 yes they have more time for me here 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.090
 So I'm really here twice a day 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.459
 are training with 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.690
 yes i come there to my face 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.290
 to show it 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.970
 all off work and say the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.650
 finishing rehabilitation that happens 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.810
 here it is difficult to say when the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.220
 knight again competitive fit is the attacker 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.120
 still in action this season 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.100
 come 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.730
 I am very much looking forward to working 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.160
 in order indeed 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.419
 again in early May to be with the group 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.459
 if we could get those play-offs then you can 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.900
 you stick to it for two weeks and that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.240
 could indeed mean that 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.889
 I certainly can minutes but I have we 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 assume that that he for it 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.970
 ends will just still be fit to it 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.330
 but that pride says it is 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.610
 very difficult if you have a problem 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.900
 say to the nervous system that I am 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.490
 restored 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.639
 with one there are with the other too 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.639
 to support 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.710
 I just want to add something 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.380
 to the season and at the moment 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.080
 is going really well 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.430
 I hope I'm still needed in the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.430
 rest of the season if I find again
