there<00:00:49.110> i<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.500> used<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.100> yet<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
there i have not used this yet but it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.389 
there i have not used this yet but it
looks<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> nice<00:00:51.649> color<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.980> my<00:00:53.070> skin

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
looks like it's a nice color for my skin

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.680 
looks like it's a nice color for my skin
i<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:53.969> color<00:00:54.180> match<00:00:54.300> that's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
i think it's a good color match that's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.790 
i think it's a good color match that's
one<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> sucks<00:00:55.590> when<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
one thing that kind of sucks when you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
one thing that kind of sucks when you
buy<00:00:55.949> stuff<00:00:56.219> off<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.329> Internet<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.899> general

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
buy stuff off of the Internet in general

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.750 
buy stuff off of the Internet in general
as<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.190> color<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.579> going

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
as you don't know if your color is going

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
as you don't know if your color is going
to<00:00:59.820> match<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.770> should<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.160> good

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to match so I think this should be good

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.939 
to match so I think this should be good
we<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.049> next<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.439> Devon<00:01:04.680> lorac
