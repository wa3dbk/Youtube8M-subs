00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.510
 very good the beds how are you in 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.230
 this video wanted to comment on what happened 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.770
 in episode 697 of the anime of one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.480
 piece when usov is ready to shoot 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.430
 to your home from the foundations of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 castle to save lucy from being 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.869
 become a toy in that same 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.060
 moment we can see that it is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.220
 trying hard because he wants to save 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.380
 your captain and because you know that if you sweat it 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.100
 touch forget your friend as if you never 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.170
 had existed at the time it was 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.720
 I had to shoot a projectile to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.790
 reach your home suddenly you have a 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.880
 vision of what would happen if it failed and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.770
 do not give your home later the vision 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.470
 of a suv changes and you can perceive the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.900
 aura of light and trafalgar the uis play with 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.870
 what executes the shot well and hits 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.379
 knocking out your home I make this video 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.930
 because this fact of episode 697 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.909
 confirm that he uses the hack and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 observation and that maybe in the future 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 I could master it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.719
 I think it's very important because 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 since the time skip occurred, many 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.890
 fans was shown curly about that very 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.020
 equals may use the hack and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.380
 what kind and finally we have confirmed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 that he uses used the observation that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.369
 moment of the episode the truth is that I 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.579
 He liked it a lot and I think he has 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.740
 quite relevant I have to mention that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.869
 when you have a vision of what is going 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.420
 to occur if the shot fails is already 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.399
 Check and keep a lot of similarity with the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.799
 moment in mardin ford when lucy goes to 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.990
 attack my hawk and suddenly see that if 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.349
 he had attacked would have cut the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.569
 arms good nothing else that 's all in the 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.810
 today's video if you liked the video 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.899
 I know that's how it is to subscribe to my channel 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.849
 to see more and give it a like comment if 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.399
 You want me to theorize about someone else 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.399
 one piece theme a greeting nothing more
