00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
a look now at the system and how it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
a look now at the system and how it
works<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.840> demonstration

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
works now this is for demonstration

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
works now this is for demonstration
purposes<00:01:34.770> only<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> cutaway<00:01:35.520> shot<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
basically fill up this reservoir right
here<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> unlike<00:01:40.710> other<00:01:40.890> containers<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here and unlike other containers in the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.749 
here and unlike other containers in the
market<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.200> reservoir<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.979> external<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
market this reservoir is external so

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
market this reservoir is external so
you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.630> there's<00:01:45.869> water<00:01:46.140> or

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you're going to see if there's water or

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
you're going to see if there's water or
not<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.979> need<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> add<00:01:47.369> water<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
not if you need to add water or not so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.569 
not if you need to add water or not so
that's<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.930> huge<00:01:49.439> looks<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> holds<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that's really huge looks like it holds a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
that's really huge looks like it holds a
good<00:01:50.820> amount<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> water<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.920> will

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
good amount of water and what will

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.020 
good amount of water and what will
happen<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:55.200> core<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:56.280> basically<00:01:56.579> soak

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
happen is the core will basically soak

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
happen is the core will basically soak
up<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.390> act<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> sponge<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> soak<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
up and act like a sponge and soak up the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 
up and act like a sponge and soak up the
water<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.460> roots<00:01:59.700> will<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> water

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
water the roots will get all the water

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.109 
water the roots will get all the water
it<00:02:00.990> needs<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.250> long<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> keep<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it needs and as long as you keep this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
it needs and as long as you keep this
full<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.600> plants<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.409> have<00:02:04.649> water<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.040> can't

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
full your plants will have water I can't

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.429 
full your plants will have water I can't
stress<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.790> enough<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.420> mean<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> takes<00:02:07.229> out

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
stress that enough I mean this takes out

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.130 
stress that enough I mean this takes out
a<00:02:07.770> whole<00:02:08.129> how<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:08.910> should<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.209> water<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:10.080> of
