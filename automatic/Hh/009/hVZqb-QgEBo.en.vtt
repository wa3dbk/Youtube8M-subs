 There is a program or to watch the video 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.550

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.160
 other services from Yandex 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.740
 standard video player is simple and convenient 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.430
 in use but not endowed with many 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.160
 functions and do not read all formats only 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.410
 most popular and as for the screen 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.170
 it's pretty nice to watch 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.720
 movies from additional features 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.580

 it has the highest sound quality 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.970
 therefore I recommend to buy something more

 powerful camera module 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.180

 as far as the camera interface 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.890
 everything is very convenient there are many 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.900
