and so I thought it'd be nice to be able
to<00:01:29.579> share<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.850> feeling<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.140> the

way you guys have you went across its

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050 
way you guys have you went across its
it's<00:01:34.110> something<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.100> different<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's something that's different you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.670 
it's something that's different you
can't<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.479> compare<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> anything<00:01:37.350> else

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
can't really compare it to anything else

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
can't really compare it to anything else
and<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.960> great

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

and do a somersault down some people

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.750 
and do a somersault down some people
might<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:31.970> want<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.530> know<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.070> goal<00:02:34.489> is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
to go across but if somebody doesn't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.430 
to go across but if somebody doesn't
want<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.330> fine<00:02:38.630> too<00:02:38.870> because

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
want to do that that's fine too because

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
want to do that that's fine too because
like<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.010> said<00:02:40.070> everybody's<00:02:40.820> idea<00:02:41.270> of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
like I said everybody's idea of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.860 
like I said everybody's idea of
accomplishment<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.350> different<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:44.330> we

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
accomplishment is different and so we we

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.320 
accomplishment is different and so we we
think<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.190> person's<00:02:46.580> scared<00:02:46.910> getting<00:02:47.209> up

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
think if a person's scared getting up

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.820 
think if a person's scared getting up
the<00:02:47.450> ladder<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.870> they<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.709> ladder

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the ladder and they get up the ladder

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.760 
the ladder and they get up the ladder
that's<00:02:49.190> great<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.570> just<00:02:51.200> want<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770
