mean<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.459> you<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.700> somebody<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.809> you<00:01:58.169> know

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
mean if you get somebody that's you know

mean if you get somebody that's you know
maybe<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.639> higher<00:01:59.639> level<00:01:59.999> drifter<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.359> just

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
maybe a higher level drifter and just

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.870 
maybe a higher level drifter and just
wants<00:02:01.139> to<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> tandem<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.279> find

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
that they'll do that sometimes in

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:05.239 
that they'll do that sometimes in
lobbies<00:02:04.439> they'll<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.709> kind<00:02:04.919> of<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.099> right

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
lobbies they'll just kind of get right

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.620 
lobbies they'll just kind of get right
up<00:02:05.369> next<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.669> you<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:05.909> try<00:02:05.999> to<00:02:06.059> tandem<00:02:06.450> with

did a mountain pass a random mountain

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.010 
did a mountain pass a random mountain
pass<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.030> had<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> friend<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.690> car<00:03:03.840> with

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
pass and I had a friend in the car with

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.390 
pass and I had a friend in the car with
me<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.830> were<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.070> know<00:03:05.160> obviously

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
me and we were you know obviously

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.060 
me and we were you know obviously
talking<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.180> whole<00:03:06.300> time<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.780> I'll<00:03:06.840> probably

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
talking the whole time so I'll probably

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.790 
talking the whole time so I'll probably
layer<00:03:08.070> music<00:03:08.700> over<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.060> video<00:03:09.300> because<00:03:10.140> it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
layer music over that video because it's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.760 
layer music over that video because it's
just<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.280> said<00:03:11.459> random<00:03:11.820> chatter<00:03:12.120> but<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
just like I said random chatter but the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.590 
just like I said random chatter but the
only<00:03:13.890> thing<00:03:13.980> about<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.640> run<00:03:15.000> was<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> fact

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
only thing about that run was the fact

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.759 
only thing about that run was the fact
that<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.840> rained<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.770> crazy<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:18.000> whole<00:03:18.209> time

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
that it rained like crazy the whole time

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.770 
that it rained like crazy the whole time
and<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.070> weird<00:03:20.250> because<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.269> started

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
and it was weird because when we started

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840 
and it was weird because when we started
it<00:03:21.959> was<00:03:22.050> completely<00:03:22.500> clear<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.670> we

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
it was completely clear and then we

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.970 
it was completely clear and then we
started<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:24.300> up<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.540> mountain<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:24.989> like

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
started to go up the mountain and like

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.580 
started to go up the mountain and like
halfway<00:03:26.220> up<00:03:26.550> just<00:03:27.090> started<00:03:27.600> pouring<00:03:28.080> down

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
halfway up just started pouring down

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.190 
halfway up just started pouring down
with<00:03:28.650> rain<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.340> crazy<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.360> we<00:03:30.959> ended<00:03:31.110> up

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
with rain like crazy and we ended up

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.630

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
knew about halfway through that that

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.070 
knew about halfway through that that
corner<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.140> kind<00:05:16.380> of<00:05:16.500> done<00:05:16.740> but<00:05:17.990> like<00:05:18.990> I<00:05:19.050> said

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080

there's<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.530> pretty<00:05:19.740> cool<00:05:19.890> glitch<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.760> GTA

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
there's a pretty cool glitch in GTA

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.180 
there's a pretty cool glitch in GTA
hopefully<00:05:21.840> by<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.410> time<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.800> guys<00:05:22.890> see<00:05:23.070> this

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
hopefully by the time you guys see this

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.770 
hopefully by the time you guys see this
video<00:05:23.430> hopefully<00:05:23.700> it<00:05:24.060> won't<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.360> patched

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
video hopefully it won't be patched

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.320 
video hopefully it won't be patched
because<00:05:25.740> I'm<00:05:25.830> gonna<00:05:25.920> try<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.430> go<00:05:26.550> back<00:05:26.760> into

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
because I'm gonna try and go back into

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.290 
because I'm gonna try and go back into
GTA<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.470> see<00:05:28.680> if<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.890> can<00:05:29.100> um<00:05:29.280> see<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.180> can

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
GTA and see if I can um see if I can

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.760 
GTA and see if I can um see if I can
actually<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.930> again<00:05:31.320> because<00:05:31.650> it's

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
actually do it again because it's

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.960 
actually do it again because it's
basically<00:05:31.919> basically<00:05:32.400> what<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:32.820> is

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
basically basically what it is is

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.920 
basically basically what it is is
another<00:05:33.210> glitch<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:33.630> allows<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.900> to

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
another glitch that allows you to

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.900 
another glitch that allows you to
duplicate<00:05:34.380> your<00:05:34.410> vehicles<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:34.980> then<00:05:35.580> sell

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
duplicate your vehicles and then sell

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.390 
duplicate your vehicles and then sell
them<00:05:36.030> again<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:37.440> can<00:05:37.560> get<00:05:37.710> news<00:05:38.130> and

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
them again and you can get news and

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.220 
them again and you can get news and
millions<00:05:38.700> and<00:05:38.880> millions<00:05:39.080> millions<00:05:40.080> of

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
millions and millions millions of

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.620 
millions and millions millions of
dollars<00:05:40.560> by<00:05:41.370> doing<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.760> in<00:05:41.790> a<00:05:41.940> very<00:05:42.300> very<00:05:42.510> short

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
dollars by doing it in a very very short

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.760 
dollars by doing it in a very very short
period<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.110> time<00:05:43.200> it's<00:05:43.410> probably<00:05:43.680> the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
period of time it's probably the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.170 
period of time it's probably the
quickest<00:05:44.250> money<00:05:44.460> glitch<00:05:44.700> you've<00:05:44.850> ever<00:05:45.030> been

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
I've ever been able to drift on one of

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.279 
I've ever been able to drift on one of
the<00:06:31.500> main<00:06:31.740> straights<00:06:32.400> you<00:06:33.030> can<00:06:33.270> whip<00:06:34.080> this

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
the main straights you can whip this

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.500 
the main straights you can whip this
truck<00:06:34.590> out<00:06:34.770> and<00:06:35.070> it'll<00:06:35.250> it'll<00:06:35.550> slide<00:06:36.030> in<00:06:36.419> a

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
truck out and it'll it'll slide in a

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.890 
truck out and it'll it'll slide in a
straight<00:06:36.870> line

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
straight line

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.450 
straight line
literally<00:06:38.169> drifted<00:06:38.680> sideways<00:06:39.160> along<00:06:39.340> the
