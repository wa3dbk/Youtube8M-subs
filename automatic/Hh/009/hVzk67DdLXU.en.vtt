rubberized so if you get a way to get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
rubberized so if you get a way to get
bait<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.280> there<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> um<00:01:00.739> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bait on there it's not going to um you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.900 
bait on there it's not going to um you
know<00:01:01.770> slip<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.399> hand

they're<00:01:03.840> leaving<00:01:04.049> direct<00:01:04.290> systems<00:01:04.559> really

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
they're leaving direct systems really

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.670 
they're leaving direct systems really
good<00:01:05.390> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> notch<00:01:06.720> system<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.500> really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
good it's a notch system but it's really

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.399 
good it's a notch system but it's really
smooth<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:08.670> done<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
smooth really well done it's you know it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
smooth really well done it's you know it
progresses<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:12.420> change<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
progresses really well to change it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
progresses really well to change it
right<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.650> smooth<00:01:14.040> knob<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> turn<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
right here very smooth knob to turn it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.789 
right here very smooth knob to turn it
you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.150> forward<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.110> backwards<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you know forward is more backwards is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.550 
you know forward is more backwards is
less<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.119> big<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.570> these<00:01:18.869> reels<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
less the big thing about these reels is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
less the big thing about these reels is
that<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:21.150> dual<00:01:21.930> drag<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.380> basically

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that they are a dual drag so basically

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.810 
that they are a dual drag so basically
what<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> means<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> drag

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
what that means is that there's a drag

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.039 
what that means is that there's a drag
you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.180> normally<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.810> conventional

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you know normally in most conventional

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
you know normally in most conventional
razors<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> drag<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.520> drag<00:01:26.820> plate

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
razors a drag right in here drag plate

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
razors a drag right in here drag plate
there's<00:01:27.869> also<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.500> side<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.860> cool

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's also one on this side it's cool

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.789 
there's also one on this side it's cool
so<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.820> push<00:01:30.060> together<00:01:30.360> evenly<00:01:30.689> making<00:01:31.530> for

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so they push together evenly making for

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.700 
so they push together evenly making for
double<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> drag<00:01:33.020> gear<00:01:34.020> ratio<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
double the drag gear ratio on this is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
double the drag gear ratio on this is
4.5<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.520> 1<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.030> got<00:01:36.150> 8<00:01:36.299> ball<00:01:36.540> bearings<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
4.5 to 1 it's got 8 ball bearings in it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
4.5 to 1 it's got 8 ball bearings in it
it's<00:01:37.229> nice<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> smooth<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.909> weighs<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's nice and smooth and it weighs just

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's nice and smooth and it weighs just
