dysfunction<00:02:18.130> progressed<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.730> point

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
dysfunction progressed to the point

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.640 
dysfunction progressed to the point
where<00:02:19.150> he<00:02:19.209> couldn't<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.600> around<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.260> he<00:02:20.440> was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
where he couldn't get around and he was

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
where he couldn't get around and he was
falling<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.340> dragging<00:02:21.850> his<00:02:22.030> rear<00:02:22.270> legs<00:02:22.540> when

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
falling and dragging his rear legs when

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.780 
falling and dragging his rear legs when
he<00:02:22.810> came<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:23.350> us<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.980> point<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.400> saw<00:02:27.610> him

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
he came to see us the point we saw him

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.300 
he came to see us the point we saw him
he<00:02:27.970> was<00:02:28.000> not<00:02:28.570> walking<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.590> moving<00:02:29.950> us<00:02:30.100> back

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
he was not walking but moving us back

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.940 
he was not walking but moving us back
legs<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.720> led<00:02:31.959> us<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.470> where<00:02:32.709> his

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
legs this led us to know where his

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.979 
legs this led us to know where his
problem<00:02:33.490> was<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:34.030> didn't<00:02:34.360> tell<00:02:34.510> us<00:02:34.660> what<00:02:34.870> it

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
problem was it didn't tell us what it

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.960 
problem was it didn't tell us what it
was<00:02:35.019> but<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.920> led<00:02:36.130> us<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.790> was

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
was but it led us to know that it was

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.710 
was but it led us to know that it was
what<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.300> call<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.600> t3<00:02:38.200> l3<00:02:38.590> myelopathy<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
what we call a t3 l3 myelopathy so the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.780 
what we call a t3 l3 myelopathy so the
next<00:02:40.750> step<00:02:41.110> was<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.680> diagnosis<00:02:42.340> problem

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
next step was to diagnosis problem

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.460 
next step was to diagnosis problem
definitively<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.720> that's<00:02:43.870> where<00:02:44.080> magnetic

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
definitively and that's where magnetic

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.400 
definitively and that's where magnetic
resonance<00:02:45.070> imaging<00:02:45.190> came<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> use

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
resonance imaging came in with the use

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.949 
resonance imaging came in with the use
of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.709> technology<00:02:50.920> with<00:02:51.580> MRI<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.750> were<00:02:52.810> able

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
of the technology with MRI we were able

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.410 
of the technology with MRI we were able
to<00:02:53.230> see<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.650> spinal<00:02:54.100> cord<00:02:54.370> we're<00:02:54.910> able<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.269> see

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
to see the spinal cord we're able to see

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.180 
to see the spinal cord we're able to see
all<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.750> soft<00:02:56.019> tissues<00:02:56.410> around<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.860> spinal

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
all the soft tissues around the spinal

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.740 
all the soft tissues around the spinal
cord<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.640> we're<00:02:57.820> actually<00:02:57.970> able<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.480> look

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
cord and we're actually able to look

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.470 
cord and we're actually able to look
inside<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.410> spinal<00:02:59.830> cord<00:03:00.010> by<00:03:00.730> doing<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:01.239> we

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
inside the spinal cord by doing so we

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.870 
inside the spinal cord by doing so we
were<00:03:01.600> able<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.959> identify<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.070> diagnose<00:03:03.610> a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
were able to identify and diagnose a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.509 
were able to identify and diagnose a
tumor<00:03:04.420> coming<00:03:05.110> from<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.500> meninges<00:03:06.070> which<00:03:06.310> are

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
tumor coming from the meninges which are

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.610 
tumor coming from the meninges which are
the<00:03:06.610> coverings<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.299> spinal<00:03:07.600> cord<00:03:07.989> that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the coverings of the spinal cord that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.460 
the coverings of the spinal cord that
was<00:03:08.799> growing<00:03:09.250> inside<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.540> meninges<00:03:11.080> which<00:03:11.290> is

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
was growing inside the meninges which is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.039 
was growing inside the meninges which is
like<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.680> covering<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.400> hot<00:03:12.549> dog<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.450> smoky

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
like the covering of a hot dog so smoky

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.020 
like the covering of a hot dog so smoky
had<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> tumor<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.860> growing<00:03:15.250> inside<00:03:15.580> his

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
had a tumor that was growing inside his

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.449 
had a tumor that was growing inside his
coverings<00:03:16.600> with<00:03:17.320> no<00:03:17.530> way<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.769> get<00:03:18.040> out<00:03:18.070> and

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
coverings with no way to get out and

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.490 
coverings with no way to get out and
only<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.000> grow<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.420> crush<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.930> spinal<00:03:20.350> cord

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
only to grow and crush the spinal cord

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.280 
only to grow and crush the spinal cord
inside<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.250> well<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.180> think<00:03:22.269> we<00:03:22.600> were<00:03:22.780> happy

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
inside of it well I think we were happy

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.509 
inside of it well I think we were happy
to<00:03:23.470> know<00:03:23.709> what<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.310> was<00:03:24.580> but<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.750> was<00:03:26.080> really

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
to know what it was but it was really

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.020 
to know what it was but it was really
scary<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:28.410> mr.<00:03:29.410> t<00:03:29.560> gawa<00:03:29.860> never<00:03:30.070> hesitated<00:03:30.880> as

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
scary and mr. t gawa never hesitated as

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.360 
scary and mr. t gawa never hesitated as
to<00:03:31.239> well<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:32.410> know<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.769> this<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.160> this

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
to well you know is this is this

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.729 
to well you know is this is this
operable<00:03:34.049> let's<00:03:35.049> go<00:03:35.230> through<00:03:35.440> with<00:03:35.620> an

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
operable let's go through with an

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.130 
operable let's go through with an
operation<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.360> smokies<00:03:37.870> case

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
operation and it was the smokies case

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.860 
operation and it was the smokies case
the<00:03:38.800> tumor<00:03:39.160> sat<00:03:39.459> in<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.760> location<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.360> lended

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
the tumor sat in a location that lended

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.970 
the tumor sat in a location that lended
itself to<00:03:41.740> surgical<00:03:42.520> interns

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
itself to surgical interns

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.490 
itself to surgical interns
and<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.909> surgery<00:03:44.330> was<00:03:44.569> the<00:03:44.599> directed<00:03:45.260> course

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and so surgery was the directed course

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.949 
and so surgery was the directed course
of<00:03:45.709> action<00:03:46.099> as<00:03:46.640> soon<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:46.909> dr.<00:03:47.060> Lane<00:03:47.420> was<00:03:47.599> out<00:03:47.780> of

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
of action as soon as dr. Lane was out of

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.339 
of action as soon as dr. Lane was out of
surgery<00:03:48.319> he<00:03:48.530> called<00:03:48.769> us<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.879> tell<00:03:50.090> us<00:03:50.299> what<00:03:51.170> he

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
surgery he called us to tell us what he

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.300 
surgery he called us to tell us what he
had<00:03:51.379> found<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.129> he<00:03:52.790> described<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.480> as<00:03:53.659> a<00:03:54.310> golf

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
had found and he described it as a golf

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.930 
had found and he described it as a golf
ball<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.330> stick<00:03:56.599> of<00:03:56.780> soft<00:03:57.080> butter<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.940> that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
ball in a stick of soft butter and that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.949 
ball in a stick of soft butter and that
he<00:03:59.180> was<00:03:59.330> able<00:03:59.599> to<00:03:59.780> just<00:04:00.519> pop<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.760> out<00:04:01.879> and<00:04:02.209> it

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
he was able to just pop it out and it

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.380 
he was able to just pop it out and it
came<00:04:03.170> right<00:04:03.470> out<00:04:03.500> there<00:04:04.280> was<00:04:04.459> no<00:04:04.760> he<00:04:05.180> didn't

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
came right out there was no he didn't

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.270 
came right out there was no he didn't
see<00:04:05.510> any<00:04:05.720> residual<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.470> mean<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.769> whole<00:04:06.980> thing

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
see any residual I mean the whole thing

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.789 
see any residual I mean the whole thing
just<00:04:07.310> literally<00:04:08.120> popped<00:04:08.750> out<00:04:08.959> when<00:04:09.260> he<00:04:09.379> opened

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
just literally popped out when he opened

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.250 
just literally popped out when he opened
up<00:04:09.920> his<00:04:09.980> spine<00:04:10.700> but<00:04:11.150> he<00:04:11.269> felt<00:04:11.480> very<00:04:11.660> confident

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
up his spine but he felt very confident

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.720 
up his spine but he felt very confident
that<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.920> surgery<00:04:13.310> would<00:04:13.489> be<00:04:13.579> very

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
that the surgery would be very
