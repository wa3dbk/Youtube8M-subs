00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.699 
looks kind of like a lighthouse area
just<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.630> big<00:03:08.170> rock<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:08.980> tall<00:03:09.370> tower<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.560> it

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
just a big rock with a tall tower and it

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.140 
just a big rock with a tall tower and it
happens<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.040> be<00:03:12.130> right<00:03:12.190> where<00:03:12.640> your<00:03:12.880> plane

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
happens to be right where your plane

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.479 
happens to be right where your plane
crashes<00:03:13.570> but<00:03:13.690> anyway<00:03:13.930> one<00:03:14.830> survivor<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.340> get

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
crashes but anyway one survivor you get

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.660 
crashes but anyway one survivor you get
down<00:03:15.640> in<00:03:15.880> there<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.630> just<00:03:17.549> kind<00:03:18.549> of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
down in there and then you just kind of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.140 
down in there and then you just kind of
get<00:03:18.820> stuck<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.780> city<00:03:20.049> called<00:03:20.650> rapture<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
that's your thumb into you just stuck

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.789 
that's your thumb into you just stuck
there<00:03:51.880> you<00:03:52.120> give<00:03:52.780> nowhere<00:03:53.110> else<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.350> go<00:03:53.380> we<00:03:53.620> can

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
there you give nowhere else to go we can

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.729 
there you give nowhere else to go we can
do<00:03:53.890> swim<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.370> ocean<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:55.209> die<00:03:55.480> or<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:56.590> going
