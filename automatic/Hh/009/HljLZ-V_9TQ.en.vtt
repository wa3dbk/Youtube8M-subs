a d-ring
on<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.850> top<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.630> again<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.079> can<00:01:36.259> be<00:01:36.289> easily

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
on the top and again that can be easily

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.649 
on the top and again that can be easily
adjusted<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:38.090> suit<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.509> trimmed<00:01:38.990> at<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.259> end

the<00:01:41.659> wing<00:01:41.780> itself<00:01:42.079> is<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:44.020> doughnut<00:01:45.020> star<00:01:45.530> wing

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
the wing itself is a doughnut star wing

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.109 
the wing itself is a doughnut star wing
so<00:01:46.340> you've<00:01:46.460> only<00:01:46.490> got<00:01:46.789> one<00:01:47.829> deflation<00:01:48.829> point

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
so you've only got one deflation point

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.660 
so you've only got one deflation point
with<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.299> inflator<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.020> top<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:51.350> well<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
with the inflator on the top as well the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.660 
with the inflator on the top as well the
wing<00:01:52.850> material<00:01:53.299> itself<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:54.920> high<00:01:55.189> ballistic

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
wing material itself is a high ballistic

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.359 
wing material itself is a high ballistic
nylon<00:01:55.880> outer<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.890> then<00:01:57.890> on<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.250> inside

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
nylon outer and then on the inside

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.490 
nylon outer and then on the inside
you've<00:01:58.729> got<00:01:58.939> another<00:01:59.240> layer<00:01:59.810> of<00:02:00.079> nylon

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
you've got another layer of nylon

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.679 
you've got another layer of nylon
material<00:02:00.740> as<00:02:01.159> well<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:01.880> providing<00:02:02.329> double

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
material as well just providing double

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.819 
material as well just providing double
protection<00:02:03.530> against<00:02:03.829> penetration<00:02:04.399> basically

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
protection against penetration basically

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.040 
protection against penetration basically
so<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.520> see<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.820> nicely<00:02:08.300> curved<00:02:08.720> all

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
so you can see it's nicely curved all

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.639 
so you can see it's nicely curved all
the<00:02:09.200> way<00:02:09.259> around

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
the way around

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.920 
the way around
it's<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.130> tops<00:02:10.399> any<00:02:10.700> air<00:02:11.360> getting<00:02:11.690> trapped

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's just tops any air getting trapped

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's just tops any air getting trapped
in<00:02:12.110> any<00:02:12.260> corners<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.970> deflate<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:14.570> any

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
in any corners so you can deflate in any

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.250 
in any corners so you can deflate in any
