00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.150
 Y 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.209
 first it's worth saying that it's the 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.460
 Platelet rich plasma 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.590
 the platelet-rich plasma is obtained 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.330
 of the patient's blood are obtained 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.180
 samples of the patient's blood in the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.660
 office obviously with technique 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.080
 aseptic and everything and you get quantities 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.890
 of small blood is not much and 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.030
 centrifuge preparing them for 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.440
 anticoagulant 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.960
 they are centrifuged to separate what 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.690
 it would be the red elements or the cells 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.670
 red of what plasma is plasma 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.729
 he still has cells no no it is not 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.710
 like water, nothing else, the red elements 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.379
 we do not discard them because they do not serve us and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.390
 of the plasma we still do not separate them into 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.269
 platelet poor plasma and rich plasma 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.850
 in platelets the platelets remain 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.010
 suspended in this plasma in a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.390
 very tiny fraction of this plasma and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.880
 what we do after this is 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.670
 activate those platelets to be able 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.070
 implant 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.470
 inside the dermis 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 so that these platelets start to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.510
 release growth factors 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.120
 growth factors are really the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.190
 utility of this treatment however 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.119
 to date they have not been able to isolate 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.979
 growth factors to be able 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.229
 apply directly and have the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.550
 same beneficial effect what has been seen 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.530
 and not only in aesthetic medicine 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.509
 but the first to use this type 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 of therapies were dentists for 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.710
 dental implants currently 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.900
 used in neurology in gynecology in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.440
 Orthopedics are used a lot in surgery 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.810
 reconstructive also because what is 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.100
 has seen is that these factors released 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.259
 by platelets factors of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.539
 growth because they have different 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.940
 functions in for example help that 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.240
 there is more irrigation that arrives more 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.729
 blood that is oxygenated more the tissue or 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.430
 that is in the case of fractures 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.170
 example that can be consolidated more 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.590
 quickly that fracture that is generated 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 new bone in those types of sites in the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.360
 aesthetic medicine has an application 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.170
 also because when putting these platelets 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.349
 that release those growth factors 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.239
 it has been seen that it starts to generate 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.150
 extracellular matrix that is finally what 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.160
 that the dermis predominates in the layer of the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.260
 skin that is called dermis and this matrix 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.580
 extracellular is hyaluronic acid 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.400
 elastin and collagen this collagen is what 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.739
 that gives attention to our skin that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.489
 young consistency 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.950
 then in the absence of injury can 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.230
 generate a greater amount of matrix 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.849
 extracellular and activate these cells that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.830
 produce an extracellular matrix that 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.110
 called fibroblasts is the biggest advantage 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.480
 that is observed when applying they go to 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.510
 implant platelet-rich plasma in the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.670
 skin and increases the proliferation of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.230
 fibroblasts increases the synthesis of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.930
 extracellular matrix mainly 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.910
 collagen type 3 and 4 that are not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.799
 scar when we sustain a wound 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.269
 Well, the same thing happens 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.670
 platelets release factors of 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.590
 growth and a scar forms but 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.620
 if we implant it in the dermis 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.480
 it turns out that the same type is not generated 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.180
 of collagen that is made into a scar 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.489
 It is not 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.180
 a repair of an injury if it's not 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:30.319
 regeneration with healthy tissue not a 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.450
 scar one at a time in this layer of 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.680
 the one on the skin is very interesting very 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.150
 interesting and used in 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.150
 facial rejuvenation for this
