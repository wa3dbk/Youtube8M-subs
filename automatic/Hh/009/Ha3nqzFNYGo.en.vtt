00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.250
 I have just come from Harry luck day 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.439
 Nils is a bit struck like a 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.840
 bit small bit of sinuses 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.910
 infections and so on we have ourselves 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.980
 too stupid to the theme of alcohol was 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.800
 many have asked the topic 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.840
 smoke and what causes smoking at 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.660
 us in the body it is so by the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.399
 smoke your lungs blisters the the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 Remove oxygen from the air 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.260
 be glued and thus channel blood 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.969
 absorb less oxygen at least 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.920
 the nutrient transport also to the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.660
 Muscles become less muscular 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.910
 it is also less oxygen 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.460
 so these just get tired quickly 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.170
 the smoking harms you in muscle building harms 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.929
 I'm just training this 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.460
 can not go full power it is in 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.230
 general still a bit extreme 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.670
 chili three boy like each one of 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.379
 you never know it has changed a bit 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.909
 more inquired about the topic and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.310
 a few things from the studio 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.180
 written out by washington 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.370
 university 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 the study is finished and there were eight 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.740
 not athletes need eight 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.610
 non-smoker why unfortunately not everything 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.100
 athlete's choice in the same conditions 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.090
 bmi old and so far everything alike 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.860
 tested and that one has the people 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 administered intravenously and then looked 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.020
 because people are just amino acid 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.150
 Muscle building I who more or less 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.070
 in the muscle had the radioactive 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.810
 marked with it protest without looking 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.140
 there they found out that at the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.300
 non-smokers much more irritates him 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.480
 Muscle was as with the smokers 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.760
 it gave me then because the champion team 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.950
 increase the rates must have 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.500
 assigned news evade clinical 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.970
 which regulates the muscle structure therefore 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.260
 take all the stuff too 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.600
 master team blogger etc 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.960
 that we are above the natural limits 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.570
 can go out higher masts trophy f 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.640
 box fekter that's already gone is 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.470
 it accelerates muscle breakdown 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.459
 normally inhibited by testosterone 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 and plays an extremely large role in 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.239
 Muscle loss that means in the end 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.510
 You can say that smoking 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.540
 you have to runway is damaged what it is 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.640
 on the fast probably 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.189
 the team becomes such a big event again 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.780
 a hood then you have to become yours 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.390
 Muscle structure can be significantly damaged 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 and also not so much staffa felt 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.150
 For example , once you go away 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.909
 Feel more about it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.189
 but on the duration has relatively large 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.959
 impact on muscle development thanks for 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.239
 See you soon again for a short time 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.730
 video now small information about the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.659
 smoke because I would often ask 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.540
 mentioned at the beginning 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.950
 I hope we like it we can get one 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.799
 thumbs up with me like it 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.859
 not down thumb it writes us 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.480
 criticism comments in any questions 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.569
 you can see below in the profile 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:05.189
 ask or be on the right 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:08.189
 Separate and by the way props absolutely 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.189
 and go 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.980
 so far living proof that i 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.330
 have found my luck if that with 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.880
 no longer works because it at least 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.800
 wonderful because you are my wonderful and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.110
 it still remains I am the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.110
 in love type still writing
