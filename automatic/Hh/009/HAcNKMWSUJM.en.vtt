00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.120
 hi hello here lyon I hope you are 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.010
 pretty good and good we are with a 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.740
 new map that I really liked 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.990
 rather this is very good and that 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.809
 let's continue this highway that 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.340
 we have here and it seems that around here 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.090
 some signs the truth that I have not seen 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:24.450
 itself completely fine the map so 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.120
 I will see it together with you jockey on jack 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.630
 frost I think it's for jack jack frost 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.689
 mainer 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.190
 says my new city what good is that 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.739
 treat the map that we will see little to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.360
 little but good we're going to issue those 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.610
 signs so let's go directly 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.850
 to begin with, here we are going to have a 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.230
 bridge ok the truth that looks pretty 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.269
 great to see this we go here and for 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.059
 We can already see what many are 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.579
 buildings actually too many so 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.519
 we are coming to the beginning in the middle of 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.640
 the highway because we have here a one 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:05.110
 good house of a building welcome to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 manhattan ok and it's great let's see and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.729
 good in itself is what this is about 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.610
 tower is huge I do not know what it is but 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.079
 good here is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.549
 itself as a first one because it is a 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.000
 map - where there are many skyscrapers 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.530
 that's all crystal by the way and in 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 everything can be accessed as you can see is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 He even has ladders and 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.259
 let's see here is this building 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.619
 white and big that also looks 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.390
 great we have here more buildings I do not know 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.409
 which is the highest one at a time we go 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.630
 to see ok and good this map is supposed to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.450
 is exported to two and will say the times 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.640
 supposes this Tuesday ported so there 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.220
 a bed in a church that how weird 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.479
 but good, let's continue, we continue 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.450
 well here we have many buildings 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.909
 many many we are going to go between 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.850
 them and I do not know if there are hidden things 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.069
 chests or something like that but it would be 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.310
 interesting that it existed or also 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.689
 even that this is kind of like 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.520
 survival map would also be 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.369
 great is supposed to be these 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 roads or something like that I do not have it very 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.360
 clear but good one that great weather 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.520
 to see we went up and here I stay so that 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 I hope that nothing of certain does not have until 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.090
 the trampoline cited to throw himself up 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.950
 ok to this and a lot of nonsense we continue 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 watching and this is a black building 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.209
 this diamond that has something here 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.490
 I know it is going to even enter 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.220
 one of these and good also if you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.510
 they ask where they can download it and 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.630
 others I suppose this is like a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.450
 kind of elevator so let's see we're going 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.490
 let's try to enter here and see 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.680
 that in here in 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.880
 or that they are only rooms do not have 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.490
 nothing but it's pretty good to see we're going 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.980
 to turn up turn up ups up heard 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.140
 but there is a spider 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.940
 ok I tell you this would be great for a 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.870
 survival map this is all from 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.849
 crystal or that looks great with a good 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.810
 texture this would be excellent it would look 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.970
 perfect 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.700
 um look here is how he is all the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.440
 freedom but it's a little cactus man 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.530
 good is that he does not look like a man 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.140
 cactus I do not know you think about this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.610
 great and good in itself nothing else is a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.629
 small glance I guess we made them 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.950
 to beat that or it will be the other I do not think 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.379
 that we go have the same height that is 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.780
 the maximum to new is bigger thesis and 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.730
 this is the biggest one so far and 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.650
 well over there we have one diamond and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.959
 well this is a huge huge city 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.870
 huge and already look at them for it 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.700
 interesting things over there and when 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 I will also let you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.349
 investigate the map download you can 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.430
 be in the description and not also 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.859
 here we can put our helicopter 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.019
 gave them is pretty cool this huge 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.930
 city ​​out there and other houses houses 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.870
 green more bridges this huge bridge 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.690
 It's great I liked it a lot 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.090
 I say I have not seen it complete the first 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.010
 time is with you very nice already 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.660
 and I do not hope you liked it here 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.300
 like a city a little smaller 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.150
 simpler and far from all that chaos 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.879
 of the buildings so I do not expect that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.470
 you liked this is the subject for me 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.600
 they like it a lot they already know the download in 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.130
 the inscription and nothing do not forget 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.740
 subscribe if you have not yet done 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.740
 like to comment to share it with your 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 friends on social networks so that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.490
 we can continue to keep them bringing 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.580
 maps as well as these 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.190
 and there says mindshare and ok and good are 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.740
 the initials so I do not understand anything 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.979
 very well what's going on all of them 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.500
 these corridors I want to think that they are not 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.120
 the truth I do not know I do not know you leave 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.669
 in the comments that is exposed that is 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.070
 all this I suppose that yes they must be 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.660
 as they are not simply streets or something 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.300
 so there is a pig that does not exist in the middle 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.760
 lost says juana girdle where where is 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.380
 my house does not know what but not so 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.530
 I hope you liked it and we'll see each other 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.270
 in the next video see you later 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.270
 original beautiful beautiful
