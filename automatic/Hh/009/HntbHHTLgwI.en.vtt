00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.200 
where nobody shoots me down this was one
of<00:02:24.330> those<00:02:24.480> games<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.670> numbers<00:02:26.970> just

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
of those games to see the numbers just

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.289 
of those games to see the numbers just
keep<00:02:27.240> piling<00:02:27.600> up<00:02:28.490> but<00:02:29.490> under

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
keep piling up but under

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.270 
keep piling up but under
and<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.159> did<00:02:34.459> manage<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.940> kill<00:02:35.180> me

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and I think that did manage to kill me

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.000 
and I think that did manage to kill me
back<00:02:37.280> there

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
back there

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.710 
back there
