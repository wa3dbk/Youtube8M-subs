00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 Tokyo 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.480
 greetings gal that andrÃ© we are 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 back in the deadly kombat 10 for one more 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 tutorial on how this time the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.500
 jacques you are in the hyper games 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 well guys with the devastating and very 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.110
 easy with jacques 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.900
 come on let's get one begins 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 with a very simple movement that is 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.140
 headbanging that punch what 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.900
 usually he sent a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.480
 bit far but if we do not 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.170
 have held by a civilian only to delay 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.580
 a little bit like your opponent gives 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.410
 here every on the floor 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.079
 Ah I did not say but if you need the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.210
 five conversions of these scams these 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.320
 commands the conversion is in the description 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 if you're playing in another 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.690
 platform than Playstation 4 as well 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.380
 since they are however gone up with that 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.450
 if the gift 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.119
 You have to jump for a neutral jump. 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.090
 up and push the triangle to him 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.560
 gives more a helmet give and has opponent that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 fall again 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310
 thus 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 right while the opponent is in the air 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 We have to get it right with the way out. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.020
 that is square squares and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.820
 after the air strike that is forward 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.939
 square and we end people 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 cancels the airstrike with the grab 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.460
 game and then you can press the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.740
 usually lost lost by everyone 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.979
 so in the local mind it causes more damage or 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.970
 No, but it's what I do. 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 only there it is and if it has its 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.220
 their peculiarities because you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.119
 perceived flax in the steps that people 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:12.299
 splices a combo like what we people do 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.700
 does this in fact contrary to the 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.250
 special that we cancel a combo 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.829
 not special 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.630
 we make the whole move at once 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:27.810
 only here we'll wait for a 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.450
 we have to have a little time 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.310
 between a combo and the other between the output 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.150
 field and air raid 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.610
 It is not to make direct because otherwise not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.130
 I leave or if there is going to be something else 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.150
 now it does not go so we have to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.640
 do is take it easy first exit 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.590
 field when he finishes people 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.360
 amendment in the other congo as proponent 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 he will be in the will be at the author is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.640
 long enough that you can 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.370
 send the two combos and take a break 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.780
 between them then let's see how it is until 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.780
 the field output part 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.090
 ready you saw that your relative 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.560
 spent a lot of time on top is in that 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 time we'll get him with a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.450
 Air raid and finish I did not get you 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.319
 Let's see how the combo is now. 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.319
 complete 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.100
 there 32% as fairly easy enough 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:46.900
 Simple we only have you just have to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:48.459
 pick up the team team of these two as 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.329
 but it's easy we 'll be in the 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:57.609
 long time long enough to 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:59.470
 by Jacques to recover from this 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.980
 first combo that the field output is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.239
 of the air strike and soon thereafter 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.030
 you cancel a catch videos galore 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.870
 a fast as fast as easy and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.280
 destroyer is 32% strong enough 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.100
 let's have a look here on the x-ray 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.100
 point shot so we can compare to e 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.680
 does not spend any bar and can be done 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.360
 with any variation and takes the same 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.740
 thing than x-ray 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.470
