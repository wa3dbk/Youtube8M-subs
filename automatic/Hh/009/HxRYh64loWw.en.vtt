00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.320
 Transformers big event

 If this is one of the limited box sets released by botcon, it will be a thunderstorm 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.450
 I will 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.840
 This is what I bought and God Light 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.770
 This is now I bought these two on ebay 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.990
 There may be some people who are familiar with what they have heard 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.650
 That's right that thunderclap of you who long ago came out to Transformers called super-God Master Force 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.510
 is 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.720
 Jinjin is a Japanese character 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:03.140
 I am somewhat happy in because Transformers box Ipecac is 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.800
 This Tech Step Card and the Post Manual are included at the same time 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.990
 First, not here when the thunderclap of Eto 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:14.409
 Also here with technical data 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:20.079
 If there is no 8, it is written that what kind of character is lightning 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:22.810
 I can't read English at all, but if you go to a volunteer who can read English , you can go in the comments section 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:28.409
 Please tell me what is written 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.409
 It must have been a big success in the comics that were released in the other side ぇ 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.620
 N'ne might be some people with a form familiar of this track 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:41.630
 That's right even though this is I'm a convoy of deformation Heng Kei Transformers 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.049
 Will be re-color item of this person 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.780
 Was released from you is by Hasbro have a variety to other 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.070
 Ultra Magnus 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 And 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.160
 It had entered into the botcon 2008 of the limited box of economic layer items 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.370
 It has the optimistic Masukore of Shattered Glass 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.650
 Hmmm 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:09.180
 It's spectacular It's definitely about 10 pieces in all in this form 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.260
 Guy of that gold plating say gift has been that gold Pikakonboi to 10 people in the lottery 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.620
 I just do not have 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.620
 We have all followed Usa Let's take a good look at this vehicle mode 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:26.730
 This time there is a mark of the group here that it is a thunderstorm 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.660
 If you don't understand sin comics or not, what kind of activity does humanity play? 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.590
 I do not know 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.670
 Because deformation procedure you were secret base is Kedomo I have to show you 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.390
 I will transform this too 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.370
 toon 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.370
 At first we remove this 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 When expanded like this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
 Will be in 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.870
 And 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.700
 Expand 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.120
 Open legs 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.120
 Open the panel 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.410
 Open this panel 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.640
 Then 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.590
 Deploy like this 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.470
 Well I have been doing this much more to what I already do not even know was how many times deformation 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.190
 I do not really see the manual 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 You can easily do this Next bend this bumper inward 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.830
 It is here 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.270
 Next expand here to put out the head 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.270
 Put this back again 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.710
 I will rotate down from this chest Ye 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.560
 Lower the arm and lower this plate 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.490
 If you expand your head last 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.040
 There is no completion of unclosed robot mode 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.400
 Hmmm 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.799
 Some wrote in parentheses called the tech specs 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.739
 If you don't have it, you 've transformed the land ringing-this whole orange coloring and red 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.120
 I head is cool 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.410
 Then there is this characteristic emblem of this time in purple 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.860
 The lower body looks like this 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:36.449
 Black paint feet are red 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:41.610
 After that this part has yellow paint is applied in the black of molding color 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:47.039
 Now this part that there is this not a thunderclap Apparently in this behind 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:51.840
 It can be removed, but it seems like it will be kept like this 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:54.180
 Hey various But interference to do it to let's do a little this probably normal 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.960
 I can not save it anymore 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.400
 I wonder if you do I Motaseyo 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.759
 Oh old 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.759
 So let's make this part like this 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.610
 If I defeat this, I can hold it 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.810
 Hmm 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.560
 And becomes a little something like Ah was forced What a Once the trial and error have Mate 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.900
 I will 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.590
 It is in the state that I think now that it has a shield by expanding this part for a while 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.659
 I will 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.349
 It is not so weird though I collected various information on the Internet 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.630
 Where 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:34.760
 The frog of Sanno combined Transformers was using 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.760
 Weapons I will try to hold this too 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.310
 I feel like this 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.590
 Oh that's pretty good 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.330
 It looks cool but it's a bit short, but if you say it after all 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.289
 It's a dog 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.080
 Hm 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:57.520
 I wonder if this is something in the story 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:01.050
 Now let's arrange the convoys we showed you last time here 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.050
 First of all, Ultra Magnus 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.040
 Convoy 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.700
 And finally up the Shattered glass 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.320
 Hm 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.569
 It is spectacular 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.849
 No, this is my healing 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:23.420
 I can not collect 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:28.010
 When I was little, I was angry that only I could make it one piece 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.220
 Why is it? If you let me say it as a part of my ball 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.190
 This all 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.530
 Oh dear 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:37.520
 The characters are different, so there is no sense that you are buying the same thing 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.330
 Hmm 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.979
 So how was the review within the team without this time ? 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:50.590
 I I want these toys also collected we Well someday botcon go 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:56.629

 taitan 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:09.710
