 Egor and today we will talk with you 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.290

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.279
 you will burn the chair like the ground under 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.660
 thought this rather popular person 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.660
 butcher on the same name it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.250
 modeling 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.720
 and so immediately rush into the first doka but 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.130
 before i tell you about the unexpected 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.110
 abilities would like something 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.520
 clarify this is not familiar to us all 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.449
 card 584 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.370
 as a bunch of me already pumping something 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.590
 you see as old as your phonograph 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.900
 grannies this card is 554 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.300
 instead of the usual hook this machine for 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.370
 push yes yes just for push had 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500
 stich ability it resurrects the dead 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.239
 units from 2 to 5 at a time while they are 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.850
 live up to 75 seconds 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.130
 forget about red dot u which furion and 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.770
 what for brocade need to be more 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.110
 brutal create army of zombies 2 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
 the ability were scavengers better 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.160
 causes scarab from from the corpses of the fallen 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 scarab is not very strong at the beginning and 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.140
 have about 125 x nb but on the fourth 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.300
 leveling pump they have 800 x p and attack 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 under 40 they do not disappear with time and 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.250
 a maximum of such heaps could summon 8 as well 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 these bugs from the second level could 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.039
 burrow underground had a good 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.600
 radius of view 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.759
 so they could easily serve 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 free wards and block spawns or 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.410
 Opponent doing a review on the pooja I 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.300
 went out for a while for tea in the kitchen and and here 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.160
 what I saw when I came back I did 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.200
 so far I can not explain what it is but 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.900
 I hope he will review the map 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.600
 will explain what a pokemon is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.330
 or 3 sang went far beyond my 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 fantasy and it is called nekra genesis and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:05.200
 describe it so periodically creates 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.840
 a corpse of a unit in the belly of a butcher 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.030
 turn the way unload the arm and abdomen 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 can spice up their first ripe create 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 such units as warlock shooter top n and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.890
 hunter the first two are not so strong 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.690
 from the latter have already under 2000 x p and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.060
 the hunter has the moon passive 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.000
 so her attacks hit more than one 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.070
 pooja goal and knot also gave a push 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 these were flies way called for one flour 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.270
 which has certain when 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 making another fly using tubes 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.390
 he is only 30 x n but they have 83 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 percent chance of dodging and causing 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.170
 good damage to valka bad 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.400
 very influential so probably could 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 look yourself for puja WTO time
