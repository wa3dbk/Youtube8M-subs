00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tossed aside now this is a review unit

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
tossed aside now this is a review unit
box<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.890> often<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> contents<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.450> different

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
box so often the contents are different

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.290 
box so often the contents are different
from<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.350> you're<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> get

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
from what you're actually going to get

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.190 
from what you're actually going to get
but<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.660> they're<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> be

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
but they look like they're going to be

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.700 
but they look like they're going to be
fairly<00:00:40.620> close<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> same<00:00:42.500> Jam<00:00:43.500> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
fairly close so it's the same Jam one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.850 
fairly close so it's the same Jam one
battery<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.280> find<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> bold<00:00:45.780> 9900<00:00:46.440> and

the torch 9850 and European adapters

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
the torch 9850 and European adapters
because<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.600> meant

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

comparing it to the 9900 so you see it's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.510 
comparing it to the 9900 so you see it's
quite<00:02:42.530> smaller<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:44.060> not<00:02:44.270> made<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.600> premium

this<00:03:28.910> guy's<00:03:29.120> here<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.140> we're<00:03:30.290> told<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.590> due

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
this guy's here so we're told it's due

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
this guy's here so we're told it's due
to<00:03:30.830> accessories<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.400> they're<00:03:31.550> going<00:03:31.640> to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
to accessories that they're going to

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.760 
to accessories that they're going to
bring<00:03:31.880> out<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.330> works<00:03:32.900> better<00:03:33.170> having<00:03:33.410> the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
bring out it works better having the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.460 
bring out it works better having the
judgment<00:03:34.610> port<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.230> don't<00:03:39.380> have

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
judgment port like that so I don't have

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.830 
judgment port like that so I don't have
a<00:03:39.530> SIM<00:03:39.770> card<00:03:39.860> in<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.280> yet<00:03:40.670> but<00:03:41.060> we<00:03:41.180> will<00:03:41.360> pull

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
a SIM card in this yet but we will pull

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.200 
a SIM card in this yet but we will pull
it<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.310> what<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> do<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.610> review<00:03:43.910> which<00:03:44.030> will<00:03:44.120> be

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
it in what I do the review which will be

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.050 
it in what I do the review which will be
coming<00:03:44.360> soon<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:46.250> we'll<00:03:46.370> be<00:03:46.460> right<00:03:46.640> back<00:03:46.850> as
