00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
tub drain and the first time I was

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.330 
tub drain and the first time I was
confronted<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:09.719> these<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.440> baffled

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
confronted with these I was baffled

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700 
confronted with these I was baffled
I<00:00:11.550> never<00:00:12.090> installed<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.990> before

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
I never installed one of these before

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.640 
I never installed one of these before
and<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.820> bit<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.529> couldn't<00:00:16.529> figure

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and so a little bit I couldn't figure

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.720 
and so a little bit I couldn't figure
out<00:00:16.740> how<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:18.350> take<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.800> clean<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.430> was

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
out how to take it out to clean it was

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.090 
out how to take it out to clean it was
getting<00:00:21.029> clogged<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.230> knew<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.560> could<00:00:22.890> at

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
getting clogged and I knew I could at

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
getting clogged and I knew I could at
least<00:00:23.250> remove<00:00:23.730> some<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> material<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.720> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
least remove some of the material if I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
least remove some of the material if I
could<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.289> cap<00:00:25.650> off<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> couldn't

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
could get this cap off but I couldn't

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.790 
could get this cap off but I couldn't
figure<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.449> how<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.320> off

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
figure out how to get it off

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.189 
figure out how to get it off
twisting<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.519> there's<00:00:29.789> no<00:00:30.000> screws<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
twisting it there's no screws there and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
twisting it there's no screws there and
then<00:00:31.500> finally<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:32.340> day<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.850> discovered<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
then finally one day I discovered that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
then finally one day I discovered that
you<00:00:34.380> could<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.130> twist<00:00:35.489> off<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> top

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you could actually twist off the top

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.979 
you could actually twist off the top
you<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.870> plug<00:00:37.350> plug<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.719> just<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you just plug plug it in just kind of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
you just plug plug it in just kind of
push<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> then<00:00:40.739> twist<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.969> top<00:00:42.270> off

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
push it down and then twist this top off

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.520 
push it down and then twist this top off
and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.100> comes<00:00:44.430> right<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:46.260> can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and then comes right off and you can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
and then comes right off and you can
take<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.190> try<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.300> appropriate<00:00:48.750> size

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
take what try to get an appropriate size

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.470 
take what try to get an appropriate size
screwdriver

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
screwdriver

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
screwdriver
sometimes<00:00:51.480> they're<00:00:52.260> threaded<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.039> one

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sometimes they're threaded and this one

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
sometimes they're threaded and this one
just<00:00:53.460> has<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> square<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.170> take

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just has a square in it so you just take

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.150 
just has a square in it so you just take
it<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> whole<00:01:01.980> thing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it and then turn it and the whole thing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.840 
it and then turn it and the whole thing
comes<00:01:02.340> off<00:01:03.199> as<00:01:04.199> simple<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
comes off as simple as that but it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
comes off as simple as that but it
literally<00:01:06.240> took<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.810> hours<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.170> figure<00:01:07.500> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
literally took me hours to figure this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.000 
literally took me hours to figure this
part<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.180> could<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:10.010> take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
part out and then you could just take

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
part out and then you could just take
some<00:01:11.250> needle<00:01:11.580> nose<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.299> clean<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.799> clogged
