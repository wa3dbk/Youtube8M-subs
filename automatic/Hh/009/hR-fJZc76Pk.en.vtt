 Metal cones can be purchased from the places where the cake material is sold, 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.180
 or ice cream cones can be covered with greaseproof paper. 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.580

 and enjoy your meal. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.240
 While making this recipe, the ones who do not have the cone are smaller than the cone dessert, 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.360
