00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello in this video i will tell about my 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.679
 experience of using oils for wood 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.049
 I have rake 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.770
 antiseptic oils and 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 teak oil tree oil 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:25.380
 Used to protect against moisture from 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 ultraviolet for example battery me 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.009
 the storeroom was kept but it was kept 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 on the balcony you can see how much 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.660
 she got tanned 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.410
 from ultraviolet rays here I have 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.059
 There is such a project where did letters and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 I wanted to soak them so that they are with me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 save for a long time and began to pick up 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 different types of oils and decided to try here 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.829
 These two oils I took a piece of the river and put 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.660
 several layers 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.970
 but rather 4 layers of bedspread I in a day 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.510
 let's start with antiseptic oil 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.630
 especially for a tree, let's see how 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.229
 she looks here this part is covered in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 one layer right here i have tags 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:29.330
 2 in 2 layers here here are three layers and 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.330
 there are already four layers 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.299
 Well, as you can see there is no particular difference and 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.180
 she is not particularly tinged 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.010
 slightly yellowish teak oil it 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 thicker than 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.130
 so antiseptic she here he stretches 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.620
 how if you do like that 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.760
 slightly darker and by example we see 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:01.200
 how it is darker 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:05.450
 one layer two layers three words and this one 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.670
 most part 4 layer is part 4 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.550
 more than a month has passed probably two 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.070
 months have passed teak oil so far 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.020
 pore smells pleasant smell after two 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.020
 of the month should have disappeared probably 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.510
 I didnâ€™t really like it though I can 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.240
 say, both are worthy of oil can 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.110
 apply they reveal a good texture 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.880
 the tree is transparent enough if the tree 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.500
 has a nice beautiful texture especially 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.260
 it concerns the expensive wood 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.970
 these oils are quite suitable than you 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.890
 cover your crafts to 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.459
 prefer butter 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:02.030
 stain can be varnish that I still worth 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.030
 try thanks bye
