so this version of the v6 is strapped to
their<00:00:39.260> d3<00:00:39.770> engine<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:40.970> it's<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.210> turbo<00:00:41.510> diesel

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
their d3 engine so it's a turbo diesel

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.500 
their d3 engine so it's a turbo diesel
capable<00:00:42.290> of<00:00:42.379> using<00:00:42.760> 163<00:00:43.760> great<00:00:44.000> course<00:00:44.239> power
