00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this kind of blockade bit where you can

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
this kind of blockade bit where you can
like<00:00:47.460> stop<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.239> van<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> makes<00:00:48.960> sense<00:00:49.200> or

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
like stop the van if that makes sense or

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
like stop the van if that makes sense or
you<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.980> blockade<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:51.030> wait

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you make a little blockade you wait

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
you make a little blockade you wait
there<00:00:51.750> until<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> van<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.649> comes<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there until the van actually comes to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
there until the van actually comes to
you<00:00:53.340> shoot<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> driver<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you shoot the driver and then get in the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.760 
you shoot the driver and then get in the
van<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.510> almost<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.530> that's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
van and then that's almost it that's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.950 
van and then that's almost it that's
like<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.489> main<00:00:59.670> part<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> mission<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.750> in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like the main part of the mission but in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
like the main part of the mission but in
this<00:01:01.230> van<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.770> we're<00:01:01.920> inside<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.579> we've

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this van when we're inside it as we've

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
this van when we're inside it as we've
blocked<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> easier<00:01:04.379> easiest

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
blocked off because it's easier easiest

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.440 
blocked off because it's easier easiest
and<00:01:05.189> quickest<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:06.180> stop<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and quickest way to actually stop the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.780 
and quickest way to actually stop the
person<00:01:06.930> insider<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> press<00:01:08.490> start

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
person insider you want to press start

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
person insider you want to press start
and<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.960> location<00:01:10.229> ish<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.159> didn't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and go to this location ish I didn't

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.770 
and go to this location ish I didn't
know<00:01:11.490> where<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.390> knew<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> was

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
know where it was I just knew it was

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
know where it was I just knew it was
somewhere<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
somewhere around here and then if you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
somewhere around here and then if you
keep<00:01:15.630> driving<00:01:16.080> towards<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> waypoint<00:01:16.650> you'll

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
keep driving towards a waypoint you'll

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.880 
keep driving towards a waypoint you'll
actually<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> sport<00:01:18.869> location<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
actually see the sport location for this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
actually see the sport location for this
so<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so you can put it right there if you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
so you can put it right there if you
want<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.320> you'll<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> new<00:01:23.189> van
