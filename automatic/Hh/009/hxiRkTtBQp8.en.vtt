00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
clicked why is this light our things so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.050 
clicked why is this light our things so
attractive<00:00:21.720> it's<00:00:22.109> 3d<00:00:22.619> folks<00:00:23.100> things<00:00:23.820> like

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.290 

I<00:00:30.260> said<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:31.039> my<00:00:31.190> partners<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:32.090> if<00:00:32.210> you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
I said to my partners that if you

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.700 
I said to my partners that if you
weren't<00:00:32.540> in<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.750> light<00:00:33.020> our<00:00:33.170> business<00:00:33.590> you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
weren't in the light our business you

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.930 
weren't in the light our business you
wouldn't<00:00:34.040> be<00:00:34.130> in<00:00:34.220> the<00:00:34.310> mapping<00:00:34.489> business

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
wouldn't be in the mapping business

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.600 
wouldn't be in the mapping business
we've<00:00:35.420> been<00:00:35.540> able<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.870> go<00:00:36.050> from<00:00:36.470> ocean<00:00:37.190> depths

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
we've been able to go from ocean depths

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.450 
we've been able to go from ocean depths
right<00:00:38.060> to<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.540> surface<00:00:39.110> of<00:00:39.260> Mars<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.890> lidar

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
work it's a known technology but in 1998

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.140 
work it's a known technology but in 1998
we<00:00:48.739> started<00:00:49.100> actually<00:00:49.400> being<00:00:49.640> able<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.940> fly

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
we started actually being able to fly

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.700 
we started actually being able to fly
lidar<00:00:50.420> someone<00:00:51.019> reliably<00:00:51.559> without

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
instrument failure you had some rough

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.100 
instrument failure you had some rough
starts<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.519> not<00:00:55.879> all<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.540> elements<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:57.019> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
system were truly understood you know we

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.130 
system were truly understood you know we
had<00:01:01.220> three<00:01:01.460> foolish<00:01:01.820> parties<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.720> said<00:01:02.960> sure

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
had three foolish parties that said sure

had three foolish parties that said sure
I<00:01:03.170> can<00:01:03.500> do<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.650> why<00:01:03.979> don't<00:01:04.040> we<00:01:04.430> put<00:01:04.549> these

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
I can do it why don't we put these

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.170 
I can do it why don't we put these
sensitive<00:01:05.720> months<00:01:05.990> on<00:01:06.290> etiquette<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.640> nobody

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
sensitive months on etiquette but nobody

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.450 
sensitive months on etiquette but nobody
told<00:01:08.510> any<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.930> us<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.920> couldn't<00:01:10.250> really

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
told any of us that we couldn't really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.620 
told any of us that we couldn't really
do<00:01:10.729> what<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.210> were<00:01:11.330> trying<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:11.750> do<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.440> just

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
do what we were trying to do so we just

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.149 
do what we were trying to do so we just
when<00:01:14.630> you're<00:01:14.810> faced<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:15.409> a<00:01:15.560> steamrolling

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.430 
when you're faced with a steamrolling
technology<00:01:16.909> you<00:01:17.540> either<00:01:17.750> become<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> part<00:01:18.409> of

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
technology you either become a part of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.980 
technology you either become a part of
the<00:01:18.560> technology<00:01:19.130> or<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.280> part<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.640> road<00:01:19.990> you

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the technology or a part of the road you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.109 
the technology or a part of the road you
may<00:01:21.140> not<00:01:21.290> have<00:01:21.409> done<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.590> before<00:01:21.909> but<00:01:22.909> you're

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
may not have done it before but you're

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.000 
may not have done it before but you're
making<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> statement<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.500> can<00:01:24.770> meet

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
making the statement that you can meet

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.320 
making the statement that you can meet
the<00:01:25.159> specifications<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:25.970> are<00:01:26.150> being

technology<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:29.299> airplanes<00:01:29.689> is<00:01:29.869> definitely<00:01:30.350> a

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
technology in airplanes is definitely a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.719 
technology in airplanes is definitely a
challenge<00:01:30.830> no<00:01:30.950> question<00:01:31.280> ladder<00:01:31.490> was<00:01:31.700> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
challenge no question ladder was a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.120 
challenge no question ladder was a
challenge<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.869> first<00:01:33.110> time<00:01:33.290> we<00:01:33.470> tried<00:01:33.920> to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
challenge the first time we tried to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.340 
challenge the first time we tried to
view<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.430> data<00:01:34.640> we<00:01:34.880> had<00:01:35.030> no<00:01:35.240> idea<00:01:35.660> whether

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
view this data we had no idea whether

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.110 
view this data we had no idea whether
what<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.860> were<00:01:36.980> looking<00:01:37.400> at<00:01:37.550> was<00:01:37.940> actually

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
what we were looking at was actually

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.900 
what we were looking at was actually
what<00:01:38.540> we<00:01:38.660> flew<00:01:38.870> over<00:01:39.010> there<00:01:40.010> were<00:01:40.190> months<00:01:40.640> and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
what we flew over there were months and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.240 
what we flew over there were months and
months<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.480> months<00:01:41.540> where<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.380> didn't<00:01:43.130> go

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
months and months where we didn't go

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.110 
months and months where we didn't go
home<00:01:43.400> until<00:01:43.610> midnight

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
home until midnight

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.770 
home until midnight
it<00:01:44.870> was<00:01:45.020> just<00:01:45.260> like<00:01:45.440> climbing<00:01:45.740> Mount<00:01:46.280> Everest

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
it was just like climbing Mount Everest

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.990 
it was just like climbing Mount Everest
every<00:01:47.780> single<00:01:48.710> time<00:01:48.980> you<00:01:49.250> deliver<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.760> light

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
every single time you deliver a light

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000 
every single time you deliver a light
art<00:01:50.150> project<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.630> someone<00:01:51.110> about<00:01:51.410> two<00:01:51.800> weeks

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
art project to someone about two weeks

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.010 
art project to someone about two weeks
later<00:01:52.250> they<00:01:52.910> were<00:01:52.940> able<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.270> poke<00:01:53.480> lidar<00:01:53.720> down

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
later they were able to poke lidar down

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.510 
later they were able to poke lidar down
in<00:01:54.170> there<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.470> map<00:01:54.590> all<00:01:54.770> these<00:01:54.920> places<00:01:55.190> that

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
in there and map all these places that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.660 
in there and map all these places that
never<00:01:55.670> been<00:01:55.940> mapped<00:01:56.120> before<00:01:56.950> after<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.400> flying

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
never been mapped before after we flying

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.670 
never been mapped before after we flying
