00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.780
 very good good I am white 013 and today 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.180
 I bring you curiosities about minecraft 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.379
 where I will show you tips and tricks 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:19.009
 this so let the mess the 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.550
 good x-ray we go to it if we put a 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.990
 piston one the globe strong and we make a 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 circuit to activate 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.580
 we will get into this hole and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 when activating it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.360
 we get a vision in x-rays but that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.980
 we have around us to be able 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.980
 detect caves mines etc 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.740
 this also works if we 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.920
 we're 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.620
 in normal mode without creative mode 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.500
 and it will hurt us 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.840
 the tnt the tnt is one of the few 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.110
 objects that by breaking them in mode 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.850
 creative reports an object to you 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 inventory the others as you see 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.460
 disappear without maps 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 if we light it if it is in contact with 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 the water will not hurt what it has 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.810
 around that is to say nothing will break 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 good you have the cow 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.750
 if santiago the TNT and has nothing under 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 quality towards it collides with something 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.440
 now 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.650
 the cobweb if we approach 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.540
 the cobweb as you see we will win as 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.310
 you could have been with a 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.440
 material back ejected and it will give you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.440
 thread since it harms her so far 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.490
 it's crack I talk to you the scissors with the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.960
 scissors we can cut the lianas and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.030
 leaves in a very fast way and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.370
 get them in the inventories for later 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.560
 whatever it is to camouflage our house if it's 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.780
 in a tree and so on we can also 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 get the lawn 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.530
 water and lava wash as you can 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.350
 observe has a maximum distance of 4 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.640
 cubes when jumping sparks can ignite 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.009
 what you have around how you finished 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.829
 see and if you have an object inside you 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.720
 burning and disintegrating the water has 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.610
 as maximum space 8 cubes like 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.530
 maximum instance in Seville is something that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.810
 will drag the current 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.870
 a trick about water is that if not a 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.330
 square of 2 x 2 you throw water in both 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.300
 corners you 'll get infinite water from the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.700
 that you can pick up if you see that it's over 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.850
 another trick also about water is that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.920
 if a surface like this one lasts 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.920
 Water strips break up the whole 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.650
 exposing all the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.480
 seeds that we could say that 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.819
 we could find 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.150
 how to make a stone generator with 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.310
 water and washing we put water on one side 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.129
 wash the other one we wait for him to touch and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.920
 when you touch it will generate stone from this 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.120
 way we can get many stones 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 just move from the place 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.400
 another trick about water and water 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.710
 is that it washes the mother blocks of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
 lava when they come in contact with the 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.270
 obsidian obsidian is formed 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.540
 remember that it is one of the materials 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.550
 toughest of the game how to get more 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.180
 seeds with a hoe no matter the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.460
 material that is by clicking on the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.069
 grass we have more chance that 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.140
 give us between one and two seeds 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.489
 as you see friends who are very lucky 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.230
 but they usually last quite a bit 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.569
 materials from hell las a un sant 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.800
 As you can see it makes you slow down 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.560
 when you walk on them 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.650
 the truth if you learn it from galicia and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.710
 also until until always 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.620
 will turn off 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 and finally the web this serves to 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.280
 to illuminate 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.290
 milk as we have milk we 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.500
 we approach the cow and we give her a button 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.170
 right they tire that I eat that 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.790
 how to illuminate under water given that 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.090
 the torches are broken with the water that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.960
 we should use an illuminated pumpkin 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.420
 or houston 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.020
 how to stop both water and lava 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.710
 if we put water it will scatter others 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.840
 square if we put a poster the 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.270
 let's retire 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.180
 if we put a ladder now the same 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.000
 if we put an equal door 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.940
 the lava works the same way if 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.699
 we put a sign does not pass anything and if 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.670
 we put an equal staircase if we put 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.530
 a login door 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.840
 here an example is falling water and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.730
 is going there if we put a 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.040
 poster stops falling around here in the most 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.100
 up if we place others will remain 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.920
 in your position 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.090

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.290
 enough spaces will also grow 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.290
 a lawn is beautiful on your plot 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.030
 melons and pumpkins when we break a 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.940
 melon we will obtain bits of what 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.320
 It seems to be watermelon when we break a 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.750
 pumpkin we will get the pumpkin 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.470
 if we place the pumpkin in 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.830

 as long as we get the dye 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.500
 Clear 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.320
 those are the colors that there are all with 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.870
 different combinations that can be captured if 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.880
 we kill a sheep once we get 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.910
 one of wool however stretching the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.249
 we can get up to see if we 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.560
 come out 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.860
 up to 3 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.750
 as I have and then the wool we put the 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.330
 wool we put a side ink and 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.840
 we would get the nothing painted but 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.900
 we must consign this suitcase last 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.150
 the note blog if we have a note on 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.130
 blog depending on where we put the 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.840
 material to your solar side in a way or 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.139
 of another and the intonation that 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.139
 let's put 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.310
 this when you have a bucket underneath it sounds like 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.860
 capped is having the salty cubes a 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.550
 way direction and this has only 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.820
 one the same so I hope that I have 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.340
