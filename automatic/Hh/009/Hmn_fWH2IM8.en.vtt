 clock then sets everything up there 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 here you can configure these shortcuts 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.530
 system so you can change the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.510
 the only order you drag here you can 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.000
 adding more you can change the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 The size of the icons is 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.620
 When are they going to be there? 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.630
 you set everything here in this screen 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.060
 fifth they physical you have control 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 about when the volume and the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.350
 power button so you define what goes 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.750
 be the use of them here an energy you 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.160
 you can define which shortcuts will be 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.020
 displayed on that boy that appears 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.630
 when you press securely power button 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 then you hide or make visible is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.869
 Is that what you want 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.060
 here in the navigation bar you can 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.910
 change the buttons down below for you 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 change order here very fast 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.840
 they can and there and you can add 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.460
 more if you want you can click here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 a blank button appears there you come 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.709
 here you choose in this list what you go 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.360
 I do not want to have several options there. 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.060
 It 's a nice thing, it's not like that. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 leaves to be desired and here you have many 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.950
 Button options you want is only 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.160
 drag you remove simple around here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.650
 the ring navigation is when you slip 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.380
 your finger from the edge of the screen by default 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.650
 is the channel you can remove under the brand 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.840
 box here or you can leave in change 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.510
 to another function you want by 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
 example screenshot you just find it early 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.730
 cartel 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.430
 hence you had a screen client is fine 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.530
 nice this here in sound you can 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.600
 disable the warning when you 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.890
 increases the volume a high volume can 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.049
 damage your mission 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.680
 then you can clear if not 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.569
 we get the warning here installed 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.060
 This is very cool because the changes 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.310
 You want brown with pose you change 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 the density of the system and when you 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.989
 is an update you will not lose 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.239
 This next has to be redoing. 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.849
 so if you leave there marked those 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.599
 the pocket shortcuts that happens to you 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.329
 pulls it's yours inside the left boot or 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.120
 the right band of the screen you mark here 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.760
 You pull this track and then you go. 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.430
 define what happens when you do 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.230
 this would no longer be a system shortcut 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 you open an application or perform a 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.680
 function, and then you define the size of 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.169
 bar is when it will appear color 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.049
 Then it's really cool, that's you. 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.180
 difficult will be the full line lieu 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.200
 solution to the 1 always only on top or 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.939
 down 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.329
 then you can also do another one for 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.520
 right side there you can have two is well 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.220
 interesting to leave 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.310
 coming back here and the system animations 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.110
 So you can control is how it's going to be 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.320
 to animations with the app 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.510
 when you close you switch between a 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.310
 and then there you have all the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.890
 settings 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.570
 There's a lot to do here in 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.680
 page you can control 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.950
 notifications that stay down here 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.270
 nex-5 then here you come to define a 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.130
 not guilty for all 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.410
 Or you can put a different color 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.100
 for each application here in the case of e 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 mail 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.440
 I come here just teach time is that the 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.570
 led goes fishing is the range that goes 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.270
 stay then he asks you to pay screen 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.800
 to show with the edict to do here 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.890
 so you can see in search kalila 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.600
 white but then you can change how 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.800
 you want you will have frequency too 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.390
 What is he going to stay? 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 so just call the one who comes back from there 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.270
 You can do this for several 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.950
 different applications 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.180
 here also has the option of blinking when 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.640
 she's on 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.550
 then you can check this option or not 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.050
 who has time is you define the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.910
 interval 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.390
 It will keep flashing so it's okay. 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.980
 Nice this LED control has a high 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.400
 and missive that I found this fantastic 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.110
 feature you add the application there 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.530
 and hence every time you open the application 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.849
 to hide the navigation bar and then you 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.129
 will have 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.279
 she was full at that time you can 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.169
 put here some bar browser 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.399
 I want to go back and pull here. 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.020
 fast 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.360
 It's very cool, this is what you have here. 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.909
 control over which applications are 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.789
 be full screen or not and here is the 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.619
 last tried to retaliate when you 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.959
 this is a notification 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:36.629
 then you take your smartphone will 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:40.110
 feel for his sensor 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.729
 the gyroscope you are mobile and place and hence 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.709
 will ascend until it will show the 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.349
 notifications you received then you 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:48.539
 defines which notifications it will 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.939
 use this feature is that it will ascend 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:54.119
 the screen when you touch the phone and 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.559
 How did you see there, that's hp? 

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:59.159
 cool now not checked here at 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:00.929
 her camera is here the focus for 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.849
 see if it is fast and does not put the 

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:09.489
 object here I will change the focus plane and 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:12.529
 it takes a lot of time once more 

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:15.610
 it's very fast focus did not find speed 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.610
 camera trigger 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.069
 also fast you can see the 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:24.800
 camera is very good from hp 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.289
 in fact the overall performance is very good 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.939
 did you guys get to see if 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.240

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.949
 The fluency is fantastic and I had no 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.740
 problem in gaza wheel locking 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.960
 fantastic performance very good but 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.399
 worth it then checked for
