going to carefully unwrapped it try not
to<00:00:47.370> rip<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:50.850> bit

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to rip it but if you do a little bit

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.529 
to rip it but if you do a little bit
that's<00:00:51.329> okay<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.760> eat<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> chocolate

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that's okay so you can eat the chocolate

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.070 
that's okay so you can eat the chocolate
or<00:00:57.719> set<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> aside<00:01:02.030> I'm<00:01:03.030> setting<00:01:03.359> minus<00:01:03.570> ID<00:01:03.870> so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
or set it aside I'm setting minus ID so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.390 
or set it aside I'm setting minus ID so
I<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.379> still<00:01:04.589> talk<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> don't<00:01:06.840> need<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
I can still talk and you don't need the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
I can still talk and you don't need the
label<00:01:08.400> thingy<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.330> set<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.689> aside

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
label thingy so you can set that aside

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.550 
label thingy so you can set that aside
and<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> first<00:01:12.240> step<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> you're<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.080> sort<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and so first step is you're just sort of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.700 
and so first step is you're just sort of
scrunch<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.580> ball<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
scrunch it into a little ball and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.190 
scrunch it into a little ball and
whatever<00:01:16.710> color<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> kisses<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.990> want

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
whatever color the kisses then you want

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
whatever color the kisses then you want
to<00:01:19.259> try<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> inside<00:01:20.580> if

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
to try and make that on the inside if

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.749 
to try and make that on the inside if
that's<00:01:21.150> possible<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.700> scrunch<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:25.759> okay

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that's possible and scrunch it up okay

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
that's possible and scrunch it up okay
so<00:01:26.820> now<00:01:27.090> you've<00:01:27.210> got<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.960> ball<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
so now you've got like a little ball of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.999 
so now you've got like a little ball of
tinfoil<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.780> sort<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> take<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
tinfoil and so then you sort of take it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.210 
tinfoil and so then you sort of take it
under<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.490> hand<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.450> pinch<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.960> at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.979> top

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
under one hand you pinch it at the top

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
under one hand you pinch it at the top
to<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> point<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.310> then<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> can

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
to make like a point and then you can

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
to make like a point and then you can
flatten<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> against<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.750> table<00:01:43.170> or

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
flatten it against your table or

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.069 
flatten it against your table or
whatever<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:43.860> working<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:45.299> make<00:01:45.630> like
