00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 and hello to everyone with you like to play and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.780
 today i will devote this lesson to the game of dispute 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.540
 galactic adventures 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 quite a while of course did not shoot the video just 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.840
 I was allowed there as to say so 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 Well , I didn't have any ideas 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 ideas of what to take off and here I am 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 found a hole touched on such a subject 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.060
 install the game spore galactic 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.270
 adventures 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.739
 and where, of course, you can download a link 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.640
 Of course I will throw here in the description of course 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.100
 under the video, by the way, a good pollack 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.660
 downloaded here is quite simple and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.739
 well of course true that through the zone 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 In principle, this special honestly does not bother me 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 ok, let's get started 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.690
 when we download this dispute in general itself 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:07.470
 the game appears such a dispute folder 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:12.320
 we go in and go in rld dispute when we 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 go here we see the disputes of the setup open 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.860
 waiting for download 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.070
 common good leads rummaged and damn I'm not 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.060
 could normally find a sensible explanation 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.370
 how to install of course and download all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.590
 I somehow found one video of course 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 everything was clear enough there 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.640
 Of course a little bit yes yes any such 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:44.600
 garbage but I understand now there is a shorter 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.150
 the uninstall process as I installed 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.010
 controversy and now forgot this hand and and 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.010
 delete let remove and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.890
 Well, so all I deleted this old 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.060
 version that's when we went into a dispute with the stage 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.179
 offers must of course choose 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 Russian who wants English so on 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.300
 I accept and here we ask for the key 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 if someone is afraid admits that and that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.810
 same make the key drawings take it to this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.950
 the moment this question so to speak the whole 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.540
 Of course the answer is the key is the key and here 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.590
 There are three of them, but I usually use 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.400
 the first kind of always works who are not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.930
 believes you can try another insert and 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.950
 click next here choose select by 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.819
 recommended and where to install or 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.640
 non standard let where you want 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.030
 install I say I want to install it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.940
 on disk so why not take up space 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 on disk c, all else is disks 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.920
 set the decor a bit of course 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.580
 long but have to wait 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.200
 [music] 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:14.000
 and so here is my installation 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 so what do we do next 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 so farther farther farther what us to so 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.730
 what he 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.120
 well well it can it can 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.800
 I install everything like this 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.370
 let's say our coins here we remove why 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.210
 us this 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.350
 and here now the most important thing 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.840
 we go to the folder where the password was saved 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.250
 but preferably this folder we close 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.470
 because we need this here 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.720
 briefly in advance you can even come in here 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:58.200
 how to click the mouse wire here and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.880
 copy we copy now look for the folder 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.680
 dispute ben seems to be called will give 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.070
 carbine here it is, and here we insert our 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.860
 file set and choose to copy 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.350
 replacements 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.830
 all she copied I song why is it 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.200
 it was necessary it was necessary then what if 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.470
 would we just went into a dispute after 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.040
 just installed a sign would jump out 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.260
 that they say the type can not be run 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.940
 counted like that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.890
 reasons but in some people there 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.780
 let's say it's another reason but 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.840
 let's say from me and some people this 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.110
 pops up like that and in order to avoid this 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.020
 problems have either x like that 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.460
 fix principle the same thing now for 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 the idea should work game 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.320
 if you want go check if 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.740
 download starts then you have everything 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.740
 happened 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.010
 so they come in but I guess 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.140
 just billed the bill again as usual 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.030
 everything should work if we assume not 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.520
 earned first check let's say in 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.240
 which folder do you have to install 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.420
 I need to replace this file I hope I helped 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.540
 lovers of controversy nostalgia those who love 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.620
 of course ponastalize a little 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.730
 Thank you all for looking 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.300
