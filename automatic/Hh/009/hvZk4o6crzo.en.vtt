00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.560 
least on my skin tone the color fades
away<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.200> all<00:03:54.380> its<00:03:54.830> left<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.550> glitter<00:03:56.180> and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
away and all its left is glitter and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.630 
away and all its left is glitter and
that's<00:03:57.560> not<00:03:57.980> cute<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.880> me<00:03:59.000> cuz<00:03:59.360> glitter<00:04:00.250> has<00:04:01.250> a

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
that's not cute to me cuz glitter has a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.660 
that's not cute to me cuz glitter has a
way<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.850> making<00:04:02.600> oily<00:04:03.440> just<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> little<00:04:04.490> bit<00:04:04.580> of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
way of making oily just a little bit of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.070 
way of making oily just a little bit of
oiliness<00:04:04.970> kind<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.480> like<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.750> guess<00:04:05.960> it

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
oiliness kind of like I guess it

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.230 
oiliness kind of like I guess it
reflects<00:04:06.560> off<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.800> oil<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.940> makes<00:04:08.090> it

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
reflects off the oil and it makes it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.530 
reflects off the oil and it makes it
look<00:04:08.420> even<00:04:08.690> more<00:04:09.500> oilier<00:04:10.430> as<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.910> day<00:04:11.060> goes<00:04:11.300> on

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
look even more oilier as the day goes on

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.460 
look even more oilier as the day goes on
