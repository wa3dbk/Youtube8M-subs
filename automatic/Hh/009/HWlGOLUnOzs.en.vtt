drawing<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.930> got<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.260> off<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.620> side

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
drawing and I got that off to the side

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.690 
drawing and I got that off to the side
sort<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.569> guiding<00:02:23.569> me<00:02:23.720> through<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> say

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
sort of guiding me through like I say

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.789 
sort of guiding me through like I say
you<00:02:25.760> know<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.209> lay<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.900> blacks<00:02:27.170> that's

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
you know and I lay in the blacks that's

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.039 
you know and I lay in the blacks that's
when<00:02:28.040> pretty<00:02:28.730> much<00:02:28.910> done<00:02:29.239> with<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.599> inking

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
when pretty much done with the inking

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.650 
when pretty much done with the inking
part<00:02:30.349> of<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.739> process<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:31.700> basically

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
part of the process and then basically

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.930 
part of the process and then basically
it's<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.110> good<00:02:33.290> day<00:02:33.560> sometimes<00:02:34.160> two<00:02:34.400> days<00:02:34.610> maybe

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
it's a good day sometimes two days maybe

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.030 
it's a good day sometimes two days maybe
even<00:02:35.090> longer<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.780> between<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.799> when<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
even longer in between so when you

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.770
