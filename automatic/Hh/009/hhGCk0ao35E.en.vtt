shell<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> guess<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.210> some

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
shell but I guess there was some

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.180 
shell but I guess there was some
licensing<00:00:39.960> issues<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.649> didn't<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
licensing issues so they didn't do it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.250 
licensing issues so they didn't do it
but<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> came<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.870> around<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> same

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but you know it came out around the same

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
but you know it came out around the same
time<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.460> call<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
time so I can't really call it a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.200 
time so I can't really call it a
coincidence<00:00:45.200> let's<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.320> over<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> features

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
coincidence let's go over the features

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
coincidence let's go over the features
you<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> buttons<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.170> state<00:00:49.500> on

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you have all the buttons on the state on

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.380 
you have all the buttons on the state on
the<00:00:49.739> face<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> were

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the face like you would is if you were

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959 
the face like you would is if you were
holding<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> Wii<00:00:51.840> Remote<00:00:52.079> sideways<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
holding the Wii Remote sideways and on

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
holding the Wii Remote sideways and on
the<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.079> probably<00:00:55.469> can't<00:00:55.680> see<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the back or you probably can't see it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
the back or you probably can't see it
but<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> push<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.969> button<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
but if you push down a button and a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
but if you push down a button and a
certain<00:00:58.020> direction<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.980> pushes<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.510> little

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
certain direction it pushes a little

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.560 
certain direction it pushes a little
rubber<00:01:00.870> tab<00:01:01.140> down<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.309> tab<00:01:02.570> pushes

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
rubber tab down here and the tab pushes

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.340 
rubber tab down here and the tab pushes
down<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.290> actual<00:01:04.619> buttons<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> it's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
down on the actual buttons so it's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.109 
down on the actual buttons so it's
basically<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.920> an<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.610> overlay<00:01:08.909> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
basically just an over and overlay it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
basically just an over and overlay it's

other day let me tell you what I think
first<00:01:52.170> I'll<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.470> over<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> then

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
first I'll go over the good and then

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
first I'll go over the good and then
we'll<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> not-so-good

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we'll I'll go over the not-so-good

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.069 
we'll I'll go over the not-so-good
aspects<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> good<00:01:56.520> aspect<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.630> d-pad<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
aspects the good aspect is the d-pad and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
aspects the good aspect is the d-pad and
the<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:58.799> buttons<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.250> much<00:01:59.490> bigger

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the one and two buttons are much bigger

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
the one and two buttons are much bigger
and<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> great<00:02:00.630> considering<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> most

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and this is great considering that most

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.149 
and this is great considering that most
Nintendo<00:02:02.670> style<00:02:03.000> games<00:02:03.270> held<00:02:03.540> sideways

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
Nintendo style games held sideways

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
Nintendo style games held sideways
you<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:05.909> use<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.570> things

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you know just use just use these things

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.020 
you know just use just use these things
everything<00:02:07.200> else<00:02:07.439> not<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.920> much

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
everything else not so much

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420 
everything else not so much
so<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.410> usually<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> button<00:02:12.250> is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so this is usually the a button is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.000 
so this is usually the a button is
usually<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> B<00:02:13.210> button<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.750> here's<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.260> so

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
usually the B button and here's that so

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.930 
usually the B button and here's that so
I<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.760> definitely<00:02:16.420> excited<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.940> now

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
I was definitely excited for this now

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.250 
I was definitely excited for this now
the<00:02:19.000> other<00:02:19.360> thing<00:02:19.570> that's<00:02:19.720> good<00:02:19.870> about<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the other thing that's good about it is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
the other thing that's good about it is
how<00:02:20.530> easy<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.960> flip<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.260> over<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.150> new

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
how easy is you flip it over put the new

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.920 
how easy is you flip it over put the new
remote<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.480> snaps<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.750> no

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
remote in like like this snaps in no

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.890 
remote in like like this snaps in no
problem<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.240> if<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.360> want<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.600> take<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.810> out

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
problem and if you want to take it out

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.980 
problem and if you want to take it out
it's<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.770> as<00:02:33.070> simple<00:02:33.630> there's<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.810> little

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
it's just as simple there's this little

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.220 
it's just as simple there's this little
tab<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> pull<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.480> does<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.110> has

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
tab here you pull what it does is it has

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.990 
tab here you pull what it does is it has
a<00:02:38.290> little<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:39.160> plastic<00:02:39.459> teeth<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.820> lock

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
a little little plastic teeth that lock

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.449 
a little little plastic teeth that lock
into<00:02:40.270> these<00:02:40.480> holes<00:02:40.660> here<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.340> out

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
into these holes here and to get it out

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.460 
into these holes here and to get it out
you<00:02:42.489> pull<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> tab<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.630> lift<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.320> the

you pull on the tab and lift up with the
strap<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:46.480> grant<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.170> bit<00:02:47.260> harder

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
strap now grant it's a little bit harder

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.199 
strap now grant it's a little bit harder
when<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.070> don't<00:02:48.100> have<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.610> Lea<00:02:48.730> remote<00:02:48.940> strap

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
when you don't have the Lea remote strap

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.750 
when you don't have the Lea remote strap
in<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:50.440> too<00:02:50.590> bad<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.640> doesn't

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
in but it's not too bad it doesn't

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.340 
in but it's not too bad it doesn't
really<00:02:52.120> cause<00:02:52.360> I'm<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> short<00:02:52.870> problem<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
really cause I'm a short problem the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.380 
really cause I'm a short problem the
controller<00:02:56.770> itself<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.580> controller<00:02:57.940> show<00:02:58.120> so

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
controller itself the controller show so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.270 
controller itself the controller show so
itself<00:02:58.959> there's<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.560> little<00:02:59.770> bit<00:02:59.890> lightweight

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
itself there's a little bit lightweight

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.479 
itself there's a little bit lightweight
not<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.270> hard<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.600> use<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:03.100> can<00:03:03.160> use<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
not that hard to use and you can use it

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.729 
not that hard to use and you can use it
for<00:03:03.730> pretty<00:03:03.910> much<00:03:03.970> any<00:03:04.300> game<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.570> we<00:03:05.320> hold<00:03:05.590> so

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
for pretty much any game that we hold so

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.520 
for pretty much any game that we hold so
we<00:03:05.860> run<00:03:06.040> out<00:03:06.130> sideways<00:03:07.020> now<00:03:08.020> this<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.350> great

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
we run out sideways now this is great

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
we run out sideways now this is great
idea<00:03:08.830> in<00:03:09.070> theory<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:09.430> let<00:03:09.640> me<00:03:09.700> go<00:03:09.820> over<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.030> bad

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
idea in theory but let me go over to bad

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.920 
idea in theory but let me go over to bad
aspects<00:03:11.700> unfortunately<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> worst

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
aspects unfortunately one of the worst

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.710 
aspects unfortunately one of the worst
aspects<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:15.330> when<00:03:16.330> you're<00:03:16.450> pushing

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
aspects of this is when you're pushing

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.150 
aspects of this is when you're pushing
down<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.140> buttons<00:03:17.410> with<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.650> Wii<00:03:17.890> Remote

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
down on the buttons with the Wii Remote

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.350 
down on the buttons with the Wii Remote
inside<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:20.230> has<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.410> slight<00:03:21.100> bit<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.340> lag<00:03:21.580> like

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
inside it has a slight bit of lag like

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.229 
inside it has a slight bit of lag like
you<00:03:22.540> push<00:03:22.720> down<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:22.930> here<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:24.549> sensor<00:03:24.940> pushes

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
you push down on here the sensor pushes

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.509 
you push down on here the sensor pushes
down<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.750> button<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:27.070> takes<00:03:27.430> a

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
down on the button and that takes a

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.250 
down on the button and that takes a
little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.820> extra<00:03:28.090> time<00:03:28.330> not<00:03:28.660> much<00:03:28.930> but

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
little bit extra time not much but

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.690 
little bit extra time not much but
enough<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.769> make<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:30.010> noticeable<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
enough to make it noticeable and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.229 
enough to make it noticeable and
old-school<00:03:30.940> games<00:03:31.330> like<00:03:31.799> Mario<00:03:32.799> now<00:03:33.700> for

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
old-school games like Mario now for

those of you who have played Nintendo
style<00:03:35.769> games<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.670> know<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> lot<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.299> them

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
style games you know that a lot of them

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.880 
style games you know that a lot of them
are<00:03:37.630> cave<00:03:38.170> style<00:03:38.470> ports<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:40.650> precision<00:03:41.650> and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
are cave style ports so precision and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.160 
are cave style ports so precision and
timing<00:03:42.130> are<00:03:42.400> key<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.880> almost<00:03:43.630> everything<00:03:43.930> in

like<00:05:28.599> it<00:05:28.810> and<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.440> think<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> idea<00:05:29.919> itself<00:05:30.370> is

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
like it and I think the idea itself is

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.019 
like it and I think the idea itself is
great<00:05:30.729> however<00:05:31.419> uh<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.520> fact<00:05:33.759> that<00:05:33.909> it's

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
great however uh just the fact that it's

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.490 
great however uh just the fact that it's
an<00:05:34.120> overlay<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.719> you<00:05:34.779> have<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.960> push<00:05:35.110> down<00:05:35.139> the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
an overlay and you have to push down the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.659 
an overlay and you have to push down the
button<00:05:35.529> this<00:05:35.830> kind<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.069> ruins<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.430> for<00:05:36.490> me

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
button this kind of ruins it for me

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.649 
button this kind of ruins it for me
everything<00:05:37.599> else<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:37.990> can<00:05:38.139> deal<00:05:38.319> with<00:05:38.349> but<00:05:38.830> uh<00:05:38.860> I

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
everything else I can deal with but uh I

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.909 
everything else I can deal with but uh I

to be well I'm not going to give it an
actual<00:05:47.319> score<00:05:47.800> simply<00:05:48.430> because<00:05:48.729> I'm<00:05:49.060> uh<00:05:49.469> like

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
I said before this is very objective if

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.950 
I said before this is very objective if
I<00:05:52.900> did<00:05:53.080> say<00:05:53.229> it<00:05:53.319> before<00:05:54.300> it's<00:05:55.300> very<00:05:55.479> objective

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
I did say it before it's very objective

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.399 
I did say it before it's very objective
my<00:05:56.229> review<00:05:56.590> yeah<00:05:57.479> my<00:05:58.479> opinion<00:05:58.659> may<00:05:59.139> change

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
my review yeah my opinion may change

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.830 
my review yeah my opinion may change
over<00:05:59.560> time<00:05:59.710> in<00:06:00.250> fact<00:06:00.520> it<00:06:00.669> did<00:06:00.849> I<00:06:01.090> did<00:06:01.779> this

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
over time in fact it did I did this

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.930 
over time in fact it did I did this
review<00:06:02.050> earlier<00:06:02.319> where<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:02.800> highly<00:06:03.550> recommend

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
review earlier where I highly recommend

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.420 
review earlier where I highly recommend
this<00:06:04.150> but<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.479> more<00:06:04.629> I<00:06:04.690> used<00:06:04.960> it<00:06:05.139> the<00:06:06.129> less<00:06:06.310> I

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
this but the more I used it the less I

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.269 
this but the more I used it the less I
can<00:06:06.550> recommend<00:06:06.819> it<00:06:07.090> simply<00:06:07.389> because<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:08.279> the

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
can recommend it simply because of the

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.480 
can recommend it simply because of the
delay<00:06:09.870> however<00:06:10.870> they<00:06:11.289> do<00:06:11.949> you<00:06:12.009> may<00:06:12.190> not<00:06:12.370> be

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
delay however they do you may not be

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.309 
delay however they do you may not be
bothered<00:06:12.849> by<00:06:12.969> this<00:06:13.029> it<00:06:13.449> might<00:06:13.659> be<00:06:13.779> fine<00:06:14.110> for

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
bothered by this it might be fine for

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.769 
bothered by this it might be fine for
you<00:06:14.440> and<00:06:14.819> I<00:06:15.819> would<00:06:16.210> definitely<00:06:16.629> recommend

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.430 
button or the minus button or the home
button<00:06:46.270> so<00:06:48.300> overall<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:49.510> would<00:06:49.630> say<00:06:49.840> it's<00:06:50.350> a

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
button so overall I would say it's a

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.350 
button so overall I would say it's a
decent<00:06:50.770> product<00:06:50.950> and<00:06:51.310> it's<00:06:51.880> not<00:06:52.150> for

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
decent product and it's not for

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.800 
decent product and it's not for
everybody

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
