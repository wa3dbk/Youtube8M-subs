you can run by this doorway the better

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
you can run by this doorway the better
because<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.070> enemy<00:02:05.369> will<00:02:05.549> probably<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.299> all

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
because the enemy will probably be all

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.100

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
over the doorway watching it like a hawk
after<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.200> throw<00:02:10.530> run<00:02:11.129> around<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> flank<00:02:11.910> the

this<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.629> hard<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.959> pull<00:02:15.140> off<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:15.769> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
this is hard to pull off but with a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.680 
this is hard to pull off but with a
little<00:02:15.980> luck<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.459> some<00:02:16.700> great<00:02:17.030> aim<00:02:17.269> you'll

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
little luck and some great aim you'll

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.900 
little luck and some great aim you'll
take<00:02:17.959> B<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.410> now<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.860> spawn<00:02:19.160> trap<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.640> sea

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
take B and now you can spawn trap at sea

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.270 
take B and now you can spawn trap at sea
so<00:02:20.900> let's<00:02:21.110> see<00:02:21.290> how<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.500> hell<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.800> managed<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.509 
so let's see how the hell I managed to
pull<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:22.670> one<00:02:22.879> off<00:02:23.110> except<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.349> guy

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
pull this one off except for this guy

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.339 
pull this one off except for this guy
