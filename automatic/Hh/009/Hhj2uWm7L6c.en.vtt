00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello now let 's see the friend lisi i 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.990
 main characters to deepen 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.580
 this topic and to do tests like 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.460
 always worthing description i put the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.219
 link to glee with easy what not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 agricultural if it is also called via di 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.689
 meyer offender or and mail and it is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.840
 precisely very important metabolic pathway 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 and very important because in some 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.429
 cells for example some plants or 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
 in some there in some cells for 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.260
 example of mammals such as 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
 the companies of uite or at the level of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.450
 central nervous system or 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.790
 even in some microorganisms 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 agricultural aerobics represents the way 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.140
 main through which is obtained 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 energy therefore represents just one 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.969
 of the main metabolism pathways e 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 is taken always remembered in 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.469
 consideration is that I would study 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 biochemistry is always taken as a basis 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.699
 to understand all my chemistry and it is the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 just the prototype via ca ta 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.530
 monica because a street has live music 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 with easy remember and if you didn't have videos 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 on metabolism and deaf university that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.400
 they look because it helps you understand this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 concept she and recurrent metabolic yes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.189
 divide the streets in Naples into two 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 frigates pollica 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.259
 therefore the metabolism is divided into two 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.189
 a street that is precisely that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 leads to oxidation and which provides 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.049
 energy and an anabolic start instead 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 brings the synthesis of molecules and that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.770
 instead it requires energy to take place 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.970
 so this is the characteristic 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.860
 main 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 the acli with isee does not happen again monica 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 because it supplies energy is in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.729
 this what happens in this one 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 sons to remember this concept 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.700
 fundamental 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.880
 glucose is practically broken down into 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.650
 two molecules of private and will bring 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.080
 formation of molecules of archippe i 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.369
 and of reduced nada 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.340
 remember the great reduced the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.830
 electron transporter that has 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 precisely to the function of gathering 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.920
 the energy that occurs during the streets 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.560
 kata monica and glycolysis so you have to 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.050
 remember brings the formation of two 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.770
 pilu molecules I go to a molecule of 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.080
 glucose 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.510
 if you notice glucose to itself molecules of 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.980
 carbon because it is called bilico lisi 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.320
 precisely because this love with axis 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.350
 carbon atoms are cut in two 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.000
 both lysis and more molecules are obtained 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 of pyruvate which are three atoms of 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.989
 carbon 9 some are called their own 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.060
 so for this reason why lysis 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.920
 of the busi group with things is split 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.440
 in two molecules then the atoms axis of 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.470
 carbon two moleculars are obtained 3 a 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 2 to three carbon atoms two of the six 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 this is a feature they are 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.830
 twenty years that you must remember of your friend 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.600
 lithio the crisis as you can see here 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
 occurs in the absence of oxygen 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.910
 what does this mean that the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.310
 glycolysis is an anaerobic way ie 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.989
 just because oxidation does n't either 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 what comes in the absence of oxygen 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.670
 this fact makes some take it 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.920
 also named fermentation what is the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.290
 fermentation the fermentation is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 essentially a toothbrush absence of 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.520
 oxygen 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.170
 in the absence of oxygen, however, which is the 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.920
 main problem that you get little 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.810
 power 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.730
 however, when the situation was at the end 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.360
 in the presence of oxygen the energy 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.160
 obtained is very much for this reason 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.960
 precisely the main feature 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.390
 to remember is to create icons you provide 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.430
 a little bit of energy 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.440
 but thanks to the formation of these 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.300
 two free molecules made that will enter 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 an energy will be produced in the club cycle 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.310
 therefore enormous concepts to remember 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.410
 on the skilful what these are 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.720
 alcoholism via ca ta monica in which 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.180
 glucose is broken down into two molecules of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.830
 pyruvate precisely glucose comes 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.720
 converted into these two molecules and by 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.790
 which just take it away lise 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.920
 therefore it occurs in the absence of oxygen 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.750
 we have no fermentation and are formed 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.680
 two molecules of atp and two molecules of 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.600
 nando reduced 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.980
 always remember that the crisis brings a 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.900
 little energy most 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.239
 energy is concentrated on these two 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.890
 molecules entering the grace cycle 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.600
 and I now have some features on the 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.730
 assumes in finer terms we say but always 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.640
 however general technical ones already 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.769
 it takes place in ten stages and takes place where 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.660
 he is practically black on the why 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.220
 occurs in the cycle because the enzymes do 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.200
 find inside 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.940
 this is a feature to remember 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.890
 because evening the texts ask where 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.720
 occurs between glycolysis where it occurs 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.280
 cycle of agricultural clubs if it happens in the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.860
 home cycle center comes in 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.509
 mitochondria therefore bears this in mind 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.710
 therefore the glycolysis occurs in ten 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.090
 however, stages are often used 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.099
 divide into two main stages the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.310
 preparatory phase the recovery phase 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.969
 the preparatory phase is characterized by 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.189
 what 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.319
 for the use of two molecules the acts 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.039
 b then two molecules are spent i 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:58.120
 atp to be able to start the tap e 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.889
 subsequently it passes to three phases 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.659
 five other phases in which practically 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.639
 there is the recovery phase that is where yes 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.650
 recovers energy then concern yourself 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.199
 this is one of the coolest moments 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.800
 metabolic that occurs in ten stages e 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.900
 they are divided into the preparatory phase where 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.669
 you use energy then turn off atp 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.919
 and a recovery phase where yes 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.930
 regains what one has spent 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.900
 important thing to remember throughout the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.029
 biochemistry and the concept of stage 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.039
 metabolic because it is important because if 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.020
 we had to transform the group or into 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.330
 pyruvate in a single relationship 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.039
 practically we will explore and not 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.979
 we could accumulate energy that would have 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.690
 a sort of combustion therefore the 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.460
 main features to remember 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.379
 chemistry is that our body 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.210
 the age for the more actions 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.300
 this happens to be able to cure 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.279
 energy and precisely for you cannot have 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.529
 reactions too abrupt so this is 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.710
 the basic feature of the whole 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.750
 biochemistry 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.030
 so the Graubünden works in this 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.460
 so in a first stage they are used 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.290
 two molecules of atp and no stage 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.410
 subsequent recovery are recovered from 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.690
 every molecule 3 a Sunday arbonia 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.330
 initial if therefore to see is called 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.670
 gleacher to the gods three phosphates 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.060
 they get love of gold atp on each side 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:16.250
 then 2 plus 2 4 a molecule of another 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.200
 reduced for part so there are two from 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.570
 this what derives derives that if me 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.490
 for example used two molecules of 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.400
 atp at the beginning my expenses are mine 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.800
 gained two other qua two precisely 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.180
 minus 2 is equal to zero so what 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.340
 means this plan to finish it 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.350
 gained essentially two molecules a 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.210
 both molecules of reduced lands 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.930
 so this is precisely one 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.950
 general characteristic to remember is 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.720
 fundamental for useful as you know 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.480
 at the beginning all the important stages that 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.430
 you focus on these basic concepts e 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.000
 a fundamental way happens in absence 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.830
 of oxygen carries the formulation 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.870
 precisely of noise with the atp and of 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.550
 Monday not everything and above all i 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.020
 remember that the group if it is split into 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.840
 these two private molecules that 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.830
 enter the club cycle in presence 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.600
 of oxygen 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.150
 if he is not there he will take advantage of the 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.770
 war but with lactic fermentation and yes 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.210
 for example, lactic acid is less 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.270
 this is a concept that we will deepen 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.830
 after then also like first of all 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.390
 always following the liked to put me 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.770
 like it 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.900

 Hello
