here it's a small bowl at the moment but

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.219 
here it's a small bowl at the moment but
then<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.290> let<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.740> take<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.820> top

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
then we let me actually take off the top

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
then we let me actually take off the top
underneath<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.330> small<00:01:21.720> sticky

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
underneath you have a small sticky

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.810 
underneath you have a small sticky
surface<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> few<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> pack

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
surface which there a few of in the pack

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 
surface which there a few of in the pack
to<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.720> replace<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.560> actually

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to actually replace and this actually

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
to actually replace and this actually
helps<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.189> attach<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.640> diverse<00:01:27.000> different

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
helps you attach a diverse different

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.350 
helps you attach a diverse different
objects<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.610> instance<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> actually

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
objects so for instance if you actually

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.600 
objects so for instance if you actually
listen<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> without<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.650> attachment<00:01:32.369> all

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.510 

you<00:01:35.610> may<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.909> able<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> hear<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.659> maybe<00:01:37.229> not

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
you may be able to hear that maybe not

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.550 
you may be able to hear that maybe not
and<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.479> attach<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> surface<00:01:40.409> such

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and then we attach it to a surface such

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.620 
and then we attach it to a surface such
as<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.829> table

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.340 

you<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.470> suddenly<00:01:44.650> start<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.130> hear<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.520> sound

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you can suddenly start to hear the sound

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.500 
you can suddenly start to hear the sound
as<00:01:47.350> it's<00:01:47.680> using<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.220> title<00:01:48.580> itself<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
as it's using the title itself of the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.590 
as it's using the title itself of the
speaker<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.340> we'll<00:01:54.430> test<00:01:54.640> out<00:01:54.880> an<00:01:55.450> object

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
speaker so and we'll test out an object

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.310 
speaker so and we'll test out an object
such<00:01:56.170> as<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:58.060> big<00:01:58.270> plastic<00:01:58.479> box<00:01:59.760> again

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
such as this big plastic box again

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.999 
such as this big plastic box again
attaching<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.470> box<00:02:02.920> itself<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.830> get<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
attaching it to box itself and you get a

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.220 
attaching it to box itself and you get a
deeper<00:02:09.399> sound<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:11.020> using

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
deeper sound because it's using

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.260 
deeper sound because it's using
somewhere<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.980> contain<00:02:12.280> itself<00:02:12.610> as<00:02:12.880> kind<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
somewhere to contain itself as kind of a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.510 
somewhere to contain itself as kind of a
base<00:02:13.420> speaker

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560 

again<00:02:18.520> we'll<00:02:18.700> move<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.210> different

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
again we'll move on to the different

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.080 
again we'll move on to the different
objects<00:02:20.020> one<00:02:20.500> slightly<00:02:20.950> smaller<00:02:21.250> let's

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
objects one slightly smaller let's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.170 
objects one slightly smaller let's
replace<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:24.520> you've<00:02:24.760> got<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> small

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
replace that now you've got a small

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.640 
replace that now you've got a small
