00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
next up we have the Victorinox tinkerer

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.090 
next up we have the Victorinox tinkerer
this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.689> one<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.929> my<00:00:04.049> all-time<00:00:04.259> favorites

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
this is one of my all-time favorites

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.610 
this is one of my all-time favorites
it's<00:00:06.060> just<00:00:06.330> like<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.600> Spartan<00:00:07.080> which<00:00:07.410> i<00:00:07.560> think

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
it's just like the Spartan which i think

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.040 
it's just like the Spartan which i think
is<00:00:07.890> even<00:00:08.189> more<00:00:08.340> popular<00:00:08.550> but<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.300> find<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is even more popular but I find the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.220 
is even more popular but I find the
number<00:00:10.290> two<00:00:10.440> Phillips<00:00:10.830> more<00:00:11.099> useful<00:00:11.700> than<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
number two Phillips more useful than the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.310 
number two Phillips more useful than the
corkscrew<00:00:14.870> now<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> nice<00:00:16.289> things

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
corkscrew now one of the nice things

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.230 
corkscrew now one of the nice things
about<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.220> only<00:00:17.369> two<00:00:17.609> layers<00:00:17.820> thick

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
about this it's only two layers thick

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
about this it's only two layers thick
it's<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.140> got<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.470> layers<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> tools<00:00:20.130> here

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it's just got two layers of tools here

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.759 
it's just got two layers of tools here
so<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.900> carries<00:00:22.289> well<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
my luck and carry the super tinkerer
sometimes<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> hate<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> give<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
sometimes because I hate to give up the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
sometimes because I hate to give up the
scissors<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.270> noticeably<00:00:33.930> thicker<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

the pocket than the taker so the way I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.790 
the pocket than the taker so the way I
used<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> reason<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.000> keep<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.800> keep

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the spare blade super sharp then I can

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.920 
the spare blade super sharp then I can
make<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.440> without<00:00:43.559> tweezers<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:44.809> one<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> my

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
make do without tweezers right one of my

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
make do without tweezers right one of my
typical<00:00:46.260> mods<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.920> took<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> split<00:00:47.969> ring<00:00:48.000> off

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
typical mods I took the split ring off

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
typical mods I took the split ring off
of<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.039> ground<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> nub<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of here and ground down the nub so it's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.790 
of here and ground down the nub so it's
nice<00:00:51.270> has<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> nice<00:00:51.780> smooth<00:00:52.079> profile<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.710> the

here I this one has some memories I was
stripping<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> wire<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> turned<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
stripping a wire and it turned out the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
stripping a wire and it turned out the
wire<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.260> still<00:01:04.500> live<00:01:04.880> completed<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
wire was still live completed the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.160 
wire was still live completed the
circuit<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:06.810> part<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
circuit with some other part of the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
circuit with some other part of the
knife<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> did<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.159> amateur<00:01:08.310> welding<00:01:08.939> here

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.499 
something so you can't turn it with the
t-handle<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> bring<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
t-handle then you can kind of bring this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
t-handle then you can kind of bring this
into<00:02:00.750> emergency<00:02:01.229> service<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.040> that'll<00:02:02.280> fit

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
into emergency service and that'll fit

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
into emergency service and that'll fit
into<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.729> number<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.210> Phillips<00:02:03.600> head<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:04.560> well

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
into a number two Phillips head as well

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
into a number two Phillips head as well
as<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> small<00:02:05.549> split<00:02:05.909> flathead<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> was

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
as the small split flathead it was

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.859 
as the small split flathead it was
intended<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.420> about<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
intended for and that's about it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
intended for and that's about it
two<00:02:10.379> layers<00:02:10.619> well<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> guess<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.310> should<00:02:11.489> point

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
two layers well I guess I should point

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670 
two layers well I guess I should point
out<00:02:11.790> number<00:02:12.569> two<00:02:12.720> Phillips

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
out number two Phillips

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280 
out number two Phillips
I<00:02:13.769> had<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> tinker<00:02:14.489> back<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> late<00:02:15.329> 80s<00:02:15.719> it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
I had a tinker back in the late 80s it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.199 
I had a tinker back in the late 80s it
was<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.530> smaller<00:02:16.920> size<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.549> think<00:02:17.609> 84

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
was a smaller size I think 84

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.979 
was a smaller size I think 84
millimeters<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:21.209> number<00:02:21.450> two<00:02:21.599> Phillips

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
millimeters and the number two Phillips

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.750 
millimeters and the number two Phillips
was<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.409> of<00:02:22.500> profiled<00:02:23.189> so<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.609> was<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
was kind of profiled so that it was a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
was kind of profiled so that it was a
continuation<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.719> handle<00:02:25.109> instead<00:02:25.349> of

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
continuation of the handle instead of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.399 
continuation of the handle instead of
being<00:02:25.739> round<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.519> one<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.359> it<00:02:27.480> also<00:02:27.629> it

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
being round like this one and it also it

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.259 
being round like this one and it also it
was<00:02:28.560> split<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.219> middle<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.939> they

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
was split in the middle here and they

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.970 
was split in the middle here and they
called<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.689> canned<00:02:30.959> key<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.469> for<00:02:31.650> opening

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
called it a canned key like for opening

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.300 
called it a canned key like for opening
sardine<00:02:32.430> cans<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.389> was<00:02:33.540> pretty<00:02:33.719> interesting

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
sardine cans it was pretty interesting

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.160 
sardine cans it was pretty interesting

noticed<00:02:59.790> they<00:02:59.909> started<00:03:00.239> making<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.689> in<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
noticed they started making it in a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.679 
noticed they started making it in a
smaller<00:03:01.230> size<00:03:01.560> that's<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.909> you

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
smaller size that's the one to get you

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.390 
smaller size that's the one to get you
want<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.409> smaller<00:03:04.769> size<00:03:04.889> makes

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
want to get that that smaller size makes

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000 
want to get that that smaller size makes
it<00:03:05.519> even<00:03:05.669> more<00:03:06.079> comfortable<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.469> the<00:03:07.530> pocket<00:03:07.919> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
it even more comfortable in the pocket I

don't know if you can see here but it's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.759 
don't know if you can see here but it's
just<00:03:10.109> a<00:03:10.230> little<00:03:10.379> shorter<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:12.530> makes<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.680> more

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
just a little shorter and makes it more

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
perspective on this is not making it you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
perspective on this is not making it you
need<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.109> show<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.349> difference<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.909> line

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
need to show that difference if I line

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.189 
need to show that difference if I line
up<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.510> backs<00:03:21.810> here<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:24.239> extra<00:03:24.659> little<00:03:24.810> area

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
up the backs here that extra little area

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:31.219 
up the backs here that extra little area
there<00:03:25.379> makes<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:26.959> easier<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:27.989> carry<00:03:30.229> alright
