00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 that was actually thought 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.110
 harmonious I should be there 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.759
 we should be united 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.559
 who in any case is mine 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.179
 family basically not 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.529
 So do not claim that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.529
 Christmas at our house shit 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.470
 but we always have one 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 do not think back to Christmas Eve 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.710
 went the same way as you look at it 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 would have liked 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 Of course that's just my version of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.359
 Things are the only true thing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.009
 that was pretty much that christmas 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.530
 as zivi came out I'm mine 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.270
 always got mine and not now 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.040
 so thankful that my aunt is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 apparently felt called to today 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 to sweeten the whole family as christmas 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.739
 that would be to like this great 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 probably to one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.649
 probability of 100% that 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.480
 Christmas is different 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 Apparently she thought it was great 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.840
 If everyone was one of the most beautiful 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190
 and I repeat the most beautiful 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.140
 christmas songs compilation of all hast 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 you can have a singer and as if 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.629
 she would have been dissuaded 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.920
 So can Eat the dinner cooks 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.630
 he is going 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 it was a bit like cinnamon in the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.400
 air and the Christmas tree shone 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.070
 in perceived three billion colors with 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 his felt three billion 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.460
 christmas balls where by the way my 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.380
 down again instead of water right 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 harmonious world now probably with 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.460
 security still say yes and so 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 a bit of music would have been great though 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 good that keep aunt and such a nice one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.740
 Christmas time given him well on 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 At the beginning we were not so 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 shit even if I do not now 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.250
 but this church music is absolutely there 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.820
 believe me on this CD were 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 one hundred percent any 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.409
 hidden messages that appeal to you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.899
 a subconscious crawl and become 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.439
 to push to complete it completely 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.270
 we turn over embassy dance or 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.310
 the point extra but suddenly tips 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.390
 you have to change the mood drastically 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 Still say it is one of the few 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.450
 Christmas is where we dad mom 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.799
 and I celebrated alone 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.299
 sometime timmermann loudly on it 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.439
 The music finally passed 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.149
 should be made 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.159
 Well what in the end s.einem huge 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.890
 zoff is finished between the three of us because 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.030
 only have the peace key commands 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.950
 really the end of the song was that he 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.330
 those from which his room went 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.590
 So of course I have a bi again 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.510
 actually taken along 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.680
 a mega sad story but wants 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.700
 from today in the trade sample 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.500
 that is such a story again 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.730
 tells a bigger meeting 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.110
 or if i like one 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 complains that a christmas swiss 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.160
 was absolute evergreen and one hundred 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.170
 By the way, percent was on this one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.209
 Ask my aunt for this wonderful 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 cd by the way almost no from the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.470
 Maybe she could have suffered a family 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.700
 sometimes so experienced similar situations 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.590
 schweini comment 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.390
 responsibility some video and mine 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.739
 Wonderful fetches I've had 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.459
 emphatically and I hope we see 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.459
