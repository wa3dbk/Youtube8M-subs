reason<00:00:21.539> I've<00:00:22.500> never<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.039> problem<00:00:23.250> but

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
reason I've never had this problem but

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.570 
reason I've never had this problem but
the<00:00:24.779> paint<00:00:25.220> crackled<00:00:27.080> for<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.289> reason<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the paint crackled for some reason and I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.410 
the paint crackled for some reason and I
was<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.420> strip<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.199> repaint<00:00:31.800> it

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
was going to strip it and repaint it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
was going to strip it and repaint it
then<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.600> figured<00:00:33.930> since<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
then I figured since it did it to the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.819 
then I figured since it did it to the
entire<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.360> decided<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.989> leave<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> look

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
entire thing I decided to leave it look

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.790 
entire thing I decided to leave it look
different<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:39.140> guess<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.649> an

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
different I guess it was kind of an

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
different I guess it was kind of an
accidental<00:00:41.309> mistake<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:45.140> here's
