Air Force One lows on feet with a pair
of<00:04:19.920> shorts<00:04:20.370> one<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.359> laces<00:04:21.660> tied<00:04:21.900> one<00:04:22.109> with

of shorts one the laces tied one with
the<00:04:22.320> laces<00:04:22.650> untied<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.790> prefer<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
the laces untied I think I prefer the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.070 
the laces untied I think I prefer the
look<00:04:24.479> of

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
look of

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.200

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
having untied laces on these shoes but

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.730 
having untied laces on these shoes but
they<00:04:27.330> don't<00:04:27.479> really<00:04:27.569> fit<00:04:27.930> right<00:04:28.169> with<00:04:28.349> untied

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
they don't really fit right with untied

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.439 
they don't really fit right with untied
laces<00:04:29.159> so<00:04:29.340> you're<00:04:29.819> probably<00:04:29.940> gonna<00:04:30.210> wear

Untied<00:05:25.379> better<00:05:26.310> than<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.610> tied<00:05:26.819> version<00:05:27.210> but

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
Untied better than the tied version but

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.879 
Untied better than the tied version but
again<00:05:27.750> that<00:05:27.930> sounds<00:05:28.080> personal<00:05:28.379> preference

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
again that sounds personal preference

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:29.959 
again that sounds personal preference
and<00:05:29.069> however<00:05:29.219> you<00:05:29.370> want<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.639> wear<00:05:29.729> your<00:05:29.940> shoes

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.670 
and however you want to wear your shoes

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
that's pretty much it as far as what

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.290 
that's pretty much it as far as what
they<00:05:31.800> look<00:05:31.949> like<00:05:31.979> with<00:05:32.340> pair<00:05:32.580> of<00:05:32.639> pants<00:05:32.819> on<00:05:33.029> and

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
they look like with pair of pants on and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.779
