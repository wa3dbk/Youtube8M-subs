 turn of events even ra 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.350
 given that the script was not the most 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.390
 Forte series is still too early 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.099
 say whether it will benefit or

 use them at first convenient 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.390
 opportunities we hope that the time 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.730
 to optimize the engine was enough 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 and the famous drag race is over 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.319
 the changes affected the plot 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.209
 he became somewhat darker and more serious not 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.920
 our adventurer had time to move away from 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.239
 things sit down as his life breaks 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.370
 elder brother sam 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.290
 considered dead along with them 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.840
 go to the next quest to search 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.819
 treasure and eat. it will not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.099
 from the lungs as the developers themselves said 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.170
 in this trial, nathan will face 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.329
 many difficult decisions and in the end 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 he will have to sacrifice a lot 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.959
 salvation close in all this 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 felt the hand of the creators of the last of 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.540
 ace 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.849
 means moral choice and its influence on 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.160
 the plot is not an empty sound anyway 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.209
 on waiting for a rethinking of the storyline and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 characters of heroes 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.859
 which at least sounds intriguingly the same 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.569
 who decides to go through the game in the original 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.819
 voice acting harvested another nice 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.130
 surprise in the role of the most troy 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.870
 baker whose voice speaks booker 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.030
 davitt in bioshock and joker batman 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.400
 Origins peygan minutes whether he and many 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.500
 others drake himself invited to voice 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.120
 then at the stage of the century more famous for its 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.220
 roles in movies and television series 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.900
 however, he dropped out of the project after them 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.239
 Hanning but music 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.220
 exactly will henry jackman 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.170
 already noted work on films 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.569
 X-Men First Class Captain America and 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.010
 the city of heroes so in this plan is worth 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.980
 expect really high quality 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.299
 work as a result, they promise much 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.130
 reworked game in which studio 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.849
 developer and publisher and invested a lot 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.190
 effort 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.019

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.639
 new chapter in history opening 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.980
 wide open spaces for later 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.690
 continuation and final point if 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.370
 we once again did not disappoint the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.650
 amazing hours spent on 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.690
 African continent guaranteed to us 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.820
 and let's set aside doubts and 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.100
 they just wait for the good the game is announced 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.930
