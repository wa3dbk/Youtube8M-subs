the property they have leveled this is
the<00:00:45.420> top<00:00:45.660> level<00:00:46.079> oh<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:47.129> guess<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.910> top

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the top level oh I guess this is the top

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
the top level oh I guess this is the top
level<00:00:49.850> inside<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> building<00:00:51.300> right<00:00:51.510> there

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
level inside that building right there

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.950 
level inside that building right there

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
these tools here that me ended down

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
these tools here that me ended down
property<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.260> great<00:01:01.949> pergolas

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
property so and these great pergolas

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.540 
property so and these great pergolas
here<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.589> chairs<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.949> lie<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.000 

and<00:01:08.820> we're<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.690> along<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> cliffs<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and we're all along the cliffs here so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
and we're all along the cliffs here so
the<00:01:11.160> drop<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> pretty<00:01:11.910> steep<00:01:12.240> I'd<00:01:12.660> say<00:01:12.900> about

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the drop is pretty steep I'd say about

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.270 
the drop is pretty steep I'd say about
30<00:01:13.410> feet<00:01:14.990> maybe<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.320> better<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.890> very

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
30 feet maybe a little better and very

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
30 feet maybe a little better and very
jagged<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> don't<00:01:20.160> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> fall<00:01:20.580> off<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
jagged so you don't want to fall off the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.590 
jagged so you don't want to fall off the
cliff<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.930> never<00:01:22.620> be<00:01:22.860> seen<00:01:23.100> again<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.520> sure

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.210 

and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.050> where<00:01:28.560> those<00:01:28.770> people<00:01:29.010> are

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and I think where those people are

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.130 
and I think where those people are
coming<00:01:29.520> from<00:01:29.550> across<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
coming from across is probably where the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.370 
coming from across is probably where the
beaches<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.770> we're<00:01:31.950> gonna<00:01:32.240> take<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> path<00:01:33.660> I

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.800 

guess<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.620> down<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.570> there's<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
guess go down and back up and there's a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.340 
guess go down and back up and there's a
lot<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.080> going<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.340> again<00:01:42.350> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
lot of going down and back up again so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.180 
lot of going down and back up again so
if<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.070> stay<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.810> you'll<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.840> able<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> work

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
if you stay here you'll be able to work

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:57.300 
if you stay here you'll be able to work
off<00:01:47.460> all<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.020> delicious<00:01:49.020> Beijing<00:01:49.470> cooking

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.219 

ok<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:57.970> another<00:01:58.329> staircase<00:01:58.840> down<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.509> can<00:02:01.810> see

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
ok so another staircase down you can see

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.100 
ok so another staircase down you can see
as<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.619> could<00:02:03.250> at<00:02:03.399> Sam<00:02:03.700> Lords<00:02:04.210> how<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.600> rough
