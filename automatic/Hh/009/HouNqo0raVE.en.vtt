00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
pumped this up to 4,000 is oh I think

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
pumped this up to 4,000 is oh I think
this<00:03:35.470> was<00:03:35.650> around<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.100> time<00:03:36.160> where<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:36.610> was

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
this was around the time where I was

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.300 
this was around the time where I was
kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.510> hesitant<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:38.170> really<00:03:38.530> go<00:03:38.680> above<00:03:38.829> a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
kind of hesitant to really go above a

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.550 
kind of hesitant to really go above a
certain<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.820> 0<00:03:40.120> because<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.630> know<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.380> just

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
certain is 0 because I know it just

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.789 
certain is 0 because I know it just
didn't<00:03:41.920> seem<00:03:42.070> natural<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.579> go<00:03:42.730> above<00:03:43.200> 2500<00:03:44.200> but

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
didn't seem natural to go above 2500 but

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.180 
didn't seem natural to go above 2500 but
um<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:46.630> know<00:03:46.750> one<00:03:47.200> 50th<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.769> second<00:03:48.130> is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
um you know one 50th of a second is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.030 
um you know one 50th of a second is
plenty<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.670> time<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:49.180> keep<00:03:49.329> him<00:03:49.620> frozen<00:03:50.620> which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
plenty of time to keep him frozen which

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.250 
plenty of time to keep him frozen which
you<00:03:51.190> can<00:03:51.370> see<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:52.420> keep<00:03:52.810> his<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.110> know<00:03:53.140> his

and I've been seeing this lately and a

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.090 
and I've been seeing this lately and a
lot<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.540> people's<00:04:10.840> work<00:04:11.109> is<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.799> try

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
lot of people's work is that you try

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.650 
lot of people's work is that you try
making<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.730> photo<00:04:12.760> something<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.540> it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
making the photo something that it

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.740 
making the photo something that it
wasn't<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:15.100> if<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.400> was<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> dark<00:04:15.850> seen<00:04:16.209> you

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
wasn't like if it was a dark seen you

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.539 
wasn't like if it was a dark seen you
try<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.019> make<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.200> really<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:17.739> bright<00:04:18.250> and

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
try to make it really really bright and

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.849 
try to make it really really bright and
it's<00:04:19.180> kind<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.419> not<00:04:19.600> representative<00:04:20.349> of<00:04:20.590> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
it's kind of not representative of the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.200 
it's kind of not representative of the
scene<00:04:21.099> but<00:04:21.250> again<00:04:21.549> that's<00:04:21.760> personal

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
scene but again that's personal

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.760 
scene but again that's personal
preference<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.840> try<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.380> keep<00:04:23.500> it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
preference I try to keep it

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.350 
preference I try to keep it
representative<00:04:24.700> as<00:04:24.880> much

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
representative as much

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.140 
representative as much
as<00:04:25.419> possible<00:04:26.169> let's<00:04:27.039> play<00:04:27.250> with<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.520> hsl

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
as possible let's play with that hsl

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.879 
as possible let's play with that hsl
slider<00:04:28.479> in<00:04:28.870> black<00:04:29.379> and<00:04:29.590> white<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.830> is

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
slider in black and white this is

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.379 
slider in black and white this is
something<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.400> couldn't<00:04:30.669> do<00:04:30.879> if<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.180> just

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
something you couldn't do if you just

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.390 
something you couldn't do if you just
took<00:04:31.509> out<00:04:31.689> the<00:04:31.900> color<00:04:32.280> vibrance<00:04:33.280> and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
took out the color vibrance and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.390 
took out the color vibrance and
saturation<00:04:34.319> so<00:04:35.319> we<00:04:35.469> can<00:04:35.620> see<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.370> know

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
saturation so we can see that you know

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.959 
saturation so we can see that you know
that<00:04:37.360> brightens<00:04:37.870> up<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.379> red<00:04:38.710> right<00:04:39.490> here

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
that brightens up this red right here

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.140 
that brightens up this red right here
and<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.539> brightens<00:04:40.930> up<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.530> chair<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:42.879> now<00:04:43.030> we

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
and it brightens up the chair so now we

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.730 
and it brightens up the chair so now we
darken<00:04:43.569> up<00:04:43.719> all<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.169> Reds<00:04:44.379> and<00:04:44.500> look<00:04:44.620> what

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
darken up all the Reds and look what
