that's it two penguins and you go from

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.290 
that's it two penguins and you go from
there<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.110> how<00:01:23.410> do<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:23.590> move<00:01:23.740> well<00:01:24.729> your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
there so how do you move well your

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.660 
there so how do you move well your
penguin<00:01:25.690> can<00:01:25.899> move<00:01:26.110> in<00:01:26.320> any<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.429> six

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
penguin can move in any of the six

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.749 
penguin can move in any of the six
directions<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.539> hexagon<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:30.729> of

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
directions of the hexagon and kind of

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.310 
directions of the hexagon and kind of
like<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.940> queen<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.420> chest<00:01:31.659> he<00:01:31.929> can<00:01:32.080> move<00:01:32.170> as

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
like a queen and chest he can move as

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.169 
like a queen and chest he can move as
far<00:01:32.619> as<00:01:32.770> he<00:01:32.890> wants<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.190> until<00:01:33.759> he<00:01:33.850> encounters

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
far as he wants to until he encounters

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.960 
far as he wants to until he encounters
an<00:01:34.300> obstacle<00:01:34.390> an<00:01:35.009> obstacle<00:01:36.009> could<00:01:36.280> be<00:01:36.520> another

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
an obstacle an obstacle could be another

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.760 
an obstacle an obstacle could be another
player<00:01:37.330> such<00:01:37.960> as<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.200> yellow<00:01:38.380> penguin

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
player such as the yellow penguin

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.399 
player such as the yellow penguin
blocking<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> green<00:01:39.520> penguin<00:01:39.880> or<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:41.200> could

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
blocking the green penguin or it could

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.389 
blocking the green penguin or it could
be<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.740> hole<00:01:42.069> in<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.310> ice<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:45.159> always<00:01:45.340> leave

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
be a hole in the ice you always leave

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.560 
be a hole in the ice you always leave
the<00:01:45.520> straight<00:01:45.759> line<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.119> they<00:01:46.210> can't<00:01:46.450> make

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
the straight line so they can't make

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.749 
the straight line so they can't make
turns<00:01:46.869> so<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.350> navigate<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.920> board<00:01:48.159> you're

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
turns so to navigate the board you're

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.520 
turns so to navigate the board you're
basically<00:01:48.939> moving<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.140> straight<00:01:50.320> line

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
basically moving in straight line

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.170 
basically moving in straight line
segments<00:01:51.040> waiting<00:01:51.610> for<00:01:51.729> your<00:01:51.820> next<00:01:52.030> turn

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
segments waiting for your next turn

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.270 
segments waiting for your next turn
moving<00:01:52.659> again<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.920> why<00:01:54.040> are<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.159> moving

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
moving again so why are you moving

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.249 
moving again so why are you moving
across<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.579> board<00:01:54.939> well<00:01:55.659> you're<00:01:55.869> trying<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
across the board well you're trying to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.190 
across the board well you're trying to
collect<00:01:56.530> fish<00:01:57.390> everyone<00:01:58.390> starts<00:01:58.719> on<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> tile

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
collect fish everyone starts on the tile

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920 
collect fish everyone starts on the tile
featuring<00:01:59.890> just<00:02:00.369> one<00:02:00.610> fish<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.210> you're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
featuring just one fish and you're

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.539 
featuring just one fish and you're
trying<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.170> move<00:02:02.380> two<00:02:02.560> tiles<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.920> have<00:02:03.130> more

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
trying to move two tiles that have more

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.389 
trying to move two tiles that have more
fish<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.149> for<00:02:04.299> example<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:05.560> go<00:02:05.829> here<00:02:06.219> and

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
fish so for example I can go here and

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.830 
fish so for example I can go here and
get<00:02:06.520> three<00:02:06.850> or<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.119> can<00:02:07.299> go<00:02:07.329> all<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.600> way<00:02:07.750> down

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
get three or I can go all the way down

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.680 
get three or I can go all the way down
here<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.590> get<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.280> tile<00:02:09.579> which<00:02:10.119> prevents

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
here and get this tile which prevents

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.319 
here and get this tile which prevents
the<00:02:10.810> blue<00:02:11.019> player<00:02:11.260> from<00:02:11.650> taking<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.329> once

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
the blue player from taking it once

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.310 
the blue player from taking it once
you've<00:02:13.510> moved<00:02:14.430> tile<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.610> occupied<00:02:16.150> comes<00:02:17.140> off

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you've moved tile you occupied comes off

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.440 
you've moved tile you occupied comes off
the<00:02:17.470> board<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.670> put<00:02:18.790> aside<00:02:19.030> until<00:02:19.269> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the board and it's put aside until the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.759 
the board and it's put aside until the
end<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> game<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.320> count<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.620> for

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
end of the game when you count it for
