00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 Y 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.380
 Y 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.330
 my name is Dutch Thongs and I'm here 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.030
 in the community from taree to municipality 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.700
 I think of the yaracuy state and we're going to 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.090
 take the opportunity to prepare 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.070
 a dish that we traditionally make 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.740
 here in the municipality and is named 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.289
 the little one as you can see here 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.949
 are all the ingredients that it carries 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.890
 the important thing is that it remains with a taste 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.410
 that anybody good is going to do it I know 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 that they are going to do in their house we have the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.250
 boiling water 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.500
 while the water boils us 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.300
 let's go here to crush the garlic 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 until completely dissolved 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.730
 we proceed to chop 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.730
 the dressings 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.610
 the paprika first 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.630
 we make strips of paprika 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.799
 new 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.799
 we chop the piece 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.020
 these dishes practically wheat me 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.110
 I would say I learned it from my grandmother my aunt 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.620
 and good and we have not stopped 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.710
 do it so maybe we with that 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.990
 interest and that concern then we started 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.670
 to rescue to rescue all that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.850
 preparation 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.090
 of these traditional dishes that have 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.090
 municipalities 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.950
 camet in the river but also in the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.869
 corners prepare the aguaditas and everything 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.900
 the one who passes by suddenly they sell a cup 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.909
 of water dita and good and is the person who 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.780
 he does his August with his sale 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.780
 also from aguadita 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.600
 here we are biting the in the chives 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.380
 There is also a bit that gives a lot 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.960
 taste to food 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.480
 let's stir a little 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.730
 my grandmother told me never to return 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.640
 things with the tip of a knife not 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.380
 I know why because he never told me why 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.620
 so let's do it with a fork 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.130
 let's pay attention to grandma 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.370
 fork so that the colors and 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.860
 the flavors called a pinch of cumin 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.520
 that they can never miss a lot because 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 cumin can be used a lot 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.230
 and we proceed to place in what is 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.580
 sweet 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.580
 to remove the seeds 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.490
 these dressings are never lacking in the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.069
 communities since we ourselves are going 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.840
 the task of sowing 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:02.220
 the chilli is explained a ski lift 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 the same paprika 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.760
 here are the sweet countries 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.540
 bounce again to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.560
 unnim 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.560
 flavors and smells 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.160
 but a tantico that boils again and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.890
 soften the paste to add the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.900
 sardine meanwhile let's sautÃ© 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.890
 the dressings to have it prepared from a 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.000
 Once subscribed, we are going to add a 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.000
 little oil 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.200
 the community has recently grown but 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.310
 we are talking about a third task 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.980
 since for the year 1450 existed towards what 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.930
 side of the rock the first task there are 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.230
 ruins of the first cathedral that 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.030
 existed in that first would give for that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.580
 then the town was called our 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.560
 session our lady of conception 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.209
 of homework 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.180
 and this would give practically new to this 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.290
 point when the settlers arrived 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.330
 the black water lakes of the hurdles and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.600
 the important thing is that they have a lot 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.600
 culture 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.199
 well I think this is fine we are going to 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:44.160
 see him stand and we proceed to add 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:46.700
 the sardine to the spaghetti but let's 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.050
 crush it a little bit 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.050
 because you have big pieces 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.100
 and well let's throw it to the pasta 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.100
 join them 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.470
 let's wait about 10 minutes to 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.470
 add it then the jalisco 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.950
 and be very happy 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.340
 and a song of salt is needed 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:39.650
 here we are going to place the garlic 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.330
 and a little more salt 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.330
 we try again birds 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.030
 are divine divine let's apply the 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.820
 cilantro that is missing 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.090
 it is placed 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.970
 useful 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.970
 and he never suffered with the dressing 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.159
 well this is ready to eat 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.870
 but accompanied by some tostones that do not 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.870
 they could be missing at the table but 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.660
 we have already finished with the little dish 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.539
 traditional of the municipality but it is 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.610
 from the state yaracuy and good if I 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.539
 allow me I'm going to eat my little bit of 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.539
 water di is ok
