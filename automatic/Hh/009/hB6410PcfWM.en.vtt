optical cable so that you have to buy
Astros<00:02:14.720> or<00:02:14.990> what<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.500> includes<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.160> if<00:02:16.910> you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
Astros or what it includes it but if you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.210 
Astros or what it includes it but if you
were<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:18.050> like<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.710> new<00:02:18.830> mex<00:02:19.010> amp

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
were to get like just the new mex amp

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
were to get like just the new mex amp
you'd<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.700> get<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> toss<00:02:20.090> on<00:02:20.270> cable<00:02:20.600> with<00:02:20.690> I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you'd have to get a toss on cable with I

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.880 
you'd have to get a toss on cable with I
think<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:21.320> why<00:02:21.410> they're<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.740> this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
think that's why they're going to this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.449 
think that's why they're going to this
mp3<00:02:22.250> audio<00:02:23.030> n<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.050> use<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.740> take

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
mp3 audio n I like to use this to take

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.790 
mp3 audio n I like to use this to take
audio<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.270> computer<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.560> plug

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
have these two and they are

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.820 
have these two and they are
automatically<00:04:06.700> included<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.810> whatever<00:04:08.590> I

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
automatically included so whatever I

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.380 
automatically included so whatever I
didn't<00:04:09.040> ever<00:04:09.160> use<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.400> anyway<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:09.940> no<00:04:10.239> big

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
didn't ever use that anyway so no big

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.710 
didn't ever use that anyway so no big
deal<00:04:10.510> but<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:12.069> guess<00:04:12.730> Astro<00:04:13.120> hopefully

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
deal but I guess Astro hopefully

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.720 
deal but I guess Astro hopefully
improved<00:04:14.230> some<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:14.950> qualities<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.519> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
improved some of the qualities of the

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
headset which is why they skimp out on a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.150 
headset which is why they skimp out on a
few<00:04:17.650> other<00:04:17.799> things<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:20.049> if<00:04:20.709> i<00:04:20.889> can<00:04:21.039> get<00:04:21.100> this
