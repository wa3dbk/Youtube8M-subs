looks like the perfect color in the tube
but<00:02:53.850> when<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.150> swatch<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.990> lot<00:02:55.200> darker

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
than this really so I guess so I have to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
than this really so I guess so I have to
mix<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.070> Manic<00:02:59.340> Panic<00:02:59.459> dreamtone
