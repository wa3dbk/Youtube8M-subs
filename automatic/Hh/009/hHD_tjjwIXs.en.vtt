to<00:01:18.310> start<00:01:18.640> by<00:01:18.880> tying<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.539> back<00:01:19.750> two<00:01:20.140> tabs

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
to start by tying the back two tabs

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.850 
to start by tying the back two tabs
these<00:01:20.710> shorter<00:01:21.130> tabs<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:23.350> can<00:01:23.470> just<00:01:23.679> kind

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
these shorter tabs and you can just kind

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.580 
these shorter tabs and you can just kind
of<00:01:23.890> knot<00:01:24.130> them<00:01:24.310> there<00:01:24.610> they're<00:01:25.060> larger<00:01:25.630> tabs

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
of knot them there they're larger tabs

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.910 
of knot them there they're larger tabs
so<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:28.360> pretty<00:01:28.569> easy<00:01:28.719> to<00:01:29.110> unknot<00:01:29.500> them<00:01:29.770> at

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
so it's pretty easy to unknot them at

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.440 
so it's pretty easy to unknot them at
the<00:01:30.039> end<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.399> when<00:01:30.579> you're<00:01:30.729> done<00:01:30.850> with<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.090> just

the end of when you're done with it just

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.090 
the end of when you're done with it just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
because it's such thick material okay

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.120

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
and the reason for that is that we don't

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.170 
and the reason for that is that we don't
want<00:03:44.560> someone<00:03:44.800> tying<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.400> around<00:03:45.490> their<00:03:45.910> neck

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
and strangling themselves by accident so

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.550 
and strangling themselves by accident so
we<00:03:49.030> actually<00:03:49.300> have<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:49.660> tie<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.320> way<00:03:50.440> it

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
we actually have one tie and the way it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.010 
we actually have one tie and the way it
works<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:51.940> kind<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.180> goes<00:03:52.330> around<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
works is it just kind of goes around the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.979
