00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.009
 falls first nail art proposal for 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.140
 super-simple new year as you see 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 looks like zebra but it is not now 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 you'll find out in the tutorial I'm sorry 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.009
 precisely for the tutorial because the first one 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 I did n't record it, I'm sorry 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.859
 as much for or simply applied a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.560
 based on active growth the black color 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 debora su vabbÃ¨ now you see it 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.000
 and while on medium and annular the enamels 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.000
 not the giuseppe di turo graphic 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 silver and what I do then I take 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
 I wait for everything to be perfectly 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.960
 dry after which I take some 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 strips should not be regular 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 and just crawled about sizes 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.590
 different adhesive tape and I do it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.230
 adhere randomly to the nails 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 own fantasy as how it comes to me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.660
 that moment in short and therefore obviously 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.449
 I do it both on the middle and on the ring finger 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.949
 then on the two with the enamel 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 holographic because you see it behind 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.019
 this background and I love al 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.900
 contrast between the enamel does not kill and with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 the holographic light in tension one 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 crazy thing that I know a lot and then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 are colors that really remind me of the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.909
 new year then as first proposal 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 I went on classic colors 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.509
 I take the black color that is there 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 which is applied to the other nails 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 and very simply I go to revise 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
 over the adhesive tape making 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.299
 be careful to cover everyone well 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 the nooks that our cheer leaves 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.140
 uncovered your fingernail because that's where the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.140
 color then will actually stick 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.420
 I help with a small pizza and go to 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:49.649
 remove all here all the strips 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.320
 tine of adhesive tape actually 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.090
 the effect seems almost 10 but it's not one 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 zebra actually is much much more 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.770
 quick easier to recreate because 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.460
 do not have to stall with the brush a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 to do things so I found an idea 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 really easy to make 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.849
 even maybe at the last minute is a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.049
 the only one waiting and waiting for it 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.150
 basic nail polish both perfectly 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.250
 however dry for the rest even for those 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.330
 it does not have a great dexterity comes out 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.709
 a particular thing is nice then you can 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.319
 obviously play with colors that 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.150
 favorite based on the makeup that that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.489
 wall for that evening at the clothing 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.489
 in short, the one you prefer here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.459
 at this point I decided to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 add another strip 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.330
 because it seemed a little too empty there 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.190
 so as you can see you can too 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.060
 this is what the jousting sail is obviously 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.800
 final results 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.720
 I really like her 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.340
 simplicity but to be taken obviously a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.620
 top this coat using those 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.380
 of the lux online hilux wine company 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.390
 and I obviously apply it on all fingers 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.250
 be careful on your fingers decorated with 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 north of passing the top coat too many times 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.580
 because you risk melting the enamel 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 black and drag it away and then 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.269
 ruin everything so better take it 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.049
 a nice drop to drag it with 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.000
 decision however with this is all the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.209
 next week I will upload a tutorial 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 of difficulty a little higher always 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.170
 but for new year's course and of 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.420
 instead I leave you the photos of the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.489
 eco nail art made for christmas and 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.410
 in my opinion, however, changing the colors o 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.030
 in short, by changing something I am 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.769
 usable but also for the rest 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.600
 of the year, however, are ideas 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.940
 apart from the Santa Claus who obviously 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.250
 that one is purely Christmas but 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 however like this really everything there 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.019
 I send a kiss and see you at 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.440
 next 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.440
 Hello
