problem taking over from a
well-established<00:00:58.530> part<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.840> scared<00:01:00.840> about

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
well-established part we scared about

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.009

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
because I thought what they created was

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
because I thought what they created was
television<00:01:06.060> history<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.840> no<00:01:06.990> way

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
television history and there was no way

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.960 
television history and there was no way
as<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.440> actor<00:01:07.800> I<00:01:08.009> would<00:01:08.490> try<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.729> fill

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
as an actor I would try and fill

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
George and seeing if we could create a

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.820 
George and seeing if we could create a
relationship<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:21.959> in<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.530> the
