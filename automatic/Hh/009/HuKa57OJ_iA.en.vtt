falls on stigma from stigma it goes into
style<00:03:04.390> from<00:03:05.260> there<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.950> enters<00:03:06.519> ovary<00:03:07.150> there

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
style from there it enters ovary there

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.130 
style from there it enters ovary there
they're<00:03:08.170> small<00:03:08.500> eggs<00:03:09.090> :<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.269> eggs<00:03:10.540> combine

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
they're small eggs : and eggs combine

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.039 
they're small eggs : and eggs combine
together<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.920> make<00:03:12.130> fruit<00:03:12.430> my<00:03:13.360> teacher<00:03:13.690> told

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
together to make fruit my teacher told

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.550 
together to make fruit my teacher told
me<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.340> called<00:03:15.610> pollination

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
me that this is called pollination

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.949 
me that this is called pollination
correct<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:18.400> pole<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.910> entering<00:03:19.299> ovary<00:03:19.780> is

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
correct this pole in entering ovary is

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.130 
correct this pole in entering ovary is
called<00:03:20.290> pollination<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.250> fruits<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.480> seeds

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
called pollination and fruits and seeds

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.250 
called pollination and fruits and seeds
are<00:03:23.410> made<00:03:23.890> because<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.420> new<00:03:25.810> seeds

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
are made because of this so new seeds

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.880 
are made because of this so new seeds
are<00:03:26.590> made<00:03:26.920> use<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.580> pollination<00:03:28.890> pollination

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
are made use of pollination pollination

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.610 
are made use of pollination pollination
is<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.430> important<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.180> due<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.750> pollination

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
is very important and due to pollination

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.730 
is very important and due to pollination
new<00:03:33.250> seeds<00:03:33.670> are<00:03:33.940> made

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
new seeds are made

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.480 
new seeds are made
and<00:03:34.860> loops<00:03:35.100> I'll<00:03:35.370> come<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> wall<00:03:36.510> Oh<00:03:37.190> see<00:03:38.190> a
