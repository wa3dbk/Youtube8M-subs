00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
wall oh this is just crazy this is

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.009 
wall oh this is just crazy this is
actually<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.190> fifth<00:03:47.519> battle<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.269> just

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
actually the fifth battle I just

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.390 
actually the fifth battle I just
purchased<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.470> tank<00:03:49.680> but<00:03:49.829> this<00:03:49.949> is<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.159> fifth

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
purchased the tank but this is the fifth

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.550 
purchased the tank but this is the fifth
battle<00:03:50.699> in<00:03:50.819> this<00:03:50.940> tank<00:03:51.150> I've<00:03:51.599> got<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:52.019> m103

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
battle in this tank I've got my m103

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.369 
battle in this tank I've got my m103
crew<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.629> minus<00:03:54.629> one<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.109> Gunners

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
crew in here minus one of the Gunners

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.409 
crew in here minus one of the Gunners
because<00:03:55.739> they<00:03:56.280> don't<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.760> radio<00:03:57.180> operator

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
because they don't have a radio operator

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.110 
because they don't have a radio operator
us<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.319> guess<00:03:58.400> anyway<00:03:59.400> trying<00:03:59.699> to<00:03:59.760> take<00:03:59.879> chops

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
us I guess anyway trying to take chops

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.210 
us I guess anyway trying to take chops
on<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.299> kv-1<00:04:00.810> these<00:04:01.049> sides<00:04:01.349> penetration

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
on the kv-1 these sides penetration

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.190 
on the kv-1 these sides penetration
indicator<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.729> red

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
indicator is red

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.170 
indicator is red
and<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.220> didn't<00:04:05.430> look<00:04:05.520> like<00:04:05.580> I<00:04:05.879> was<00:04:05.910> gonna

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
and so it didn't look like I was gonna

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.390 
and so it didn't look like I was gonna
be<00:04:06.360> able<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.540> depend<00:04:06.840> anything<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.680> indicated

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
be able to depend anything is indicated

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.880 
be able to depend anything is indicated
by<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.790> shot<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.120> took<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.690> get<00:04:09.870> hit<00:04:10.080> he<00:04:10.620> said

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
by that shot I took and get hit he said

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.699 
by that shot I took and get hit he said
it<00:04:11.040> did<00:04:11.190> not<00:04:11.220> penetrate<00:04:11.519> anyway<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.379> three

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
it did not penetrate anyway it is three

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.290 
it did not penetrate anyway it is three
tanks<00:04:14.069> left<00:04:14.280> on<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.610> enemy<00:04:14.730> side<00:04:15.060> we've<00:04:15.269> got

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
tanks left on the enemy side we've got

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.940 
tanks left on the enemy side we've got
quite<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.660> few<00:04:15.810> tanks<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.200> our<00:04:16.320> side<00:04:16.560> i'm<00:04:16.709> up<00:04:16.829> to

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
quite a few tanks on our side i'm up to

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.099 
quite a few tanks on our side i'm up to
four<00:04:16.980> kills<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:18.090> we're<00:04:18.540> just<00:04:18.720> moving<00:04:18.870> up

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
four kills and we're just moving up

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.930 
four kills and we're just moving up
hopefully<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:20.130> thing<00:04:20.310> does<00:04:20.519> turn<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.760> little

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
hopefully this thing does turn a little

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.250 
hopefully this thing does turn a little
bit<00:04:21.120> slow<00:04:21.860> again<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:24.630> kind<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:24.960> interesting

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
bit slow again it's kind of interesting

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.629 
bit slow again it's kind of interesting

first class so far this is the fourth
battle<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.060> believe<00:04:54.440> in<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.590> it's<00:04:55.800> not<00:04:55.950> that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
battle I believe in it it's not that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.920 
battle I believe in it it's not that
hard<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.340> get<00:04:56.520> these<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:57.030> award<00:04:57.389> especially

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
hard to get these this award especially

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.510 
hard to get these this award especially
at<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.080> lower<00:04:58.229> tiers<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:59.040> much<00:04:59.250> harder<00:04:59.400> to

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
at the lower tiers it's much harder to

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.620 
at the lower tiers it's much harder to
get<00:04:59.639> at<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.820> higher<00:04:59.970> tier<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.330> then<00:05:00.419> we<00:05:00.510> got

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630
