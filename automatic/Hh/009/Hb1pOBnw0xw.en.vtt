00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.750 

all<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:00.690> so<00:00:00.930> we<00:00:01.350> can<00:00:01.380> see<00:00:01.829> that<00:00:02.429> there<00:00:02.730> is

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right so we can see that there is

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.420 
all right so we can see that there is
this<00:00:03.149> change<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.080> arrival<00:00:04.620> times<00:00:04.920> which<00:00:05.250> we

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
this change of arrival times which we

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.490 
this change of arrival times which we
can<00:00:05.609> then<00:00:05.730> convert<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.210> effectively<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.080> orbit

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
can then convert to effectively in orbit

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.339 
can then convert to effectively in orbit
and<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.639> when<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.179> do<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:09.780> all<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and so when you do this for all of the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.789 
and so when you do this for all of the
data<00:00:10.610> as<00:00:11.610> best<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:13.320> realize<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
data as best as you can you realize that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.680 
data as best as you can you realize that
there's<00:00:14.549> not<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:14.940> two<00:00:15.150> planets<00:00:15.509> there's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
there's not just two planets there's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.230 
there's not just two planets there's
actually<00:00:16.139> three<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.490> these<00:00:17.640> pulsars<00:00:18.150> are

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
actually three because these pulsars are

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880 
actually three because these pulsars are
amazing<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.900> accurately<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.619> measure

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
amazing how accurately you can measure

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
amazing how accurately you can measure
things<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.420> measure<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.810> example

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
things and you can measure for example

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900 
things and you can measure for example
the<00:00:22.289> masses<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.740> these<00:00:22.859> things<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.670> innermost

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the masses of these things the innermost

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.550 
the masses of these things the innermost
one<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.750> smaller<00:00:25.170> than<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> moon

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
one is actually smaller than the moon

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.179 
one is actually smaller than the moon
tiny<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> hundreds<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.470> earth<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.130> its

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
tiny so to hundreds of the earth in its

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
tiny so to hundreds of the earth in its
mass<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.000> tiny<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
mass that is tiny the other two are a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020 
mass that is tiny the other two are a
bit<00:00:31.470> further<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.160> they've<00:00:32.279> both<00:00:32.730> about

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
bit further out and they've both about

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
bit further out and they've both about
four<00:00:33.540> times<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> mass<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> earth<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
four times the mass of the earth so

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.200 
four times the mass of the earth so
nothing<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.820> our<00:00:35.910> own<00:00:35.940> solar

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
nothing like that in our own solar

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
nothing like that in our own solar
system<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> B<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:37.980> big<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> gas

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
system these a B but not as big as a gas

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.920 
system these a B but not as big as a gas
giant<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.120> definitely<00:00:39.719> bigger<00:00:39.899> than

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
giant can it's definitely bigger than

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.209 
giant can it's definitely bigger than
any<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> rocky<00:00:40.379> planets<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.040> when<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
any of the rocky planets but when you

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
any of the rocky planets but when you
say<00:00:41.399> far<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.360> mean<00:00:42.780> far

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
say far out you don't really mean far

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.529 
say far out you don't really mean far
out<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> mean<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.250> two<00:00:44.910> tenths<00:00:45.270> much

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
out I mean this one is two tenths much

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
out I mean this one is two tenths much
closer<00:00:45.899> than<00:00:46.050> mercury<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> Sun<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
closer than mercury is to the Sun and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.110 
closer than mercury is to the Sun and
even<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> said

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
even these two are about what as I said

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.100 
even these two are about what as I said
you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.360> they're<00:00:51.570> sort<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.930> where

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you know they're sort of in where

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.410 
you know they're sort of in where
mercury<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.340> they're<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mercury would be so they're all very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.619 
mercury would be so they're all very
close<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> star<00:00:55.500> itself<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.510> also

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
close to the star itself and we can also

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
close to the star itself and we can also
measure<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> eccentricity<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
measure the eccentricity this is a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.479 
measure the eccentricity this is a
measure<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> how<00:00:59.640> off<00:00:59.910> circular<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.020> orbit<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
measure of how off circular the orbit is

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.380 
measure of how off circular the orbit is
eccentricity<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> zero<00:01:02.789> means<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> orbit<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
eccentricity of zero means the orbit is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.539 
eccentricity of zero means the orbit is
a<00:01:03.449> perfect<00:01:03.899> circle<00:01:04.320> eccentricity<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> one

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
a perfect circle eccentricity of one

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.250 
a perfect circle eccentricity of one
would<00:01:05.700> mean<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> parabola<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.049> these

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
would mean it's a parabola and these

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
would mean it's a parabola and these
things<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.650> pretty<00:01:07.979> close<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> zero<00:01:08.400> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
things actually pretty close to zero we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.260 
things actually pretty close to zero we
can't<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.790> measure<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
can't really measure it for the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.490 
can't really measure it for the
innermost<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.140> assuming<00:01:10.320> it's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
innermost one so we're assuming it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
innermost one so we're assuming it's
zero<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.100> two<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.700> measure<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
zero but for these two we can measure it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
zero but for these two we can measure it
the<00:01:12.780> eccentricities<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.470> very<00:01:13.619> very<00:01:13.860> small

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the eccentricities are very very small

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
the eccentricities are very very small
they're<00:01:14.310> close<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> an<00:01:15.720> almost<00:01:16.259> perfect

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
they're close in and an almost perfect

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
they're close in and an almost perfect
circular<00:01:17.040> orbits<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> don't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
circular orbits all right and you don't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
circular orbits all right and you don't
expect<00:01:18.570> planets<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.680> born<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.310> nice

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
expect planets to be born with nice

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
expect planets to be born with nice
circular<00:01:20.880> orbits<00:01:21.479> especially<00:01:21.960> after<00:01:22.110> they've

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
circular orbits especially after they've

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
circular orbits especially after they've
been<00:01:22.439> slammed<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.220> supernova<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.450> could

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
been slammed with a supernova it could

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.030 
been slammed with a supernova it could
have<00:01:24.659> been<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> stars<00:01:25.439> around<00:01:25.680> some

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
have been some of the stars around some

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.960 
have been some of the stars around some
of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> planets<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.520> our<00:01:26.580> own<00:01:26.640> solar<00:01:26.729> system

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
of the planets in our own solar system

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.429 
of the planets in our own solar system
have<00:01:27.240> circular<00:01:27.600> orbits<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.200> after

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
have circular orbits but you know after

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.359 
have circular orbits but you know after
a<00:01:28.470> supernova<00:01:28.710> going<00:01:29.009> off<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.189> certainly

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
a supernova going off they certainly

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.219 
a supernova going off they certainly
won't<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.640> anymore

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
won't be anymore

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.240 
won't be anymore
this<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.619> impression<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.130> these

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
this is a first impression of what these

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.410 
this is a first impression of what these
things<00:01:32.430> might<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:32.880> like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
things might look like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.840 
things might look like
not<00:01:34.350> yet<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.250> fact<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
not yet which in fact from one of the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.830 
not yet which in fact from one of the
parents<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.329> ones<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.540> look<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
parents the other ones just look like

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
parents the other ones just look like
dots<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.290> wouldn't<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.829> maybe<00:01:38.700> too

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
dots they wouldn't like like maybe too

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
dots they wouldn't like like maybe too
far<00:01:39.090> away<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> actually<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> disks<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
far away to actually see the disks and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.990 
far away to actually see the disks and
this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.340> an<00:01:41.400> awesome<00:01:41.460> question<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this is an awesome question what a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.039 
this is an awesome question what a
pulsar<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
pulsar might look like you look at the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
pulsar might look like you look at the
very<00:01:43.200> strong<00:01:43.470> mining<00:01:43.710> fields<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.399> no<00:01:44.490> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
very strong mining fields but no one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.389 
very strong mining fields but no one
really<00:01:44.759> knows<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.600> even<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.740> Aurora

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
really knows they can even put Aurora

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.560 
really knows they can even put Aurora
meaning<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:47.939> must<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.329> sort<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
meaning there must be some sort of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.149 
meaning there must be some sort of
atmosphere<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.070> I'd

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
atmosphere there but I don't think I'd

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.800 
atmosphere there but I don't think I'd
be<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> vacation<00:01:50.909> at<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.509> planet

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
be going for a vacation at this planet

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.300 
be going for a vacation at this planet
and<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.470> are<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> cold

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and these are going to be cold

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
and these are going to be cold
irradiated<00:01:54.210> planets<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.899> zapped<00:01:55.259> by

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
irradiated planets going to be zapped by

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
irradiated planets going to be zapped by
huge<00:01:55.710> amounts<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> x-rays<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> Pulsar

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
huge amounts of x-rays from the Pulsar

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
huge amounts of x-rays from the Pulsar
and<00:01:57.360> not<00:01:58.170> much<00:01:58.350> heat<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and not much heat so these are going to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.690 
and not much heat so these are going to
be<00:01:59.520> frigid<00:02:00.270> radioactive<00:02:01.549> probably<00:02:02.549> very

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
be frigid radioactive probably very

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.660 
be frigid radioactive probably very
unpleasant<00:02:03.210> places<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> live<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:04.670> really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
unpleasant places to live I don't really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
unpleasant places to live I don't really
as<00:02:05.850> nice<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> picture<00:02:06.540> says<00:02:08.539> but<00:02:09.539> let<00:02:09.569> me

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
as nice as this picture says but let me

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059 
as nice as this picture says but let me
make<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.020> puzzle<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.619> mean<00:02:10.830> we've<00:02:11.039> just

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
make this a puzzle I mean we've just

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.860 
make this a puzzle I mean we've just
agreed<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.239> around<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.140> neutrons

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
agreed that this around a neutrons

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.990 
agreed that this around a neutrons
around<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> pulsar<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.190> one<00:02:15.459> place<00:02:15.760> where

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
around a pulsar is the one place where

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.119 
around a pulsar is the one place where
you<00:02:16.030> cannot<00:02:16.629> get<00:02:16.930> parents<00:02:17.260> because<00:02:17.530> they<00:02:17.650> we

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
you cannot get parents because they we

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.000 
you cannot get parents because they we
know<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.489> planets<00:02:18.670> form<00:02:19.170> when<00:02:20.170> solar<00:02:20.739> system

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
know that planets form when solar system

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.280 
know that planets form when solar system
forms<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.150> after<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.540> you've<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:23.019> get<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
forms but after that you've to get to a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.449 
forms but after that you've to get to a
past<00:02:23.500> we've<00:02:23.650> got<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.860> go<00:02:23.920> through<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.400> least

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
past we've got to go through at least

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.100 
past we've got to go through at least
one<00:02:24.760> supernova<00:02:25.239> explosion

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
one supernova explosion

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.470 
one supernova explosion
so<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.650> puzzle<00:02:26.950> number<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.580> house<00:02:28.360> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so it's puzzle number one you house the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.100 
so it's puzzle number one you house the
planet<00:02:28.780> survive<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.650> immense<00:02:30.160> explosion

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
planet survive this immense explosion

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.020 
planet survive this immense explosion
yeah<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.680> other<00:02:32.830> question<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.340> why<00:02:33.730> are

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
yeah and the other question is why are

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
yeah and the other question is why are
their<00:02:34.330> orbits<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:34.840> circular<00:02:35.290> almost

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
their orbits so circular almost

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.309 
their orbits so circular almost
certainly<00:02:36.099> they<00:02:36.819> survive<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.690> supernova

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
certainly they survive that supernova

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.410 
certainly they survive that supernova
explosion<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.430> gonna<00:02:39.760> knock<00:02:40.060> them<00:02:40.299> into

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
explosion that's gonna knock them into

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.289 
explosion that's gonna knock them into
some<00:02:40.750> eccentric<00:02:41.440> orbit<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.819> something

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
some eccentric orbit and so something

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.930 
some eccentric orbit and so something
would<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.750> had<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.200> make<00:02:44.379> them<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:45.549> into<00:02:45.910> a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
would have had to make them go into a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360 
would have had to make them go into a
nice<00:02:46.180> circular<00:02:46.690> orbit<00:02:47.260> again<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.860> pulsar

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
nice circular orbit again but the pulsar

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.770 
nice circular orbit again but the pulsar
isn't<00:02:48.760> gonna<00:02:48.849> do<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.360> long<00:02:49.510> ways<00:02:49.750> away

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
isn't gonna do it it's a long ways away

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.110 
isn't gonna do it it's a long ways away
and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.099> get<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> third<00:02:51.430> puzzle<00:02:51.670> remember

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
and then we get a third puzzle remember

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.059 
and then we get a third puzzle remember
to<00:02:52.269> form<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.959> these<00:02:53.079> millisecond<00:02:53.620> pulsars

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
to form one of these millisecond pulsars

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.100 
to form one of these millisecond pulsars
you<00:02:54.220> need<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.489> companion<00:02:55.329> star<00:02:55.599> which<00:02:55.989> will

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
you need a companion star which will

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.990 
you need a companion star which will
swell<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.680> dump<00:02:56.860> gas<00:02:57.069> into<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.910> will

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
swell up and dump gas into it and will

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.369 
swell up and dump gas into it and will
then<00:02:58.120> leave<00:02:58.299> behind<00:02:58.569> either<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.810> neutron<00:02:59.140> star

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
then leave behind either a neutron star

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.350 
then leave behind either a neutron star
or<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.530> white<00:02:59.709> dwarf<00:02:59.920> but<00:03:00.879> we're<00:03:01.000> not<00:03:01.120> seeing

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
or a white dwarf but we're not seeing

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.550 
or a white dwarf but we're not seeing
that<00:03:01.480> these<00:03:01.930> planets<00:03:02.170> are<00:03:02.290> nothing<00:03:02.500> like

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
that these planets are nothing like

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.530 
that these planets are nothing like
massive<00:03:02.829> enough<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.000> where<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
massive enough to do this so where is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.150 
massive enough to do this so where is
the<00:03:04.959> companion<00:03:05.410> star<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.860> got<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
the companion star that got the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.710 
the companion star that got the
millisecond<00:03:06.610> pulsar<00:03:06.970> spit<00:03:07.329> up<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.599> these

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
millisecond pulsar spit up to these

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.710 
millisecond pulsar spit up to these
things<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.370> let's<00:03:09.489> look<00:03:09.610> at<00:03:09.730> these<00:03:09.849> some

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
things so let's look at these some

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720 
things so let's look at these some
possible<00:03:11.129> explanations<00:03:12.129> for<00:03:12.549> how<00:03:12.670> you

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
possible explanations for how you

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.970 
possible explanations for how you
actually<00:03:13.000> form<00:03:13.209> these<00:03:13.420> things<00:03:13.660> okay<00:03:14.349> Paul<00:03:14.620> so

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
actually form these things okay Paul so

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.330 
actually form these things okay Paul so
we<00:03:15.489> have<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> bunch<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.120> problems<00:03:17.019> here<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.889> why

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
we have a bunch of problems here of why

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.680 
we have a bunch of problems here of why
I<00:03:18.370> didn't<00:03:18.760> think<00:03:18.940> there<00:03:19.060> should<00:03:19.239> be<00:03:19.269> planets

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
I didn't think there should be planets

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.710 
I didn't think there should be planets
here<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.280> first<00:03:21.459> place<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.030> how<00:03:22.569> are<00:03:22.630> we

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
here in the first place so how are we

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.750 
here in the first place so how are we
gonna<00:03:22.870> actually<00:03:23.200> go<00:03:23.680> through<00:03:23.889> and<00:03:24.459> come<00:03:24.639> up

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
gonna actually go through and come up

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.520 
gonna actually go through and come up
with<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:24.940> scenario<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.989> explain<00:03:26.290> why<00:03:26.470> these

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
with a scenario to explain why these

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.770 
with a scenario to explain why these
things<00:03:26.859> are<00:03:27.069> here<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.819> it's<00:03:27.940> true<00:03:28.299> three<00:03:28.690> of

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
things are here what it's true three of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.879 
things are here what it's true three of
the<00:03:28.870> theories<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.260> people<00:03:29.440> have<00:03:29.620> come<00:03:29.769> up

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
the theories that people have come up

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.890 
the theories that people have come up
with<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.340> might<00:03:30.519> possibly<00:03:30.730> explain<00:03:31.329> where

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
with and it might possibly explain where

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.940 
with and it might possibly explain where
these<00:03:32.019> things<00:03:32.170> come<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.739> first

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
these things come from the first

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.099 
these things come from the first
theories<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:33.459> really<00:03:33.639> are<00:03:33.849> survivors<00:03:34.269> they

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
theories there really are survivors they

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.720 
theories there really are survivors they
were<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:35.410> before<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.310> star<00:03:36.549> went

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
were there before the star went

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.759 
were there before the star went
supernova<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.239> somehow<00:03:37.480> they<00:03:37.720> survived<00:03:38.109> so

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
supernova and somehow they survived so

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.650 
supernova and somehow they survived so
see<00:03:39.010> if<00:03:39.069> this<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.340> at<00:03:39.459> all<00:03:39.579> feasible<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.510> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
see if this is at all feasible and the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.020 
see if this is at all feasible and the
reason<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.959> like<00:03:41.109> this<00:03:41.500> idea<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:42.069> because<00:03:42.430> we

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
reason we like this idea is because we

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.030 
reason we like this idea is because we
know<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.480> planets<00:03:43.720> form<00:03:44.109> at<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.650> same<00:03:44.680> time

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
know that planets form at the same time

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680 
know that planets form at the same time
of<00:03:45.190> stars<00:03:45.400> remember<00:03:46.239> we<00:03:46.299> have<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.419> giant

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
of stars remember we have a giant

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.240 
of stars remember we have a giant
molecular<00:03:46.780> cloud<00:03:47.230> collapses<00:03:47.799> forms<00:03:48.160> a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
molecular cloud collapses forms a

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.339 
molecular cloud collapses forms a
spinning<00:03:48.519> disk<00:03:48.669> of<00:03:48.790> gas<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.260> planets<00:03:50.260> form

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
spinning disk of gas and planets form

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.069 
spinning disk of gas and planets form
then<00:03:50.739> since<00:03:51.310> when<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.489> plan<00:03:51.639> should<00:03:51.940> form<00:03:52.239> can

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
then since when the plan should form can

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.199 
then since when the plan should form can
they<00:03:53.230> possibly<00:03:53.470> survive<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.790> we<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.180> a

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
they possibly survive so we have a

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.819 
they possibly survive so we have a
couple<00:03:55.540> problems<00:03:55.720> here<00:03:56.139> first<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.590> all<00:03:56.680> we

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
couple problems here first of all we

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.949 
couple problems here first of all we
know<00:03:56.950> we<00:03:57.099> need<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.400> have<00:03:57.549> two<00:03:57.970> stars<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
know we need to have two stars in the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.930 
know we need to have two stars in the
center<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.950> if<00:04:00.099> you're<00:04:00.190> gonna<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.459> planets

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
center and if you're gonna have planets

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.370 
center and if you're gonna have planets
going<00:04:01.000> around<00:04:01.209> two<00:04:01.540> stars<00:04:01.840> they<00:04:02.019> gotta<00:04:02.200> be<00:04:02.349> out

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
going around two stars they gotta be out

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.530 
going around two stars they gotta be out
of<00:04:02.680> ways<00:04:02.829> or<00:04:03.370> they're<00:04:03.639> gonna<00:04:03.700> get<00:04:03.910> ejected<00:04:04.209> by

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
of ways or they're gonna get ejected by

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.970 
of ways or they're gonna get ejected by
these<00:04:04.750> two<00:04:04.930> stars<00:04:05.260> okay<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:05.680> they're<00:04:05.769> gonna<00:04:05.859> be

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
these two stars okay so they're gonna be

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.259 
these two stars okay so they're gonna be
much<00:04:06.069> further<00:04:06.280> out<00:04:06.459> than<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:06.760> penisfax<00:04:07.030> you

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
much further out than the penisfax you

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.640 
much further out than the penisfax you
see<00:04:07.480> around<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.720> pole<00:04:07.930> saw<00:04:08.109> that's<00:04:08.349> right<00:04:08.530> so

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
see around the pole saw that's right so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.629 
see around the pole saw that's right so
that's<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.950> first<00:04:09.099> problem

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
that's the first problem

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.460 
that's the first problem
the<00:04:09.819> second<00:04:10.090> problem<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.569> these<00:04:11.169> are<00:04:11.319> big

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
the second problem is these are big

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.460 
the second problem is these are big
stars<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.430> as<00:04:12.730> they<00:04:13.299> run<00:04:13.989> out<00:04:14.169> of<00:04:14.200> their

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
stars and so as they run out of their

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.379 
stars and so as they run out of their
hydrogen<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.430> their<00:04:15.519> core<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.209> start

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
hydrogen and their core and start

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.909 
hydrogen and their core and start
burning<00:04:16.510> helium<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.320> heavier<00:04:17.859> elements

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
burning helium and heavier elements

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.940 
burning helium and heavier elements
fusing<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.060> they<00:04:19.810> become<00:04:20.169> huge<00:04:20.530> they<00:04:20.709> become

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
fusing it they become huge they become

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.370 
fusing it they become huge they become
red<00:04:21.220> giants<00:04:21.760> or<00:04:21.880> even<00:04:22.090> red<00:04:22.360> supergiant's<00:04:23.200> and

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
red giants or even red supergiant's and

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800 
red giants or even red supergiant's and
they're<00:04:23.860> going<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.130> expand<00:04:24.700> out<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:24.969> huge

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
they're going to expand out to huge

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.940 
they're going to expand out to huge
distances

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
distances

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.490 
distances
and<00:04:27.040> quite<00:04:27.640> frankly<00:04:27.850> potentially<00:04:28.780> go<00:04:29.020> engulf

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and quite frankly potentially go engulf

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.910 
and quite frankly potentially go engulf
these<00:04:30.180> star<00:04:31.180> are<00:04:31.510> these<00:04:31.720> planets<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.770> when

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
these star are these planets and when

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.220 
these star are these planets and when
those<00:04:33.040> planets<00:04:33.430> get<00:04:33.580> engulfed<00:04:33.880> in<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.450> red

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
those planets get engulfed in the red

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.620 
those planets get engulfed in the red
giant<00:04:35.470> they<00:04:35.980> will<00:04:36.010> get<00:04:36.820> dragged<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.570> they

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
giant they will get dragged and they

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.660 
giant they will get dragged and they
will<00:04:37.810> sort<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.050> get<00:04:38.230> consumed<00:04:38.890> by<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.280> star

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
will sort of get consumed by the star

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.670 
will sort of get consumed by the star
you<00:04:40.120> know<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.480> second<00:04:40.870> star<00:04:41.140> will<00:04:41.290> also<00:04:41.500> be<00:04:41.620> in

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
you know the second star will also be in

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.660 
you know the second star will also be in
the<00:04:41.710> middle<00:04:41.890> but<00:04:41.980> it's<00:04:42.100> got<00:04:42.220> enough<00:04:42.250> mass<00:04:42.550> to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
the middle but it's got enough mass to

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.100 
the middle but it's got enough mass to
keep<00:04:42.820> an<00:04:42.970> orbiting<00:04:43.330> even<00:04:43.540> inside<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.990> other

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
keep an orbiting even inside the other

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.630 
keep an orbiting even inside the other
star<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.650> short<00:04:44.860> period<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.370> planets

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
star for the short period the planets

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.160 
star for the short period the planets
from<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.850> don't<00:04:46.030> that's<00:04:46.570> right<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.050> that's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
from you don't that's right so that's

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.630 
from you don't that's right so that's
that's<00:04:47.560> that's<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:48.040> pretty<00:04:48.220> serious<00:04:48.460> problem

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
that's that's a pretty serious problem

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.280 
that's that's a pretty serious problem
and<00:04:49.540> then<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:51.040> star<00:04:51.370> explodes

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
and then that star explodes

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.220 
and then that star explodes
okay<00:04:53.290> so<00:04:53.350> let's<00:04:54.310> calculate<00:04:54.900> what<00:04:55.900> happens

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
okay so let's calculate what happens

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.660 
okay so let's calculate what happens
whether<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.800> planets<00:04:57.130> actually<00:04:57.250> survived

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
whether the planets actually survived

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.420 
whether the planets actually survived
the<00:04:57.790> explosion<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.360> star
