taken in this upcoming draft the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.990 
taken in this upcoming draft the
quarterback<00:01:10.920> position<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.520> obviously<00:01:11.850> an

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
quarterback position is obviously an

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
quarterback position is obviously an
overvalued<00:01:12.540> position<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.860> while<00:01:14.070> Smith<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
overvalued position so while Smith is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
overvalued position so while Smith is
probably<00:01:15.210> between<00:01:16.080> somewhere<00:01:16.590> between<00:01:16.680> a

probably between somewhere between a
tenth<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> 15<00:01:17.790> best<00:01:18.090> prospect<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> most

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
tenth and 15 best prospect on most

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
tenth and 15 best prospect on most
people's<00:01:19.920> boards<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:21.000> he<00:01:21.150> plays<00:01:21.330> a

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
grown to being a starter because you

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.920 
grown to being a starter because you
