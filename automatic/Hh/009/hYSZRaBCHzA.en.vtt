willing to bet when you think of space
you<00:00:10.590> imagine<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.130> smattering<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.880> twinkling

what's<00:01:08.760> stopping<00:01:09.180> us<00:01:09.299> from<00:01:09.330> seeing<00:01:09.750> other

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
what's stopping us from seeing other

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
galaxies in deep space it is true that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
galaxies in deep space it is true that
Andromeda<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.400> barely<00:01:14.760> visible<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.420> Earth

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
Andromeda is barely visible from Earth

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200

but<00:01:16.290> few<00:01:16.590> people<00:01:16.619> realize<00:01:17.220> how<00:01:17.430> incredibly

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but few people realize how incredibly

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.050 
but few people realize how incredibly
close<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.259> another<00:01:19.850> think<00:01:20.850> about

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
close we are to one another think about

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
close we are to one another think about
this<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.049> nearest<00:01:22.350> planet<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.979> earth<00:01:23.009> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this the nearest planet to earth is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
this the nearest planet to earth is
Venus<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.420> could<00:01:24.600> fit<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.990> 20,000

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
Venus and you could fit about 20,000

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
Venus and you could fit about 20,000
Earth's<00:01:26.220> between<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> orbits<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.450> Earth<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.170 
Earth's between the orbits of Earth and
Venus<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.159> many<00:01:29.220> milky<00:01:29.670> ways<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
Venus so how many milky ways do you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
Venus so how many milky ways do you
think<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> could<00:01:30.780> fit<00:01:31.049> between<00:01:31.530> us<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
think you could fit between us and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:32.719 
think you could fit between us and
Andromeda

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
twenty-five that's about the same number

the Milky Way and Andromeda are on a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so close in girona is still just a faint

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.490 
so close in girona is still just a faint

if we increase the brightness of
