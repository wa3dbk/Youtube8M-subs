 a taxi here, too, all poke on everything 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.340
 Shot was going to, moreover, as 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.649
 is said 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.780
 rust andres over and all there too immediately 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.940
 it is clear that snot 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.940
 here is this paint here even measure nothing 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:13.890
 shagreen leather from scratches and just here you can 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:16.430
 for the sake of interest only believe 137 should 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.430
 be 90 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:39.539
 500 400 tailoring salon there rift on 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.679
 the cover is very clean 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:02:02.770
 this hole on the roof is such a mess 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:02:12.959
 Salon is now clearly visible that unscrew 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 all non-native bolts even stand frayed 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:25.980
 not native tape recorder as it were no longer 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.940
 lacks

 it was clearly planted the door is not my own 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.950
 visible red color will come 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.689
 here painted another door worth this 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.689
 surina even 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.510
 it's boring, everything is crooked 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 also seen that the tape was painted here and then 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.430
 there was a blow to the front 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:44.900
 hit wing they just tint it 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.900

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.880
 it beat the door doesn't even take no 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.260
 even pierces the paint chasing bite 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.200
 not even punches with a door putty 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:11.960
 here Khan struck you heavily planted 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.960
 on before especially to measure does not make sense 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:39.690
 it is easier not to see that right 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:42.660
 heated don't even bother even 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.530
