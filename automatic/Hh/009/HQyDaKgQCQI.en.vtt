00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.390 
like that I'm going to dig in here three
blocks<00:02:43.540> each<00:02:43.840> time<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.530> one<00:02:44.769> two<00:02:45.250> three<00:02:46.170> three

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
blocks each time so one two three three

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.000 
blocks each time so one two three three
one<00:02:48.400> two<00:02:48.849> three<00:02:49.120> one<00:02:49.840> two<00:02:50.829> three<00:02:52.709> keep<00:02:53.709> doing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
one two three one two three keep doing

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.039 
one two three one two three keep doing
this<00:02:54.160> until<00:02:54.630> yes<00:02:55.739> there<00:02:57.060> now<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.390> going<00:02:58.870> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
this until yes there now I'm going to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:09.229 
this until yes there now I'm going to
come<00:02:59.739> up<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.160> quickly<00:03:03.389> if<00:03:04.389> I<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.690> get<00:03:04.870> there

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.590 

and<00:03:10.239> I'm<00:03:11.109> going<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.470> get<00:03:11.739> my<00:03:11.950> buckets<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:13.030> lava

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.270 

which<00:03:16.600> we're<00:03:16.780> going<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.930> use<00:03:17.019> this<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.130> going

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
which we're going to use this is going

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.150 
which we're going to use this is going
to<00:03:18.340> kill<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.790> monsters<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.600> we're<00:03:19.750> going<00:03:19.870> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
to kill the monsters so we're going to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.390 
to kill the monsters so we're going to
come<00:03:21.160> over<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.940> pick<00:03:22.359> up<00:03:22.569> bucket<00:03:23.109> there

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
come over here and pick up bucket there

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.009 
come over here and pick up bucket there
there<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:25.329> there<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.380> there

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
there there there and there

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.020 
there there there and there
so<00:03:29.019> now<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:29.500> will<00:03:29.709> look<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.910> it

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
so now it will look like this and it

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.370 
so now it will look like this and it
looks<00:03:31.060> really<00:03:31.359> kind<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.989> looks<00:03:32.170> really

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
looks really kind of it looks really

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.640 
looks really kind of it looks really
stupid<00:03:32.560> but<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.160> does<00:03:33.340> work<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.200> monsters

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
stupid but it does work so the monsters

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.199 
stupid but it does work so the monsters
are<00:03:35.799> basically<00:03:36.160> going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.459> come<00:03:36.639> down<00:03:36.819> here

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
are basically going to come down here

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.839 
are basically going to come down here
and<00:03:37.470> die<00:03:38.639> from<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.819> Lila<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:41.069> what<00:03:42.069> they<00:03:42.310> will

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and die from the Lila and what they will

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.699 
and die from the Lila and what they will
try<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.239> swim<00:03:43.569> up<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.079> what<00:03:44.290> I'm<00:03:44.380> going<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> do

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
try and swim up so what I'm going to do

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.900 
try and swim up so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:44.980> pit<00:03:45.370> block

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
is pit block

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.870 
is pit block
along<00:03:46.599> here<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:47.440> they<00:03:47.799> can't<00:03:48.040> actually<00:03:48.340> swim

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
along here so they can't actually swim

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.009 
along here so they can't actually swim
up<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> lava<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:52.090> what<00:03:52.660> happens<00:03:52.900> it

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
up the lava and it what happens it

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.520 
up the lava and it what happens it
reduce<00:03:53.319> -<00:03:53.859> what<00:03:54.069> I<00:03:54.250> love<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.700> they<00:03:55.239> will

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
reduce - what I love is that they will

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.830 
reduce - what I love is that they will
and<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.099> loot<00:03:57.310> will<00:03:57.579> not<00:03:57.819> come<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.090> root<00:03:58.480> will

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
and the loot will not come out root will

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.379 
and the loot will not come out root will
be<00:03:59.290> destroyed<00:03:59.859> by<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:02.220> lava<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.549> if<00:04:03.849> you<00:04:04.030> have

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
be destroyed by the lava and if you have

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.759 
be destroyed by the lava and if you have
a<00:04:04.419> spider<00:04:05.049> trap<00:04:05.430> about<00:04:06.510> around<00:04:07.510> above<00:04:07.780> 50%<00:04:08.290> of

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
a spider trap about around above 50% of

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.110 
a spider trap about around above 50% of
the<00:04:08.950> loot<00:04:09.129> will<00:04:09.370> come<00:04:09.519> out<00:04:09.670> cousin

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the loot will come out cousin

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.930 
the loot will come out cousin
most<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.480> will<00:04:10.930> get<00:04:11.110> destroyed<00:04:11.409> by<00:04:11.620> lava<00:04:11.940> so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
most of it will get destroyed by lava so

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.910 
most of it will get destroyed by lava so
now<00:04:13.239> we're<00:04:13.450> going<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.599> test<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.290> see<00:04:14.680> if<00:04:14.739> I

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
now we're going to test it see if I

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.349 
now we're going to test it see if I
watch<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.250> before<00:04:15.370> we<00:04:15.610> test<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.970> we're<00:04:16.150> going

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
watch it before we test it we're going

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.039 
watch it before we test it we're going
to<00:04:16.419> need<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.690> go<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:18.299> make<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.359> bit<00:04:19.660> where<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
to need to go and make the bit where the

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.909 
to need to go and make the bit where the
water<00:04:20.320> will<00:04:20.620> come<00:04:20.799> out<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.470> five

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
water will come out so we have five

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.770 
water will come out so we have five
buckets<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.460> water<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.790> I'm<00:04:25.389> going<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.600> put

buckets of water here which nope not

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.490 
buckets of water here which nope not
there<00:04:33.220> they're<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.540> they're<00:04:35.080> there<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:37.500> go

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.409 

there<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:50.660> go

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
there we go

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.430 
there we go
this<00:04:53.419> is<00:04:53.600> where<00:04:53.780> just<00:04:53.930> where<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.229> loot<00:04:54.410> is

this is where just where the loot is
going<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.680> come<00:04:54.830> out<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.160> is<00:04:55.310> going<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.520> drop

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
going to come out and is going to drop

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.659 
going to come out and is going to drop

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
well so and look it should work with

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.080 
well so and look it should work with
spiders<00:07:06.140> it<00:07:06.650> technically<00:07:07.400> should<00:07:07.610> work<00:07:07.820> but

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
spiders it technically should work but

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:16.570 
spiders it technically should work but
I'm<00:07:08.600> not<00:07:08.660> sure<00:07:08.930> how<00:07:09.400> affected<00:07:15.010> because<00:07:16.010> since

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
I'm not sure how affected because since

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.810 
I'm not sure how affected because since
spiders<00:07:17.330> of<00:07:17.450> one<00:07:17.660> block<00:07:17.840> I<00:07:18.110> they<00:07:18.380> might<00:07:18.820> swim

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
spiders of one block I they might swim

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.180 
spiders of one block I they might swim
up<00:07:20.030> and<00:07:20.360> their<00:07:20.690> loot<00:07:20.900> might<00:07:21.140> be<00:07:21.410> destroyed<00:07:21.830> by

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
up and their loot might be destroyed by

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.690 
up and their loot might be destroyed by
the<00:07:22.250> lava<00:07:22.520> so<00:07:23.290> it's<00:07:24.290> like<00:07:24.620> I<00:07:24.860> could<00:07:25.280> tap<00:07:25.520> and

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
the lava so it's like I could tap and

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.220 
the lava so it's like I could tap and
I'm<00:07:25.790> not<00:07:25.940> really<00:07:26.030> sure<00:07:26.270> to<00:07:26.420> be<00:07:26.450> honest<00:07:26.750> but<00:07:26.990> I

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
I'm not really sure to be honest but I

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.730 
I'm not really sure to be honest but I
guess<00:07:28.160> you'll<00:07:28.310> just<00:07:28.340> have<00:07:28.520> to<00:07:28.700> find<00:07:28.790> out<00:07:29.000> and<00:07:29.740> I

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740 
guess you'll just have to find out and I

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.950 
guess you'll just have to find out and I
hope<00:07:31.640> to<00:07:31.760> go<00:07:31.880> to<00:07:31.940> the<00:07:32.090> Lord<00:07:32.300> it<00:07:32.630> doesn't<00:07:32.870> work

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
hope to go to the Lord it doesn't work

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.570 
hope to go to the Lord it doesn't work
for<00:07:32.990> spiders<00:07:33.440> because<00:07:33.530> I<00:07:33.680> just<00:07:33.980> make<00:07:34.130> it<00:07:34.160> so

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
for spiders because I just make it so

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.840 
for spiders because I just make it so
much<00:07:34.730> better<00:07:34.940> but<00:07:35.440> anyway<00:07:36.440> that's<00:07:36.920> the<00:07:37.400> trap

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.850 
much better but anyway that's the trap

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.960 
much better but anyway that's the trap
finished<00:07:38.240> they'll<00:07:38.420> know<00:07:38.540> see<00:07:38.690> you<00:07:38.780> there
