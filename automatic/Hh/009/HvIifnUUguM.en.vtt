00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.320
 p that we have set climax we are going to short our autocad guys 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.599
 mustafÃ¡ d 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.159
 to import 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.460
 we opened camus pubs 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.089
 our goat 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.119
 the kid 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.710
 we hope that a window is put 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980
 ouna neiva bit 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.310
 several explosions 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.540
 he is not saying he took them from autocad to man or woman 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.830
 i these are the import Chinese 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.340
 first we have the geometry tab 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.680
 here we go arre scale our drawing 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.610
 says quique is going to go in like millimeters 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 and the truth is that when we enter the autocad 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.190
 each quarter was spent in 2000 and 2007 what we expect 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.760
 we look for 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.730
 in autocad and we represent a unit like a subway 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.420
 everything that is not with the team 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.210
 meters 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020
 i'm going 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 to the other options 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.910
 this we will leave without 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.070
 these two cultures a thousand breeding options 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.810
 we are going to leave it as well as this one that the parameters require as external 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
 it's a lot also like that in 15 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.830
 Cowen hundred pazos 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.590
 and this is very important zero point are 0 1 meters 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.130
 that is being a millimeter 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 because because going to a millimeter 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.880
 good because it means that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 in the event of a millimeter they will form me 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.420
 some rounded papers 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.180
 or to put it arcs circles 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 and just a few lines per one millimeter 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 with that we are going to be the face the oc 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.500
 then we passed laws 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.570
 and in them we will see each of the layers that were in our in our 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.899
 autocad guys 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.679
 for example I mentioned to them that we have I do not know not touched in Pakistan 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 the glass the mezzanine garden all the layers 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.319
 we are going to spend 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.069
 and if we want to pass all without exception we will point out 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.349
 Do not ask us 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.349
 the other is if I want to point out anything else 1 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.999
 I remove the popcorn to the others 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.759
 and I just want them to pass 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.759
 all garden 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.879
 this does not serve to point out all to point out any 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.109
 it was faster than I wanted to avoid 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.409
 eleven of the expensive ones and I want them 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.409
 i will go 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
 there are our goats 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.849
 as you can see there are four windows 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.869
 one 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.159
 in the first window we have the whole view with the floor view 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.139
 here the fontana view who used his left name and perspective 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.359
 We can see any any view 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.389
 in any window 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.180
 giving a right click on the name we will not go look for a view act here 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.399
 or perspective view 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:37.539
 seville is in perspective but seen from the above dress plant 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.199
 this command that you use 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.699
 it's like the autocad orbit and this one is 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.789
 they complain 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:53.519
 what less
