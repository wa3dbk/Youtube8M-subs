00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.189
 put an experiment you chose the light 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 for 10 scale was acquired such 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:15.380
 gt power kit ok sun with 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.380
 futaba receiver 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:24.470
 principle here goes 2 splitters for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.470
 not to open the radio box not 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:38.640
 such a tank comes in from here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.559
 such an extra channel is a struggle 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 disable and enable 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.670
 via the remote also comes this 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 trick switch garland 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:01.140
 Well, actually all the diodes are white yellow 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.500
 there I will show you this spike of three 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.880
 diodes I have already defended independently and not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 it was to leave what is the plus of this block 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 that there are buttons on it which 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:22.680
 allows you to reverse channels 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:26.580
 reverse 3 4 through you can play all 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.450
 it works fine principle i 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.570
 connected the standard agency replaced 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.549
 rear 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.680
 white LEDs so that they 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.750
 afraid because the front a little bit 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.750
 change works like this 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.509
 constantly on 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:09.429
 how to envelope the front rear glow 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:09.429
 yellow red turn signals running 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:28.910
 garland switches as follows 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:32.780
 hold for two seconds turns on this 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:38.680
 megane incomprehensible yet she 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.680
 there is a switch this mode 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590
 cut out 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:09.050
 jump everything burns and accordingly 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.990
 classic mode can also be valid 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:18.280
 Channel 3 to keep the light on constantly 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:22.580
 you ca nâ€™t turn it on 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:30.620
 This is a separate look, you listen 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:33.800
 the channel is changing to the chandelier I connected 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:41.930
 instead of 3 channels, place 2 diodes of 3 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.440
 millimeter I connected the chandelier that is 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.830
 when 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:53.390
 quiet mode is neutral and does not burn with 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.750
 all or you can turn on the reverse 3 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.760
 channel it will burn constantly here 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.940
 turn on the reverse 3 channel chandelier lights 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.940
 constantly 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.350
 you can also turn on the reverse 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.310
 the road to the new will burn back 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.310
 those yellow lanterns constantly 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.230
 the advertisement is all small 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:50.730
 on the second channel 4 channels turn on fine 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:04.540
 air and fat and are you always 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:17.790
 the Greeks are nice and the canal we meet a chandelier 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:21.390
 goes out and turns on only the floor we remove 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.390
 strip diodes 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.170
 You can play a lot of options 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:36.820
 Stars, however, in principle, I am satisfied 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:39.990
 This set has four types of war 'and we 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.990
 look like
