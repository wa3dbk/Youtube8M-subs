but<00:00:32.610> I've<00:00:32.940> yet<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> find<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:35.010> assuming

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
but I've yet to find one so I'm assuming

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
but I've yet to find one so I'm assuming
I'm<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.210> YouTube<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.780> show<00:00:36.960> how

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I'm the first one on YouTube to show how

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
I'm the first one on YouTube to show how
to<00:00:37.290> listen<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.730> um<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.660> sure

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to listen this one but um not sure

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.110 
to listen this one but um not sure
so<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.090> mean<00:00:42.090> here's<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> finished<00:00:42.780> product

so I mean here's the finished product

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.860 
so I mean here's the finished product
only<00:00:45.120> real<00:00:46.219> difference<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> guess<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:48.510> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
only real difference I guess is that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860 
only real difference I guess is that
