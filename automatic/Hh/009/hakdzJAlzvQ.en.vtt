00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 Good day to all dear 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.389
 friends with you rashim dota 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.719
 Czech did not know what to write want to do 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 a short video so I got the idea that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.359
 probably that many did not know but maybe 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 to be and knew and all but nonetheless that I 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.050
 speak soloist and so how would advice for 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.330
 novice dota players you stand on 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.880
 the lines tell you well creeps again 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 crouching or you on thinking you runs on 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 farm shield began his act of killing 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.770
 because I am distant fights you melee and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 even if he is not close combat over them his 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.300
 on stuff how to do it all to you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 you are not stranded on creep 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.030
 all circumstances if you will of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.829
 the touch on an enemy hero in radius 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 500 oh e from this hero and on from you there 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.710
 with you such a small circle that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.479
 such growth creeps will aggro in any 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 case to see immediately the pops ran 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.640
 me because it does not protect this 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.700
 shit 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 how to avoid it you ask for this 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.740
 you need a hero with an automatic 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 attack modifier what is it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.530
 read the wiki and either think yourself 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.659
 I mean, this is what gives your attack 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 orb effects effect extra 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.740
 effect of someone watermelon someone not 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.540
 now naturally there is no more of it all 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 does not remember ok this case so clinkz 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.869
 his fire arrows and they give us 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.299
 additional types of fire attacks and so 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.430
 how it all works and how for what and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.159
 why do we need to have any heroes 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.579
 the thing is that when used so 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.080
 run away the whole thing is that when 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.270
 using 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.150
 this ability is also an ability 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.210
 in manual mode and in manual mode then 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.890
 there each time to press the r button you 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 probably will still play cubes and so on 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270
 default I have all the classic worth it 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.070
 there is always pressing the given button 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.229
 hero abilities enemy heroes 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.510
 creeps will not be on you from the face it's very 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.860
 important so we repeat again pressing 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.930
 every time the auto button 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.050
 automatically attack modifier 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.480
 hero somehow so much for creeps so 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.750
 check whether it is so or not so 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.640
 we press everything everything is fine everything is fine 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.980
 creeps is absolutely poker that is if there 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
 Whether or not you beat if you if you take 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.709
 enemy hero or not it works with 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.680
 it works as frost arus 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.640
 drow ranger it works with a liquid fire 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.530
 am this here mdm joker and well and everything 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.330
 the rest are automatically exactly 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.410
 ability to attack automatically 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.060
 modifiers will also act 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.860
 it is even in my opinion this code is like 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.080
 First of all I do not remember exactly the ability to call 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.239
 already and so on let's take it so 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.720
 hop repent pidarasy apologize for mate 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.700
 certainly kill because they do not because no one but 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040
 face of headlights on remark important notes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.570
 if you put in no manual mode then 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.000
 there will not push anyone what is 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.709
 Of course there will be a pour in and if you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.570
 put in automatic mode and 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.430
 look it turns out so you're nothing 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.230
 prepare and we will volume without it 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.630
 modifier I mean it is like a 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.130
 equals creeps to normal attack 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.030
 very stupid to the stadium to be honest 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.300
 strange clip and 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.850
 and so we put it again so here we start 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.320
 Immediately automatically Jagr I mean that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.900
 all to avoid 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.180
 aggro always use manual mode 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.200
 manual guidance mode and you will be 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.049
 happiness okay kids all health everyone 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.450
 bye and 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.930
 love-kisses play big dota bye 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.930
