through this whole muscle car arena

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.649 
through this whole muscle car arena
but<00:04:25.759> it<00:04:25.879> also<00:04:26.349> had<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.710> best-performing

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
but it also had the best-performing

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.110 
but it also had the best-performing
engine<00:04:29.659> that<00:04:30.530> we<00:04:30.770> knew<00:04:31.009> how<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.280> build<00:04:31.550> so

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120
