00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:11.990
 Hello everyone, in general, today decided to take off 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.990
 how to repair video 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 front feet 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:24.320
 front suspension supports on the weight of dosage 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.780
 dance c180 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 that's who I'm scared just found like 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.219
 Kit bought a new one for but I will show how 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.510
 you can repair and not buy 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:52.170
 Here is one such kit I will show it costs 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 win about 5000 looking even more to take 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.489
 an icon here I took off just rent a house 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.059
 here is this thing 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.059
 support she stands 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:21.110
 about 5 there are even 6 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:24.130
 It looks like that very often it happens that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.130
 exactly the bearing 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:40.630
 you can see here the focus is where are you this one 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:43.869
 bearing shorter breaks wear out and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:52.280
 The support is the end, that is, you can buy 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:55.820
 the kit is new and change so fit by 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.399
 by the mouth here so what can we do here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.930
 look see this bearing 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:07.570
 you can easily remove it from here 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:12.049
 we pick a screwdriver stuck a screwdriver 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.459
 pick it up remove us remain 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.560
 prop just prop 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.870
 piece of gum what we do next is very 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.209
 easy and simple not to spend on that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.560
 thing how much is there 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:35.959
 56 thousand before what we do we just 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:42.320
 take buying firms ruins here such 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.959
 bearings and then here I take off buying 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.590
 Here are the bearings they are here that right now 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.590
 and I'll get a second changing there is this 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:06.110
 you see he is exactly the same as in 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:12.060
 the original here look one to one 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.580
 old bearing take remove 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:23.550
 screwdriver just pick it up 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:30.030
 thrown take a new one and take it and stupid 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:37.350
 dress some say that but for for 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:41.280
 to keep him there a hundred percent 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:48.450
 or somehow we can buy it 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:52.400
 sealant and put it on sealant 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:04:01.040
 you can still and I do not see sense because 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:01.040
 he will come in and hold on well here 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 so the same thing to the second system 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:18.010
 and we do not need to buy and spend 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:22.340
 how many there are 6,000 up and just take 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.000
 bearing for now I will say for how much I 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.230
 bought it 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.720
 but in my opinion 500 rubles whole 500 rubles 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:38.620
 that is, two bearings we get 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:44.340
 thousand rubles but thousand rubles and 11-12 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.409
 like big think so here 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.949
 so that 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.580
 what can you tell someone liked 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.369

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.369
