00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello for this new tutorial we're going 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.630
 see how to start a game without the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:18.020
 remote control of the xk so of course he we 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 need a console with the xk to install 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 then we need hard drive and then 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.359
 the cable and then the cable in it is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.989
 on one side there is a good decision bah me 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.550
 it's a usb 2 so it's a micro usb 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.969
 and then on the other side there is the port 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 usb 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 the main main support that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 this one 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:50.010
 and then the little replication that you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.070
 see there so we'll already perform all 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 the connections to the console so we 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.300
 branch already the main port on the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.300
 your gun 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.059
 replication is plugged next to it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:21.810
 here is the micro usb branch 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:28.220
 on the hard drive 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.220
 and then plug in the TV cable 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 and food 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.100
 so we turn on the console 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.120
 so to start a game without 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.940
 remote control we go directly through the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.940
 console menu by the dashboard 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.869
 so here is according to your hard drive there 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.050
 in which are more or less long to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 start just wait 5 10 seconds 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:24.099
 and so then that on the side and so 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:32.700
 then we will go to water whose 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:32.700
 menu applications here apps 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.860
 then my apps 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 then photo viewer 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.210
 and then the second line disks 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.330
 current 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.800
 so you see there it is gray so we 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.710
 can not go but for whom 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.010
 get busy just press just a 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.200
 the eject button on the console 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.940
 you press gect of course the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.270
 reader does not come out since it is the xk 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.430
 that activate and as soon as he found the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.920
 games directory with a game in there 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.600
 current records that greets then badly at 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.470
 dashboard 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.860
 so we go inside and there you have 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.300
 two directories so the first one serves to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.870
 nothing is about is right next so 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.870
 there will be the name of your hard drive 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.820
 so I wanted to have given so that's it 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.120
 it's game xbox we get in and then 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.970
 there then there are all the games that I put 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:55.770
 so I numbered eg 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:59.300
 if we want to throw a parasite batman ac 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.300
 so we select him 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.610
 and then he tells us to press it on 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.520
 failure all aude to say that we do and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.930
 jacques for throwing ejected on the 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.670
 console of course supported the shot that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.140
 back page back and if you have 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.550
 activated automatic launch 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.550
 it will start directly 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.859
 here 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.550
 so there as a classic game there are 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.550
 protections and after them in six matches 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.140
 it's good for hard drives and that's it 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.150
 ok if you want to change the game next 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.470
 more than to eject so it's a 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.310
 come back on the interface that's you 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:09.229
 go back to applications 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:15.259
 then my viewer apps 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:20.330
 photo of what you have already selected 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:24.860
 for sale 2 in we will see directory the 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:29.020
 hard drive is here to select 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.020
 youtube for example at battlefield 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 dac 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.940
 the imposing scene on it a little leaning 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.930
 directly on failure to read it as 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.400
 his marks and on the screen and then there he 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.880
 go back one page and he goes 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.880
 Starting the game 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.180
 There you go 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.220
