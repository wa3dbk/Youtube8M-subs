close there Instagram next and I think

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
close there Instagram next and I think
the<00:00:53.399> iPhone<00:00:53.550> 6<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> hair<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.809> front

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the iPhone 6 was just a hair in front

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
the iPhone 6 was just a hair in front
with<00:00:55.230> loading<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> image<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> Nexus<00:00:56.489> 5

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
with loading the image but the Nexus 5

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
with loading the image but the Nexus 5

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
did actually finish refreshing the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.430 
did actually finish refreshing the
stream<00:00:58.350> first<00:00:59.059> IMDB<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.090> next<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.899> Nexus<00:01:01.260> 5

interesting<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> iPhone<00:01:34.170> 6<00:01:34.409> does

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
interesting here is the iPhone 6 does

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.859 
interesting here is the iPhone 6 does
refresh<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> feed<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> Nexus<00:01:36.119> 5<00:01:36.299> doesn't<00:01:36.750> so

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
refresh the feed the Nexus 5 doesn't so

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.120 
refresh the feed the Nexus 5 doesn't so
you<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.170> take<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.710> account<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you have to take that into account of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
you have to take that into account of
course<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.000> we're<00:01:39.150> seeing<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.509> guys<00:01:39.720> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
course so what we're seeing here guys is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
course so what we're seeing here guys is
this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> very<00:01:40.500> tightly<00:01:40.829> matched<00:01:41.159> it's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this is very tightly matched it's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
this is very tightly matched it's
actually<00:01:41.610> nip<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.939> tuck<00:01:42.150> either<00:01:42.479> way

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
actually nip and tuck either way

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
actually nip and tuck either way
sometimes<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> iPhone<00:01:43.439> 6<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.799> winning

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sometimes the iPhone 6 is winning

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
sometimes the iPhone 6 is winning
sometimes<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> Nexus<00:01:44.880> 5<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.090> winning<00:01:45.479> what's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
sometimes the Nexus 5 is winning what's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.719 
sometimes the Nexus 5 is winning what's
interesting<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> Nexus<00:01:47.280> 5<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.490> about

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
interesting here is the Nexus 5 is about

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.219 
interesting here is the Nexus 5 is about
a<00:01:47.909> year<00:01:48.240> old<00:01:48.270> we're<00:01:48.600> probably<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> see<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
a year old we're probably going to see a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
a year old we're probably going to see a
refresh<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> Nexus<00:01:50.280> 5<00:01:50.460> pretty<00:01:50.850> soon<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
refresh for the Nexus 5 pretty soon when

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.330 
refresh for the Nexus 5 pretty soon when
I<00:01:51.899> opened<00:01:52.259> chrome<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.860> found<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.159> bit

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I opened chrome actually found this bit

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
I opened chrome actually found this bit
quite<00:01:53.549> interesting<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.450> slow

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
quite interesting so I actually slow

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
quite interesting so I actually slow
this<00:01:54.960> down<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.470> hit<00:01:55.799> these<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.219> much

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this down I hit these up pretty much

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.100 
this down I hit these up pretty much
exactly<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.030> same<00:01:57.149> time<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:57.600> you'll<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
exactly the same time but you'll see the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
exactly the same time but you'll see the
iPhone<00:01:58.380> 6<00:01:58.649> reacts<00:01:58.979> instantly<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> Nexus<00:02:00.090> 5<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
iPhone 6 reacts instantly the Nexus 5 is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
iPhone 6 reacts instantly the Nexus 5 is
a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.810> delayed<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.740> does<00:02:01.890> catch

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
a little bit delayed but it does catch

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.830 
a little bit delayed but it does catch
up<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.850> finish<00:02:03.119> loading<00:02:03.420> chrome

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
up and actually finish loading chrome

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
up and actually finish loading chrome
first<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.829> as<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.040> was<00:02:05.159> saying<00:02:05.369> before<00:02:05.430> it's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
first so as I was saying before it's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.670 
first so as I was saying before it's
pretty<00:02:05.969> impressive<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> Nexus<00:02:07.049> 5<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.290> able

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
pretty impressive that a Nexus 5 is able

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.469 
pretty impressive that a Nexus 5 is able
to<00:02:07.799> keep<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> iPhone<00:02:08.729> 6<00:02:08.759> considering

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
performance I went ahead and turned off

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.210 
performance I went ahead and turned off
animations<00:02:25.380> cuz<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.650> always<00:02:25.770> get<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> lot<00:02:26.130> of

questions saying the iPhone 6 has

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.570 
questions saying the iPhone 6 has
deliberately<00:02:27.959> slow<00:02:28.230> animations<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.250> I've<00:02:29.370> put

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
deliberately slow animations so I've put

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.160 
deliberately slow animations so I've put
reduced<00:02:29.910> motions<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.480> I've<00:02:30.600> also<00:02:30.720> turn<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
reduced motions on I've also turn the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
reduced motions on I've also turn the
animations<00:02:31.620> off<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.070> Nexus<00:02:32.400> 5<00:02:32.430> again<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
animations off on the Nexus 5 again I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270 
animations off on the Nexus 5 again I
cleared<00:02:33.450> all<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.840> recents<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:35.010> did<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
cleared all the recents and we did the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.010 
cleared all the recents and we did the
test<00:02:35.520> again<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:35.850> basically<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.630> was<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> same

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
test again and basically it was the same

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.900 
test again and basically it was the same
result<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.890> Facebook<00:02:38.250> app<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.520> quite<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> bit

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
result the Facebook app was quite a bit

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.729 
result the Facebook app was quite a bit
faster<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.450> load<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> Nexus<00:02:40.200> 5<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.560> both

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
faster to load on the Nexus 5 in both

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.979 
faster to load on the Nexus 5 in both
occasions<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.910> generally<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.720> pretty

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
occasions but generally it was pretty

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.840 
occasions but generally it was pretty
much<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.319> same<00:02:43.470> story<00:02:43.770> sometimes<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.520> Nexus

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
much the same story sometimes the Nexus

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790 
much the same story sometimes the Nexus
5<00:02:45.060> would<00:02:45.209> win<00:02:45.390> sometimes<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.080> iPhone<00:02:46.350> 6<00:02:46.650> would

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
5 would win sometimes the iPhone 6 would

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680 
5 would win sometimes the iPhone 6 would
win<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> margins<00:02:47.910> neither<00:02:48.209> case<00:02:48.480> are

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
win but the margins neither case are

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.420 
win but the margins neither case are
very<00:02:48.720> small<00:02:49.170> both<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.590> phones<00:02:49.830> are<00:02:50.160> still

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
very small both these phones are still

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.759 
very small both these phones are still
very<00:02:50.760> fast<00:02:51.090> would<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.780> honestly<00:02:52.080> notice<00:02:52.500> or

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
very fast would you honestly notice or

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.170 
very fast would you honestly notice or
care<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.250> didn't<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.610> both<00:02:53.850> devices

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
care if you didn't have both devices

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.000 
care if you didn't have both devices
next<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.780> each<00:02:54.900> other<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.500> now

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
next to each other like I do now

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
next to each other like I do now
probably<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.630> still

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
probably not no but it is still

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.509 
probably not no but it is still
interesting<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.380> see<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.680> even<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.280> year<00:02:59.459> old

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
interesting to see that even a year old

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.030 
interesting to see that even a year old
device<00:02:59.940> like<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.450> Nexus<00:03:00.810> 5<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.680> actually

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
device like the Nexus 5 can actually

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.710 
device like the Nexus 5 can actually
still<00:03:02.280> stand<00:03:02.610> up<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.910> least<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.300> terms<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
still stand up at least in terms of the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.780 
still stand up at least in terms of the
raw<00:03:03.870> app<00:03:04.019> opening<00:03:04.440> speed<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> iPhone<00:03:05.760> 6

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
raw app opening speed to the iPhone 6

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.550 
raw app opening speed to the iPhone 6
and<00:03:06.390> let's<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.959> forget<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.380> major

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and let's not forget the major

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.930 
and let's not forget the major
difference<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.190> price<00:03:08.400> between<00:03:08.640> these

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
difference in the price between these

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940 
difference in the price between these
two<00:03:09.120> devices<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.690> well<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.350> mentioned

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
two devices as well actually mentioned

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.440 
two devices as well actually mentioned
in<00:03:11.070> my<00:03:11.190> initial<00:03:11.459> impressions<00:03:11.910> video<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
in my initial impressions video for the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.820 
in my initial impressions video for the
iPhone<00:03:12.690> 6<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.260> didn't<00:03:13.500> feel<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.650> a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
iPhone 6 that it didn't feel like a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.530 
iPhone 6 that it didn't feel like a
major<00:03:14.130> step<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.760> terms<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.120> performance

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
major step up in terms of performance

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.990 
major step up in terms of performance
over<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.260> iPhone<00:03:16.650> 5s<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.580> video<00:03:17.850> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
over the iPhone 5s and this video is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.550 
over the iPhone 5s and this video is
pretty<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.390> going<00:03:18.600> along<00:03:18.900> those<00:03:19.079> lines<00:03:19.350> as

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
pretty much going along those lines as

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.110 
pretty much going along those lines as
well<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.829> doesn't<00:03:20.010> feel<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.880> much

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
well it doesn't feel like it's that much

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.090 
well it doesn't feel like it's that much
faster<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.260> Apple<00:03:22.380> themselves<00:03:22.950> did

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
faster I think Apple themselves did

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.069 
faster I think Apple themselves did
actually<00:03:23.370> say<00:03:23.549> that<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.880> about<00:03:24.000> 25%<00:03:24.600> more

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
actually say that it's about 25% more

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.199 
actually say that it's about 25% more
powerful<00:03:25.530> than<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.769> iPhone<00:03:26.070> 5s<00:03:26.489> which<00:03:26.880> isn't

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
powerful than the iPhone 5s which isn't

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.850 
powerful than the iPhone 5s which isn't
as<00:03:27.269> big<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> performance<00:03:28.110> gain<00:03:28.350> as<00:03:28.590> what<00:03:28.739> we

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
as big a performance gain as what we

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.590 
as big a performance gain as what we
usually<00:03:29.040> see<00:03:29.400> from<00:03:29.579> Apple<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.390> all<00:03:30.480> in

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
usually see from Apple so all in all in

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300 
usually see from Apple so all in all in
this<00:03:30.750> test<00:03:31.019> these<00:03:31.230> two<00:03:31.290> devices<00:03:31.680> are<00:03:32.040> very

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this test these two devices are very

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.009 
this test these two devices are very
tightly<00:03:32.640> matched<00:03:32.970> which<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.390> very<00:03:33.600> impressive

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
tightly matched which is very impressive

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.750 
tightly matched which is very impressive
for<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.320> Nexus<00:03:34.709> 5<00:03:34.890> considering<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> year

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
for the Nexus 5 considering it's a year

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.160 
for the Nexus 5 considering it's a year
old<00:03:35.910> device<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.840> little<00:03:37.079> bit

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
old device and a little bit

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.270 
old device and a little bit
disappointing<00:03:37.739> for<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.890> iPhone<00:03:38.190> 6

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
disappointing for the iPhone 6

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.220 
disappointing for the iPhone 6
considering<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.299> being<00:03:39.750> released<00:03:40.019> I'm

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
considering it's just being released I'm

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.840 
considering it's just being released I'm
sure<00:03:40.410> loads<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.829> Apple<00:03:41.040> fans<00:03:41.220> were<00:03:41.400> hoping<00:03:41.730> it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
sure loads of Apple fans were hoping it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.400 
sure loads of Apple fans were hoping it
was<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.150> going<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.360> blow<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.750> Nexus<00:03:43.049> 5<00:03:43.230> out

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
was just going to blow the Nexus 5 out

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.170 
was just going to blow the Nexus 5 out
of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> water<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:44.010> terms<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.400> speed<00:03:44.610> but<00:03:45.150> that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
of the water in terms of speed but that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.699 
of the water in terms of speed but that
really<00:03:45.510> didn't<00:03:45.750> happen<00:03:45.780> at<00:03:46.140> least<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.500> terms

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
really didn't happen at least in terms

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.170 
really didn't happen at least in terms
of<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.950> app<00:03:47.040> opening<00:03:47.400> speed<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.790> course<00:03:48.000> I'll

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
of the app opening speed of course I'll

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.910 
of the app opening speed of course I'll
be<00:03:48.299> doing<00:03:48.480> loads<00:03:48.690> more<00:03:48.870> tests<00:03:49.350> like<00:03:49.500> web

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
be doing loads more tests like web

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.590 
be doing loads more tests like web
browser<00:03:50.220> speed<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.850> gaming<00:03:51.180> performance

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
browser speed and gaming performance

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.630 
browser speed and gaming performance
which<00:03:51.750> may<00:03:51.959> hold<00:03:52.200> more<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.860> an<00:03:52.980> advantage<00:03:53.489> so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
which may hold more of an advantage so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.130 
which may hold more of an advantage so
we'll<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.970> wait<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.209> see<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.600> stay

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
we'll have to wait and see on that stay

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.489 
we'll have to wait and see on that stay
tuned<00:03:55.380> guys<00:03:55.470> peace<00:03:56.340> out
