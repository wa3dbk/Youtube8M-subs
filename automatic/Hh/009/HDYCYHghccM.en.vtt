00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
his learning curve and Mike after

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.280 
his learning curve and Mike after
sitting<00:01:07.000> out<00:01:07.060> all<00:01:07.240> its<00:01:07.270> prey<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.990> know<00:01:08.110> Eddie

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
sitting out all its prey you know Eddie

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.260 
sitting out all its prey you know Eddie
I<00:01:08.680> mean<00:01:08.830> he's<00:01:08.950> picked<00:01:09.220> up<00:01:09.370> what<00:01:09.760> we're<00:01:09.940> doing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
I mean he's picked up what we're doing

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
I mean he's picked up what we're doing
and<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.660> been<00:01:10.870> a<00:01:10.900> change<00:01:11.260> he<00:01:11.500> missed<00:01:11.740> spring

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and it's been a change he missed spring

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.090 
and it's been a change he missed spring
so<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:13.870> know<00:01:13.960> he's<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> kinesthetic<00:01:14.710> learner

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
so you know he's a kinesthetic learner

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190 
so you know he's a kinesthetic learner
he's<00:01:15.280> got<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.550> get<00:01:15.640> out<00:01:15.760> there<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.030> do<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.330> you

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
he's got to get out there and do it you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.020 
he's got to get out there and do it you
know<00:01:17.290> he's<00:01:17.440> also<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:18.160> in<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.430> boot<00:01:18.580> for<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.850> long

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
know he's also was in a boot for a long

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.550 
know he's also was in a boot for a long
time<00:01:19.300> throughout<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.750> spring<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.229> summer

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
time throughout the spring and in summer

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.320 
time throughout the spring and in summer
so<00:01:20.830> he's<00:01:21.310> probably<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.820> know<00:01:21.850> not<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.240> great

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
so he's probably you know not in great

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.210 
so he's probably you know not in great
football<00:01:22.780> shape<00:01:23.020> any<00:01:23.320> wise<00:01:23.470> because<00:01:23.890> he<00:01:24.009> was

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
football shape any wise because he was

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.780 
football shape any wise because he was
in<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.430> cast<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:26.040> he's<00:01:27.040> kind<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.340> gaining

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
in a cast so he's kind of gaining

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.320 
in a cast so he's kind of gaining
endurance<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:28.960> go<00:01:30.119> certainly<00:01:31.119> getting<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
endurance as we go certainly getting a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.570 
endurance as we go certainly getting a
lot<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.509> rubs<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.470> he's<00:01:33.220> getting<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.460> better

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
lot of rubs so he's getting a better

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.210 
lot of rubs so he's getting a better
better<00:01:33.820> shape<00:01:34.030> how's<00:01:34.810> Alice<00:01:35.110> tan<00:01:35.290> else<00:01:36.130> is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
better shape how's Alice tan else is

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.280 
better shape how's Alice tan else is
doing<00:01:36.369> fine<00:01:36.580> he's<00:01:36.940> gotten<00:01:37.180> his<00:01:37.270> weight<00:01:37.420> down<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
doing fine he's gotten his weight down I

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.340 
doing fine he's gotten his weight down I
think<00:01:38.890> he's<00:01:39.009> 335<00:01:39.790> he's<00:01:40.720> goal<00:01:40.960> weight<00:01:41.170> and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
think he's 335 he's goal weight and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.719 
think he's 335 he's goal weight and
let's<00:01:41.470> go<00:01:41.619> down<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.830> 325<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.110> he's<00:01:44.290> he's<00:01:44.770> making

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
let's go down to 325 so he's he's making

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.670 
let's go down to 325 so he's he's making
