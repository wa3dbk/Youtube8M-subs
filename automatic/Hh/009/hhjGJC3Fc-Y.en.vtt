00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
been very skeptical to adopt wireless

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
been very skeptical to adopt wireless
with<00:00:39.690> gaming<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> any<00:00:41.309> different<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
with gaming how is this any different so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
with gaming how is this any different so

really nice but you know I still need

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
really nice but you know I still need
gaming<00:00:53.610> performance<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.050> taking<00:00:55.320> on

gaming performance so you know taking on

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.979 
gaming performance so you know taking on
that<00:00:55.800> challenge<00:00:56.270> we<00:00:57.270> were<00:00:57.420> able<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.840> our

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that challenge we were able with our

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.080 
that challenge we were able with our
engineering<00:00:58.410> team<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.010> overcome<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.879> two

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
engineering team to overcome the two

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
engineering team to overcome the two
most<00:01:00.270> important<00:01:00.690> things<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.530> wireless

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
most important things for a wireless

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
most important things for a wireless
product<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> gaming<00:01:03.180> product<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.500> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
product and a gaming product and one is

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.710 
product and a gaming product and one is
latency<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.909> no<00:01:06.119> latency<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.869> lag<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
latency so no latency or lag and two is

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
latency so no latency or lag and two is
power<00:01:09.720> management<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.130> don't<00:01:11.369> want

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
power management right so you don't want

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 
power management right so you don't want
to<00:01:11.610> interrupt<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.570> game<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.560> are

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to interrupt the game that's those are

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
to interrupt the game that's those are
the<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.010> key<00:01:14.400> things<00:01:14.430> yeah<00:01:15.390> definitely<00:01:15.600> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the two key things yeah definitely so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
the two key things yeah definitely so
you<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.229> address<00:01:16.619> those<00:01:16.860> concerns<00:01:17.040> salute

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this mouse yeah so the first thing is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
this mouse yeah so the first thing is
you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> cocktail

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you know really it's kind of a cocktail

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.679 
you know really it's kind of a cocktail
if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:23.130> blue<00:01:23.820> track<00:01:24.119> tracking

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
if you will of our blue track tracking

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.789 
if you will of our blue track tracking
technology<00:01:25.880> with<00:01:26.880> 2.4<00:01:27.659> gigahertz<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
technology with 2.4 gigahertz and a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
technology with 2.4 gigahertz and a
full-speed<00:01:29.369> USB<00:01:29.479> connection<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.320> can

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
full-speed USB connection that we can

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100 
full-speed USB connection that we can
overcome<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.369> latency<00:01:32.909> concerns<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
overcome the latency concerns and and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
overcome the latency concerns and and
this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> bench<00:01:34.650> tested<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:36.030> tested<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this is bench tested and we tested it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.499 
this is bench tested and we tested it
with<00:01:36.960> gamers<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.740> even<00:01:38.159> pro<00:01:38.340> gamers<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.270> urban

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
with gamers and even pro gamers in urban

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.710 
with gamers and even pro gamers in urban
and<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:40.320> were<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.560> able<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.450> see<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.570> there

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and they were not able to see if there

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
and they were not able to see if there
was<00:01:42.780> any<00:01:42.990> latency<00:01:43.409> excellent<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.460> mentioned

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
was any latency excellent you mentioned

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
was any latency excellent you mentioned
a<00:01:44.909> blue<00:01:45.180> track<00:01:45.450> technology<00:01:46.020> something<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
a blue track technology something that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.020 
a blue track technology something that
is<00:01:46.590> new<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.220> maybe<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> should<00:01:47.579> explain<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
is new so maybe you should explain a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.069 
is new so maybe you should explain a
little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.479> about<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> our

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
little bit more about that to our

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
little bit more about that to our
viewers<00:01:49.200> yeah<00:01:49.470> what's<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.280> great<00:01:50.490> about

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
viewers yeah what's really great about

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.149 
viewers yeah what's really great about
the<00:01:50.820> blue<00:01:50.970> track<00:01:51.210> technology<00:01:52.159> specifically

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the blue track technology specifically

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.940 
the blue track technology specifically
for<00:01:53.460> gaming<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.000> our<00:01:54.810> engineers<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.530> able<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
for gaming is our engineers are able to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
for gaming is our engineers are able to
really<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.820> were<00:01:56.880> able<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.240> tweak

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
really you know they were able to tweak

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
really you know they were able to tweak
and<00:01:57.930> tune<00:01:58.200> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> sports<00:01:59.340> car

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and tune kind of like a sports car

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.940 
and tune kind of like a sports car
engine<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> will<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.200> frame<00:02:01.500> rate<00:02:01.740> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
engine if you will the frame rate of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.120 
engine if you will the frame rate of
this<00:02:02.070> mouse<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:03.229> 13,000<00:02:04.229> frames<00:02:04.469> per<00:02:04.710> second

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
this mouse is 13,000 frames per second

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.059 
this mouse is 13,000 frames per second
so<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> means<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.649> tracking

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so what that means is that the tracking

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.880 
so what that means is that the tracking
engines<00:02:08.399> taking<00:02:09.200> 13,000<00:02:10.200> pictures<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
engines taking 13,000 pictures of the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
engines taking 13,000 pictures of the
mouse<00:02:11.039> surface<00:02:11.520> per<00:02:11.760> second<00:02:12.209> that's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
mouse surface per second that's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.870 
mouse surface per second that's
two<00:02:12.900> times<00:02:13.170> more<00:02:13.349> than<00:02:13.530> any<00:02:13.739> gaming<00:02:14.370> mouse<00:02:14.670> out

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
two times more than any gaming mouse out

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.430 
two times more than any gaming mouse out
there<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> market<00:02:15.569> right<00:02:15.690> now<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.200> it's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
there in the market right now so it's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.290 
there in the market right now so it's
just<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:17.190> accurate<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.910> precise

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
just really accurate and precise

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.030 
just really accurate and precise
excellent<00:02:19.230> good<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.440> know<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.950> have

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
excellent good to know you have to have

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.890 
excellent good to know you have to have
a<00:02:20.069> precise<00:02:20.430> mouse<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:21.209> very<00:02:21.420> important

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
a precise mouse also very important

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.420 
a precise mouse also very important
obviously<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> form<00:02:22.739> factor<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.220> kind<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
obviously is the form factor and kind of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.010 
obviously is the form factor and kind of
the<00:02:23.489> design<00:02:23.849> watch<00:02:24.330> through<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> design<00:02:24.959> of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the design watch through the design of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.500 
the design watch through the design of
it<00:02:25.170> yeah<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.610> mouse<00:02:26.760> has<00:02:27.000> seven

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it yeah so the the mouse has seven

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.530 
it yeah so the the mouse has seven
programmable<00:02:28.110> buttons<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.550> two<00:02:29.610> side<00:02:30.120> buttons

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
programmable buttons so two side buttons

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900 
programmable buttons so two side buttons
the<00:02:30.870> left<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:31.680> main<00:02:32.099> buttons<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the left and right main buttons the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.820 
the left and right main buttons the
scroll<00:02:33.180> wheel<00:02:33.209> has<00:02:33.569> tilt<00:02:33.930> left<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
scroll wheel has tilt left and right and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.800 
scroll wheel has tilt left and right and
down<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.150> total<00:02:36.330> seven

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
down so that's a total seven

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
down so that's a total seven
programmable<00:02:37.349> options<00:02:37.830> you'll<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:38.610> some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
programmable options you'll see some

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.470 
programmable options you'll see some
other<00:02:38.940> buttons<00:02:39.330> here<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.870> top<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> for

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
other buttons here on top so this is for

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.050 
other buttons here on top so this is for
on-the-fly<00:02:42.480> dpi<00:02:43.319> switching<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.819> mouse

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
on-the-fly dpi switching so this mouse

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.960 
on-the-fly dpi switching so this mouse
can<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:45.480> from<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.870> low<00:02:46.019> as<00:02:46.140> 250<00:02:46.950> dpi<00:02:47.549> that's

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
can go from as low as 250 dpi that's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
can go from as low as 250 dpi that's
dots<00:02:48.209> per<00:02:48.450> inch<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> 4,000

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
dots per inch all the way up to 4,000

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.520 
dots per inch all the way up to 4,000
and<00:02:50.549> that's<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.390> how<00:02:51.569> fast<00:02:51.900> your<00:02:52.140> cursor

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and that's that's how fast your cursor

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.259 
and that's that's how fast your cursor
moves<00:02:52.769> across<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.100> screen<00:02:53.549> relative<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.180> your

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
moves across a screen relative to your

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.090 
moves across a screen relative to your
hand<00:02:54.510> movement<00:02:54.959> that's<00:02:55.290> really<00:02:55.470> important<00:02:55.950> in

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
hand movement that's really important in

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.680 
hand movement that's really important in
game<00:02:56.310> especially<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.269> even<00:02:57.420> some

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
game especially you know even some

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
shooters you might be playing at a mid

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.430 
shooters you might be playing at a mid
dpi<00:03:00.000> level<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.630> when<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.840> pick<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.200> sniper
