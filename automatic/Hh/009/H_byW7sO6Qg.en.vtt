00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.250
 but with a little disappointment by 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.720
 relation to this result or satisfaction 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.070
 to open the world to 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.660
 mitigated here are mixed feelings have 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.080
 satisfied for the players so because 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 that I think that here it is 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 the point so here we are going to do good 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 starts at least the season but we do not 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.270
 can not be satisfied with the second half 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.920
 time we produced we had too much 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.300
 waste and therefore too much waste I have not 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.190
 recognized our team in the lack of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.800
 mastery in the country must also say 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.910
 that our triangle today is I 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.769
 think there is fatigue we had 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.379
 delay in the face of a good cleaning 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.180
 the nyon team let second mi 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.019
 time we felt a little better in 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.420
 the last twenty minutes anyway 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.710
 you could have taken an advantage 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.530
 yes we can take the advantage but 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.909
 we did not do it well I think we 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.940
 can not be there we can not be 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.479
 fully satisfied with this match 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.110
 so here and a yurt is we have 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.020
 well pressed 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.610
 I think I was expecting better from this 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.950
 better year of our team so under the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.659
 pressure we can be as I place 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 the bar is too high here I pass the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.930
 bar too high and too demanding so 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.330
 compared to what we can do 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.770
 so for the moment so we're going to 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.970
 content with this point and work 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.390
 continue to work to try to 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.810
 progress 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.280
 Inca psychologically it can help yes 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 good it can help on any case I 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.320
 hope cyriac mixed feelings after 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.700
 that draw in niort the hac could have 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.690
 to win the hac could also have 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.050
 lose in the last moments of 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.150
 match 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.270
 yeah mixed because we open the scoring 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.869
 we put 1 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.490
 a nice goal on this decree so that's it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.490
 it's never obvious here with the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.670
 displacement which is very long 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.020
 mixed it is clear that we could have 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.179
 win it as lose it as in the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 end as you said so here we are 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.009
 leave with a point and we're going 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.630
 to train and see what has not been 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.420
 good as ten days ago in which the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 did a good first half-time was 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 put in trouble in second what is it 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 it's still tired no I think 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.610
 Fatigue is what is said as 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.590
 the coach I think to demonstrate 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.270
 more calm in the ascent of the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.710
 balloon in the management 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 here is running them I think he 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.180
 did we make it a bit too easy to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.740
 balloon and make running them do 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.110
 run simply wrong that it takes 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.300
 that the galley team when when we have the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
 ball and we made it a little bit too 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.780
 easily today on a plane 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 staff a come back into play in 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.530
 somewhat painful circumstances with the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 exit on injury from zargo not too much 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 difficult to enter this context 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.680
 we do not know that at this position we are asking 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.990
 that can happen at any time so 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.330
 this is jargon that's good and it's a blow 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.890
 he was not much afraid of it 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.000
 bench we feared a little bit and that's 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.160
 hard so much better for him 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.150
 I was ready here in my head I 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.460
 think it went well 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.050
 Parisian point of the draw but 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.950
 it was the hacker the king the score but 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.270
 it could have brought them 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.740
 it could have turned in a sense like 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.060
 in another at the end of the match but it's 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.310
 true that in the end it's like it's 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.560
 difficult and then push with the support 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.730
 their audience is starting to be very very 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.860
 difficult they have some opportunities 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.600
 hit the bar at the end we opened 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.960
 the score we could not keep the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.240
 result 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.590
 but good to be the point of the match 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.110
 null so that is positive that a 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.730
 father for a transverse to the 94th 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.440
 minute but it would have been unfair to 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.880
 see the ball enter the bus 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.720
 it's true that it would have been unfair 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.300
 we were very bad 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.920
 an island content of the match it's true that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.380
 we have not been very efficient 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.520
 today but hey we're doing well 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.530
 still with the points of the match and 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.970
 saw the action that rings and in the end we 're going 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.800
 go out a step away 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.390
 in trouble in the second period having 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.160
 hard to be forced to play at very 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.480
 very low it is true that we disfigure in 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.950
 second period they consume close 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.600
 it's high enough it's true we had 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.000
 hard to find in bones heart of the 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.170
 game like it's our game but we had 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.470
 hard to apply the instructions of the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.660
 trainer 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.420
 so it's more relying on hindsight 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
 we are in a hurry a lot fifth 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.750
 appearance in league 2 from a point of view 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.460
 first staff this season 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.770
 do me good it feels good 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.270
 always but the most important is 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.710
 to be a big regret if the coach does 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.600
 call me it's up to me to be present 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.920
 I try to answer this and more 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.040
 here but what to think of this point brought back 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.240
 decided to listen to it is already a 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.640
 good corner that got me first points of the 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.790
 championship so it's good to have 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.830
 unlocked the meter after after we can 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.780
 we can be a little disappointed because 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.240
 that we can bring back the three points 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.740
 also because 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 we are we have done a good 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.539
 first half well in place well 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.160
 defensively they have posed some 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.169
 problems in the ascent 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.569
 they played well the pressing they have 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.009
 in a hurry and that's what they did 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.690
 they resort they continued there 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.979
 above in the second half and they have 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.970
 well pushed until they have this 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.710
 which marks that they equalize 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.160
 we took over a little bit at the end of 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.009
 match but ultimately in the end it's in 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.210
 remaining a draw when we 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.000
 find anyway with a point we are 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470
 we are still quite satisfied with you 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.449
 tickle a little where you 're criticized a 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.210
 little before this match in 10 years we 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.139
 was not completely in the rhythm 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.370
 for the first two games and then 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.550
 well, you take a good match and 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.830
 and then you mark yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.970
 it is brief me I felt good it is 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.889
 what we said we had said that me 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.849
 a good me I felt good but that's it 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.740
 that's where it's paid work and I 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.970
 meaning well argos argol has unscrewed what 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.380
 is that we work that kind 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.580
 from corner cause to practice that 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.039
 I 'm a little forgotten at 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.569
 second and it pays it makes a match 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.659
 so that's great for the team 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:33.340
 it was two years and eleven days not 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:35.560
 marked yeah that's right it's good 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.360
 it's a pleasure and why not I hope 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.020
 two goals in the season it would be a 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.090
 that would be great 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.740
 his daughter very normal this point anyway 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.270
 to open the points counter yeah yeah 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.560
 it's sure it's good 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.180
 it's true we had to owe 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.960
 least bring back a point already do not 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.860
 lose to niort that for the trust for 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.260
 continue to improve the maybe 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.380
 points taken at home against nancy 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.810
 maybe so now it's done 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.880
 well it's sure we'll be able to 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.920
 work again this week and like 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.310
 I said bonuses improved maybe this 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.310
 customer point
