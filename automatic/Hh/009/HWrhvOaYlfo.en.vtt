00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
natural walkway in the house so it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.600 
natural walkway in the house so it
couldn't<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.030> wider<00:01:56.300> than<00:01:56.599> 22<00:01:56.840> inches<00:01:57.679> to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
really make the tank an upgrade and they

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.770 
really make the tank an upgrade and they
get<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:00.470> water<00:02:00.649> wall<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:01.099> wanted<00:02:01.429> a<00:02:01.640> 72<00:02:02.539> by

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
get the water wall and we wanted a 72 by

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.040 
get the water wall and we wanted a 72 by
22<00:02:03.380> by<00:02:03.619> 30<00:02:03.979> inch<00:02:04.280> tank<00:02:04.640> was<00:02:04.819> selected<00:02:05.330> that

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
22 by 30 inch tank was selected that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.320 
22 by 30 inch tank was selected that
comes<00:02:06.349> out<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:06.739> 206<00:02:07.670> gallons

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
comes out to about 206 gallons

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.540 
comes out to about 206 gallons
plenty<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.349> aquariums<00:02:09.709> built<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.130> tank<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
plenty of aquariums built the tank and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.210 
plenty of aquariums built the tank and
it<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.729> built<00:02:11.060> well<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.840> tank<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.620> don't

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it was built well like a tank I don't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.679 
it was built well like a tank I don't
think<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.489> could<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.700> survived<00:02:14.030> dropping

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
think it could have survived dropping

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.360 
think it could have survived dropping
though<00:02:14.870> which<00:02:15.260> almost<00:02:15.620> happened<00:02:15.950> right<00:02:16.129> here

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
though which almost happened right here

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
though which almost happened right here
