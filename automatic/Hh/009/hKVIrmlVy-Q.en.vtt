but instead of using egg I actually used

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
but instead of using egg I actually used
hemp<00:01:19.140> seeds<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> grind<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.820> hemp

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
hemp seeds and when you grind the hemp

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.249 
hemp seeds and when you grind the hemp
seeds<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.350> become<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:23.070> rich<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
creamy and they really can take on the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
creamy and they really can take on the
consistency<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> egg<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:28.860> great<00:01:29.009> egg
