00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340 

just<00:00:00.659> for<00:00:00.840> fun<00:00:01.050> I'll<00:00:01.380> make<00:00:01.740> another<00:00:02.010> propeller

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:03.350 
just for fun I'll make another propeller

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:13.910 
just for fun I'll make another propeller
using<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.910> cork<00:00:05.910> bottle<00:00:06.450> top<00:00:12.920> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
using this cork bottle top this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.310 
using this cork bottle top this
particular<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.730> has<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:16.100> plastic

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
particular one has got little plastic

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
particular one has got little plastic
rips<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> way<00:00:19.830> right<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.220> inside<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
rips all the way right in the inside to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
rips all the way right in the inside to
hold<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.330> cork<00:00:22.050> into<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.619> plastic<00:00:23.100> top<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
hold the cork into the plastic top so I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
hold the cork into the plastic top so I
should<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.279> able<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.970> mark<00:00:31.610> two<00:00:32.610> opposite

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
should be able to just mark two opposite

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:55.110 
should be able to just mark two opposite
sides<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.649> saves<00:00:35.370> me<00:00:35.520> measuring

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.060 

so<00:00:55.750> we<00:00:55.870> need<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.200> cut<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:57.030> slot<00:00:58.030> on<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:58.830> on<00:00:59.830> each

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
so we need to cut a slot on that on each

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.850 
so we need to cut a slot on that on each
side<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.980> we<00:01:03.130> can<00:01:03.370> push<00:01:04.059> some<00:01:04.860> cardboard

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
side that we can push some cardboard

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.390 
side that we can push some cardboard
propellers<00:01:06.610> into<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.990> start<00:01:11.410> there<00:01:11.740> go

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
propellers into so we start there go

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.240 
propellers into so we start there go
down<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.940> there<00:01:13.150> somewhere

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.350 

and<00:01:20.850> turn<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:24.300> do<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.540> same<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
and turn it around and do the same I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:42.750 
and turn it around and do the same I
head<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:27.990> somewhere

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760 

I'm<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.540> trying<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.960> align<00:01:44.260> where<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
I'm just trying to align where the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.620 
I'm just trying to align where the
center<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.250> by<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:46.290> give<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> guess<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:49.390> need<00:01:49.540> to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
center is by I give a guess we need to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.330 
center is by I give a guess we need to
make<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.810> hole<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.350> center<00:01:50.860> as<00:01:50.950> well<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
make a hole in the center as well so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.920 
make a hole in the center as well so
that<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.730> push<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.060> on<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.450> shaft<00:01:55.480> of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
that we can push it on to the shaft of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.440 
that we can push it on to the shaft of
the<00:01:55.990> motor<00:01:56.080> just<00:01:57.090> cut<00:01:58.090> my<00:01:58.300> propeller<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the motor just cut my propeller out of a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.150 
the motor just cut my propeller out of a
piece<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.690> card<00:02:02.080> or<00:02:02.740> cut<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.730> in<00:02:03.820> half<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.770> then

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
piece of card or cut it in half and then

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.490 
piece of card or cut it in half and then
push<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.610> into<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.510> slots<00:02:07.870> when<00:02:08.140> I've<00:02:08.260> cut

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
push it into the slots when I've cut

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.550 
push it into the slots when I've cut
them<00:02:09.450> got<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.540> mains<00:02:10.750> power<00:02:10.960> off<00:02:11.380> at<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
them got the mains power off at the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.710 
them got the mains power off at the
moment<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.310> can't<00:02:12.610> use<00:02:12.820> all<00:02:12.970> my<00:02:13.150> lights<00:02:15.720> but

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
moment so I can't use all my lights but

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.770 
moment so I can't use all my lights but
we<00:02:16.780> should<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.080> able<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.410> well<00:02:17.590> enough<00:02:18.780> so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
we should be able to see well enough so

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:43.860 
we should be able to see well enough so
I<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.020> need<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.290> cut<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.740> bit

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:03:11.830 

same<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> other<00:02:44.800> side

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.559 

so<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:12.989> our<00:03:13.230> basic<00:03:13.920> propeller<00:03:14.489> might<00:03:15.390> need

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
so that's our basic propeller might need

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.600 
so that's our basic propeller might need
to<00:03:15.720> glue<00:03:15.930> those<00:03:16.170> in<00:03:16.440> stop<00:03:16.920> them<00:03:17.069> flying<00:03:17.370> out

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
to glue those in stop them flying out

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.970 
to glue those in stop them flying out
when<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:17.909> going<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:19.500> drill<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> small

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
when it's going on these drill a small

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.009 
when it's going on these drill a small
hole<00:03:20.129> down<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.670> middle<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.569> on<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:21.780> shaft

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
hole down the middle to go on the shaft

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.490 
hole down the middle to go on the shaft
of<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.319> motor<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:23.480> guess<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.720> probably<00:03:24.930> cut

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:04:26.190 

the<00:03:28.500> propeller<00:03:28.890> off<00:03:29.099> about<00:03:29.670> here<00:03:29.970> somewhere

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.740 

if<00:04:27.200> you've<00:04:27.380> got<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> proper<00:04:28.040> drill<00:04:28.700> press<00:04:29.090> then

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
if you've got a proper drill press then

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.210 
if you've got a proper drill press then
that'd<00:04:30.050> be<00:04:30.170> much<00:04:30.350> better<00:04:30.590> way<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.770> doing<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.190> to

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
that'd be much better way of doing it to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.430 
that'd be much better way of doing it to
make<00:04:31.400> sure<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.580> get<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> hole<00:04:32.140> at<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.170> right

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
make sure you get the hole at the right

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.030 
make sure you get the hole at the right
angle<00:04:33.890> or<00:04:34.070> straight<00:04:34.670> being<00:04:35.210> exact<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:36.040> don't

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
angle or straight being exact I don't

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.680 
angle or straight being exact I don't
have<00:04:37.250> one<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:37.850> we'll<00:04:38.060> just<00:04:38.210> have<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.360> put<00:04:38.570> up

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
have one so we'll just have to put up

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.390 
have one so we'll just have to put up
with<00:04:38.870> it<00:04:38.990> being<00:04:39.170> possibly<00:04:39.680> off-center<00:04:40.370> and

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
with it being possibly off-center and

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.390 
with it being possibly off-center and
out<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.820> balance<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:42.380> won't<00:04:42.590> matter<00:04:42.800> just

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
out of balance that won't matter just

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.220 
out of balance that won't matter just
for<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> toy<00:04:44.090> car<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.690> we're<00:04:44.840> going<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.020> use

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
for the toy car that we're going to use

00:04:45.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
for the toy car that we're going to use
our<00:04:45.380> for<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.940> that's<00:05:14.120> our<00:05:14.270> propeller

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.390 

right<00:06:11.450> ready<00:06:12.450> to<00:06:12.660> test<00:06:12.870> it<00:06:13.080> we<00:06:13.920> better<00:06:14.070> just

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
right ready to test it we better just

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:39.420 
right ready to test it we better just
give<00:06:14.550> it<00:06:14.670> a<00:06:14.730> test<00:06:14.970> run<00:06:15.270> with<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.480> new<00:06:15.690> propeller

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.460 

so<00:06:40.430> there<00:06:40.610> we<00:06:40.730> go<00:06:40.940> a<00:06:43.180> cardboard<00:06:44.180> and<00:06:44.720> cork

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
so there we go a cardboard and cork

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.190 
so there we go a cardboard and cork
propeller
