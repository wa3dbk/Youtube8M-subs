for me I'm a little behind weather when
it<00:02:35.300> comes<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.540> spring<00:02:35.720> break<00:02:35.900> my<00:02:36.410> school<00:02:36.680> has

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
it comes to spring break my school has

it comes to spring break my school has
it<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.160> little<00:02:37.310> differently<00:02:37.700> because<00:02:37.880> we<00:02:38.150> have

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
it a little differently because we have

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.760 
it a little differently because we have
something<00:02:38.390> called<00:02:38.540> ski<00:02:38.810> week<00:02:38.960> which<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.590> two

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
something called ski week which is two

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.410 
something called ski week which is two
weeks<00:02:39.950> before<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.520> basically<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.030> week<00:02:41.240> off

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
weeks before it's basically so week off

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.240 
weeks before it's basically so week off
so<00:02:42.140> that's<00:02:42.320> why<00:02:42.470> they<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.160> they

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
so that's why they do that so they

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250 
so that's why they do that so they
wanted<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.610> separate<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.240> bit<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.900> hopefully

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
wanted to separate it a bit so hopefully

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.840 
wanted to separate it a bit so hopefully
