00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.309 
interesting mechanic to keep in mind I
guess<00:06:25.710> let<00:06:26.669> me<00:06:26.759> come<00:06:26.940> back<00:06:26.969> up<00:06:27.240> here<00:06:27.270> feel<00:06:28.199> like

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
guess let me come back up here feel like

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.100 
guess let me come back up here feel like
someone's<00:06:28.620> gonna<00:06:28.800> slap<00:06:29.069> me<00:06:29.250> that<00:06:30.000> oh<00:06:30.180> no<00:06:30.629> I<00:06:30.779> got

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
someone's gonna slap me that oh no I got

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.959 
someone's gonna slap me that oh no I got
slaps<00:06:31.379> see<00:06:31.770> that<00:06:31.949> because<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:32.490> could<00:06:32.639> see<00:06:32.849> the

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
slaps see that because you could see the

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.790 
slaps see that because you could see the
tower<00:06:33.180> moving<00:06:33.630> away<00:06:33.810> that's<00:06:33.990> a<00:06:34.110> perfect<00:06:34.529> idea

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
tower moving away that's a perfect idea

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.879 
tower moving away that's a perfect idea
of<00:06:34.830> just<00:06:35.580> showing<00:06:35.909> you<00:06:36.120> how<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.360> works<00:06:36.889> it's

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
of just showing you how it works it's

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:38.959 
of just showing you how it works it's
literally<00:06:38.250> just<00:06:38.310> you<00:06:38.580> fly

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
literally just you fly

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:41.719 
literally just you fly
off<00:06:39.589> imagine<00:06:40.589> getting<00:06:40.709> hit<00:06:40.949> that<00:06:41.159> is<00:06:41.369> it's<00:06:41.639> not

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
off imagine getting hit that is it's not

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.049 
off imagine getting hit that is it's not
back<00:06:42.149> but<00:06:42.389> just<00:06:42.599> insanely<00:06:43.409> long<00:06:43.889> and<00:06:44.249> then<00:06:44.969> you

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
back but just insanely long and then you

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.089 
back but just insanely long and then you
fall<00:06:45.239> into<00:06:45.419> them<00:06:45.599> then<00:06:45.749> what<00:06:46.289> did<00:06:46.649> I<00:06:46.799> say<00:06:46.979> the

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
fall into them then what did I say the

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.259 
fall into them then what did I say the
nether<00:06:47.399> Wow

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:48.269 
nether Wow

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.529 
nether Wow
into<00:06:48.959> the<00:06:49.349> void<00:06:49.709> but<00:06:50.429> are<00:06:50.579> very<00:06:50.789> very<00:06:50.999> fun<00:06:51.179> very

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
into the void but are very very fun very

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.569 
into the void but are very very fun very
simple<00:06:52.199> mechanic<00:06:52.679> as<00:06:52.799> you<00:06:52.919> probably<00:06:53.129> gathered

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:53.579 
simple mechanic as you probably gathered

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.129 
simple mechanic as you probably gathered
but<00:06:54.119> you<00:06:54.179> can<00:06:54.299> do<00:06:54.389> a<00:06:54.479> lot<00:06:54.569> of<00:06:54.599> fun<00:06:54.779> stuff<00:06:54.959> with

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
but you can do a lot of fun stuff with

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.719 
but you can do a lot of fun stuff with
