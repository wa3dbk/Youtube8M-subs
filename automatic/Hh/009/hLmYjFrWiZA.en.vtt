00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
cycled that that'll come right off they

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.110 
cycled that that'll come right off they
either<00:02:58.129> hang<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.609> top

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
either hang on the top

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.800 
either hang on the top
I<00:02:59.150> think<00:02:59.959> that'll<00:03:00.230> give<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.469> nice<00:03:00.650> look<00:03:00.950> Oh

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
I think that'll give it a nice look Oh

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.629 
I think that'll give it a nice look Oh
looking<00:03:02.810> at<00:03:02.930> here<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.500> uh<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:05.299> rock<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:06.079> as<00:03:06.889> as

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
looking at here is uh this rock as as as

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.399 
looking at here is uh this rock as as as
you<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.909> see<00:03:08.090> us<00:03:08.209> holding<00:03:08.389> down<00:03:08.720> my<00:03:08.780> driftwood

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
you can see us holding down my driftwood

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.610 
you can see us holding down my driftwood
I<00:03:10.269> soaked<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:11.480> apparently<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.049> didn't<00:03:12.319> soak<00:03:12.470> it

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I soaked it apparently I didn't soak it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.990 
I soaked it apparently I didn't soak it
enough<00:03:12.889> I<00:03:13.329> was<00:03:14.329> setting<00:03:14.750> up<00:03:15.639> and<00:03:16.639> she's

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
enough I was setting up and she's

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.849 
enough I was setting up and she's
doubted<00:03:17.329> to<00:03:17.389> get<00:03:17.510> away<00:03:17.599> from<00:03:17.720> me<00:03:18.079> started<00:03:18.769> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
doubted to get away from me started the

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.920 
doubted to get away from me started the
float<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.730> thought<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.269> was<00:03:20.389> alright<00:03:20.689> I<00:03:20.720> had<00:03:20.900> to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
float I I thought I was alright I had to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.309 
float I I thought I was alright I had to
buried<00:03:21.409> rocks<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.870> substrate<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:23.959> whatnot

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
buried rocks and substrate and whatnot

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.099 
buried rocks and substrate and whatnot
but<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:25.400> course<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:27.459> had<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.579> top<00:03:28.970> wedged<00:03:29.840> under

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
but of course I had the top wedged under

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.809 
but of course I had the top wedged under
the<00:03:30.200> lip<00:03:30.439> of<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.620> tank<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.189> that<00:03:31.340> was<00:03:31.459> working

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
the lip of the tank so that was working

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.240 
the lip of the tank so that was working
out<00:03:31.939> good<00:03:32.319> but<00:03:33.319> as<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.530> can<00:03:33.650> see<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.069> way<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
out good but as you can see the way I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.280 
out good but as you can see the way I
got<00:03:34.549> this<00:03:34.699> angle<00:03:35.180> die<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.359> wanted<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:35.900> angle<00:03:36.199> it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
got this angle die I wanted to angle it

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.050 
got this angle die I wanted to angle it
that<00:03:36.440> way<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:36.859> of<00:03:36.979> course<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.519> drawback<00:03:37.699> to

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
that way but of course the drawback to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.240 
that way but of course the drawback to
that<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.479> the<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.409> whole<00:03:39.560> bottom<00:03:40.040> just

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
that is the the whole bottom just

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.000 
that is the the whole bottom just
started<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:41.449> just<00:03:41.659> kicked<00:03:42.139> right<00:03:42.470> out<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.919> I

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
started it just kicked right out and I

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.729 
started it just kicked right out and I
hit<00:03:43.489> my<00:03:43.519> other<00:03:43.879> one<00:03:44.120> mind<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> I'm<00:03:45.019> sitting<00:03:45.650> it

the lights co2 is on a timer and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.670 
the lights co2 is on a timer and
I<00:04:14.950> was<00:04:15.950> messing<00:04:16.280> with<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.730> right<00:04:17.000> here

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
I was messing with this right here

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.229 
I was messing with this right here
anybody<00:04:18.680> who's<00:04:18.980> familiar<00:04:19.190> with<00:04:19.550> the<00:04:19.850> Ehime

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
anybody who's familiar with the Ehime

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.610 
anybody who's familiar with the Ehime
would<00:04:20.480> probably<00:04:20.780> look<00:04:20.870> at<00:04:21.050> this<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.380> say<00:04:21.470> hey

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
would probably look at this and say hey

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.070 
would probably look at this and say hey
he's<00:04:21.800> got<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:22.070> backwards<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.970> mean<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.930> only

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
he's got it backwards I mean the only

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.170 
he's got it backwards I mean the only
thing<00:04:24.170> is<00:04:24.380> backward<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.700> spout

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
thing is backward is the the spout

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.010 
thing is backward is the the spout
itself<00:04:26.950> reason<00:04:27.950> being<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.550> such<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> deep<00:04:29.660> tank

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
itself reason being is such a deep tank

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.430 
itself reason being is such a deep tank
I<00:04:30.230> wanted<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.590> get<00:04:30.740> some<00:04:30.890> flow<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:32.170> think<00:04:33.170> I<00:04:33.260> got

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
I wanted to get some flow I think I got

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.760 
I wanted to get some flow I think I got
decent<00:04:33.830> flow<00:04:34.130> going<00:04:34.550> on<00:04:35.380> if<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.650> have

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
decent flow going on if I would have

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.230 
decent flow going on if I would have
done<00:04:36.920> it<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.160> you're<00:04:37.430> supposed<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:38.090> it

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
done it the way you're supposed to it

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.030 
done it the way you're supposed to it
would<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.450> been<00:04:38.540> way<00:04:38.720> up<00:04:38.900> top<00:04:39.170> here<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.680> I

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
would have been way up top here and I

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.410 
would have been way up top here and I
wanted<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.340> bring<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.640> down<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.090> bring<00:04:41.300> it

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
wanted to bring it down so I bring it

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.660 
wanted to bring it down so I bring it
down<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.810> brought<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.170> down<00:04:42.200> here<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:43.550> it's

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
down I brought it down here and it's

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.170 
down I brought it down here and it's
actually<00:04:43.880> right<00:04:44.360> above<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:45.610> co2<00:04:46.610> diffuser

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
actually right above the co2 diffuser

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.990 
actually right above the co2 diffuser
and<00:04:47.890> it's<00:04:48.890> coming<00:04:49.220> right<00:04:49.250> up<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.850> just

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
and it's coming right up and just

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.150 
and it's coming right up and just
blowing<00:04:50.540> all<00:04:50.810> over<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.110> place<00:04:51.170> yeah<00:04:54.160> let's

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
blowing all over the place yeah let's

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.360 
blowing all over the place yeah let's
say<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:55.490> diffusing<00:04:55.970> pretty<00:04:56.180> good<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:57.190> got<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
say it's diffusing pretty good I got I

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.770 
say it's diffusing pretty good I got I
got<00:04:58.610> co2<00:04:59.030> bubbles<00:04:59.180> going<00:04:59.570> everywhere<00:05:01.270> but

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.360 

probably<00:05:05.780> mess<00:05:06.110> with<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.410> some<00:05:06.590> more<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:07.280> I

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
probably mess with it some more like I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.410 
probably mess with it some more like I
said<00:05:07.610> I'd<00:05:07.670> hook<00:05:07.790> up<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.030> pH<00:05:08.330> controller<00:05:08.780> and

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
said I'd hook up to pH controller and

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.090 
said I'd hook up to pH controller and
well<00:05:11.420> I<00:05:11.450> still<00:05:12.380> gotta<00:05:12.500> do<00:05:12.650> something<00:05:12.980> in<00:05:13.040> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
well I still gotta do something in the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.880 
well I still gotta do something in the
middle<00:05:13.370> here<00:05:13.520> I'm<00:05:13.610> not<00:05:13.760> quite<00:05:14.030> sure<00:05:14.890> that

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
middle here I'm not quite sure that

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.070 
middle here I'm not quite sure that
valve<00:05:16.220> will<00:05:16.490> grow<00:05:16.850> up<00:05:16.880> and<00:05:17.390> kind<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.690> cover<00:05:17.900> the

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
valve will grow up and kind of cover the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.440 
valve will grow up and kind of cover the
heater<00:05:18.230> a<00:05:18.410> little<00:05:18.680> bit<00:05:18.890> but<00:05:19.160> I<00:05:19.400> was<00:05:20.270> thinking

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
heater a little bit but I was thinking

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.600 
heater a little bit but I was thinking
uh<00:05:22.180> somebody<00:05:23.180> else<00:05:23.270> mentioned<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.780> another

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
uh somebody else mentioned to another

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.270 
uh somebody else mentioned to another
some<00:05:25.610> kind<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:25.850> plant<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.330> don't<00:05:26.510> know<00:05:26.600> I<00:05:27.280> figure

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
some kind of plant I don't know I figure

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.890 
some kind of plant I don't know I figure
it<00:05:28.430> out<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.610> thought<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.390> did<00:05:29.660> all<00:05:29.780> right

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
it out I thought I did all right

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.490 
it out I thought I did all right
considering<00:05:31.600> what<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.630> plan<00:05:32.930> a<00:05:32.960> lot<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.320> time

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
considering what a plan a lot of time

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.210 
considering what a plan a lot of time
it's<00:05:33.740> not<00:05:33.890> like<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.100> threw<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.460> together<00:05:34.580> but

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
it's not like I threw it together but

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.410 
it's not like I threw it together but
you<00:05:37.220> can<00:05:37.250> always<00:05:37.490> find<00:05:37.820> 200<00:05:38.300> afterwards

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:50.610 

anyways

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.379 

and<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.190> messed<00:05:51.460> around<00:05:51.580> I've<00:05:51.850> had<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.210> going

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
and I messed around I've had that going

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.000 
and I messed around I've had that going
for<00:05:52.630> a<00:05:52.660> while<00:05:52.840> but<00:05:53.139> I<00:05:53.169> actually<00:05:53.620> tore<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:53.980> down

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
for a while but I actually tore it down

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.460 
for a while but I actually tore it down
the<00:05:54.310> smaller<00:05:54.639> and<00:05:54.850> took<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.810> gravel<00:05:56.230> out<00:05:56.350> and

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
the smaller and took the gravel out and

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.250 
the smaller and took the gravel out and
I<00:05:56.500> put<00:05:56.710> some<00:05:56.740> some<00:05:57.550> left<00:05:57.760> over<00:05:58.120> eco<00:05:58.870> complete

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
I put some some left over eco complete

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.990 
I put some some left over eco complete
on<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.440> bottom<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.070> cap<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.520> off<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.639> gravel

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
on the bottom and I cap it off a gravel

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.920 
on the bottom and I cap it off a gravel
all<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.840> is<00:06:02.050> peace<00:06:02.710> lilies<00:06:03.160> and<00:06:03.370> some
