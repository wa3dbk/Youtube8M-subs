00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.529 

it's<00:02:03.950> very<00:02:04.479> gummy

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.010 

in<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.390> way

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.690 

it<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.680> somehow<00:02:42.040> similar<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.850> durian<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:44.350> know

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
it is somehow similar to durian you know

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.559 
it is somehow similar to durian you know
in<00:02:45.700> terms<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.920> fermented<00:02:47.920> taste

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
in terms of fermented taste

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.100 
in terms of fermented taste
channel

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.490 

yeah

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
yeah

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.929 
yeah
we<00:02:58.770> had<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> great<00:02:59.250> pretty<00:02:59.610> wrong

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
we had a great pretty wrong

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.940 
we had a great pretty wrong
you<00:03:02.239> can<00:03:02.390> do<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.620> would<00:03:03.709> dry

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
you can do it and I think this would dry

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.690 
you can do it and I think this would dry
you<00:03:04.849> get<00:03:04.939> your<00:03:05.120> hands<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.420> breadfruit<00:03:06.129> but

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
you get your hands on a breadfruit but

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.600 
you get your hands on a breadfruit but
I<00:03:08.790> will<00:03:09.480> definitely<00:03:09.930> not<00:03:10.190> make<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> meal<00:03:11.489> of

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
I will definitely not make a meal of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.250 
I will definitely not make a meal of
that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
I don't think I'm going to finish it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.030 
I don't think I'm going to finish it
actually<00:03:17.140> I'll<00:03:18.140> probably<00:03:18.439> give<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.950> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
actually I'll probably give it to the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.990 
actually I'll probably give it to the
dogs

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
