here<00:02:30.490> pull<00:02:31.490> something<00:02:31.940> up<00:02:32.470> got<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> FM<00:02:33.770> radio

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
here pull something up got the FM radio

here pull something up got the FM radio
everything<00:02:34.400> flashlights<00:02:35.120> same<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:36.940> guess<00:02:37.940> a

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
everything flashlights same I guess a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.940 
everything flashlights same I guess a
big<00:02:38.360> thing<00:02:38.690> are<00:02:38.930> some<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.260> new<00:02:39.410> installed

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
apps so IQs blocked callers you can just

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.290 
apps so IQs blocked callers you can just
add<00:02:45.590> callers<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.550> if<00:02:46.610> they<00:02:46.700> try<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.090> call

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
add callers here and if they try to call

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.820 
add callers here and if they try to call
it<00:02:47.570> go<00:02:47.660> straight<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.020> voice<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.350> as<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.710> your

really cool new thing here we've got tap
exit<00:03:31.130> one<00:03:31.850> really<00:03:32.060> cool<00:03:32.180> new<00:03:32.330> thing<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
exit one really cool new thing is the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.010 
exit one really cool new thing is the
hibernation<00:03:34.550> mode<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.630> seen<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:35.960> the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
hibernation mode this is seen on the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.360 
hibernation mode this is seen on the
desire<00:03:36.740> hd

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
desire hd

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.800 
desire hd
if<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.600> turn<00:03:39.050> off<00:03:39.310> pulp<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.490> power<00:03:40.760> menu<00:03:40.940> this

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
if you turn off pulp the power menu this

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.040 
if you turn off pulp the power menu this
new<00:03:42.140> mode<00:03:42.620> here<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:42.890> says<00:03:43.040> hibernate<00:03:43.990> so<00:03:44.990> if

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
new mode here it says hibernate so if

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.600 
new mode here it says hibernate so if
you<00:03:45.140> tap<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:47.090> goes<00:03:47.270> into<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.100> believe

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
you tap that it goes into and I believe

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.270 
you tap that it goes into and I believe
it<00:03:49.730> cuts<00:03:49.970> all<00:03:50.240> power<00:03:50.600> either<00:03:51.590> it's<00:03:52.010> just<00:03:52.040> very

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
it cuts all power either it's just very

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.670 
it cuts all power either it's just very
very<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:52.670> low-power<00:03:53.330> state<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.380> screen<00:03:54.620> is

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
very very low-power state so screen is

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.660 
very very low-power state so screen is
completely<00:03:54.860> turned<00:03:55.160> off<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.460> all<00:03:55.550> black<00:03:57.670> if

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
completely turned off it's all black if

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.240 
completely turned off it's all black if
I<00:03:58.880> turn<00:03:59.330> it<00:03:59.390> back<00:03:59.510> on<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.590> vibrates<00:04:00.980> tell<00:04:01.190> me

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
I turn it back on the vibrates tell me

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.470 
I turn it back on the vibrates tell me
it's<00:04:01.370> coming<00:04:01.580> on<00:04:01.780> light<00:04:02.780> shows<00:04:03.020> up<00:04:04.090> BAM<00:04:05.090> it's

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
it's coming on light shows up BAM it's

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.570 
it's coming on light shows up BAM it's
on<00:04:06.340> that's<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.670> like<00:04:07.820> ten-second<00:04:09.340> boot<00:04:10.340> time

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
on that's that like ten-second boot time

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.350 
on that's that like ten-second boot time
I<00:04:10.610> guess<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:13.370> desire<00:04:13.640> hd<00:04:14.000> was<00:04:14.120> praised

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
I guess that the desire hd was praised

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.440 
I guess that the desire hd was praised
for<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.740> is<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.310> software<00:04:16.760> thing<00:04:17.030> if<00:04:17.239> they

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
for so it is the software thing if they

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.970 
for so it is the software thing if they
I<00:04:18.370> guess<00:04:19.370> it's<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:20.590> hibernation<00:04:21.590> mode<00:04:21.739> not

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
I guess it's a hibernation mode not

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.830 
I guess it's a hibernation mode not
necessarily<00:04:22.460> powered<00:04:22.760> all<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:22.940> way<00:04:23.060> off<00:04:23.180> but

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
necessarily powered all the way off but

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.800 
necessarily powered all the way off but
it's<00:04:24.320> pretty<00:04:24.440> cool

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's pretty cool

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.830 
it's pretty cool
does<00:04:25.960> right<00:04:26.800> now<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:28.090> some<00:04:28.270> issues<00:04:28.570> coming

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
does right now have some issues coming

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.260 
does right now have some issues coming
back<00:04:28.990> awake<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.440> think<00:04:29.940> sometimes<00:04:30.940> it'll<00:04:31.120> come

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
back awake I think sometimes it'll come

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.680 
back awake I think sometimes it'll come
right<00:04:31.300> back<00:04:31.510> up<00:04:31.570> there<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.110> go<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:33.660> love<00:04:34.660> that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
right back up there we go so love that

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.640 
right back up there we go so love that

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
flip the clock the music application

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.620

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
oh the new drawer here they have your

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.960 
oh the new drawer here they have your
normal<00:05:07.300> notifications<00:05:07.810> here<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:08.169> this<00:05:08.350> is

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
normal notifications here like this is

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.540 
normal notifications here like this is
some<00:05:09.970> you<00:05:10.300> know<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.389> just<00:05:10.690> installed<00:05:11.020> some<00:05:11.229> apps

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
some you know I just installed some apps

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.820 
some you know I just installed some apps
but<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.850> shows<00:05:13.450> your<00:05:13.630> recently<00:05:14.110> used

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
but this shows your recently used

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.530 
but this shows your recently used
applications<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.850> I<00:05:15.940> think<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.180> shows<00:05:16.330> up<00:05:16.450> to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
applications and I think it shows up to

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.150 
applications and I think it shows up to
eight<00:05:16.690> or<00:05:16.960> maybe<00:05:17.530> twelve<00:05:19.919> that's<00:05:20.919> cool

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
eight or maybe twelve that's cool

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.080 
eight or maybe twelve that's cool
because<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.580> same<00:05:21.729> thing<00:05:22.000> that's

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
because it's the same thing that's

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.719 
because it's the same thing that's
holding<00:05:22.419> down<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.810> home<00:05:22.840> button<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:24.400> it's

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
holding down the home button but it's

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.310 
holding down the home button but it's
just<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:24.970> new<00:05:25.150> place<00:05:25.389> I<00:05:25.720> think<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.200> little

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
just a new place I think it's a little

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.270
