00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.319 
I was gonna do it myself I think if

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.779 
I was gonna do it myself I think if
you're<00:00:29.439> not<00:00:29.470> plus-size<00:00:30.130> you<00:00:30.369> don't<00:00:30.579> really

exact same outfit from Lane Bryant that

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.240 
exact same outfit from Lane Bryant that
she<00:00:40.539> got<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:41.109> know<00:00:41.260> because<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:41.980> was<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
she got you know because that was the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.759 
she got you know because that was the
only<00:00:42.280> piece<00:00:42.820> targeted<00:00:43.390> at<00:00:43.480> women<00:00:43.570> 25<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.679> know

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
only piece targeted at women 25 you know

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.720 
only piece targeted at women 25 you know
25<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.190> 34<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:47.500> think<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.070> large<00:00:48.370> part

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
25 to 34 and I think that a large part

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.169 
25 to 34 and I think that a large part
of<00:00:48.969> people's<00:00:49.600> style<00:00:49.989> is<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.890> reflection<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.879> how

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
of people's style is a reflection of how

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.689 
of people's style is a reflection of how
you<00:00:52.239> want<00:00:52.690> society<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.530> treat<00:00:53.769> you<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.460> if<00:00:54.550> you

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
you want society to treat you so if you

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.389 
you want society to treat you so if you
walk<00:00:54.910> around<00:00:55.120> dumpy<00:00:55.839> and<00:00:55.989> sloppy<00:00:56.379> all<00:00:57.070> of<00:00:57.309> a

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
walk around dumpy and sloppy all of a

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.340 
walk around dumpy and sloppy all of a
sudden<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.149> how<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.390> get<00:00:58.629> treated<00:00:58.960> you

sudden that is how you get treated you

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.110 
sudden that is how you get treated you
walk<00:00:59.589> straighter<00:01:00.219> you<00:01:00.489> walk<00:01:00.640> with<00:01:00.820> your<00:01:00.969> head

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120
