00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
outside of the box so this is the design

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.350 
outside of the box so this is the design
paper<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.059> took<00:00:54.180> the

paper and what I did was I just took the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.340 
paper and what I did was I just took the
lid<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.730> traced<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
lid of the can and then traced around it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
lid of the can and then traced around it
and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.039> edged<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.760> edging<00:01:00.149> tool

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and then i edged it with my edging tool

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.830 
and then i edged it with my edging tool
and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.020> distressed<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.329> here<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and then I distressed it and here this

had<00:01:08.310> given<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.500> cut<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> out

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
had given me and then I just cut it out

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
had given me and then I just cut it out
I<00:01:12.110> add<00:01:13.110> dimensional<00:01:13.650> stickers<00:01:13.799> underneath

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I add dimensional stickers underneath

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
I add dimensional stickers underneath
and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.630> cut<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> image<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and then I cut out the image of this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.420 
and then I cut out the image of this
butterfly<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.850> i<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> website<00:01:18.479> pages

and i got this from frosted pink calm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.969 
and i got this from frosted pink calm
and<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.820> what<00:01:26.939> i<00:01:26.970> did<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.210> i<00:01:27.710> cut<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and so what i did was i cut out the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
and so what i did was i cut out the
design<00:01:29.280> paper<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.630> 12<00:01:30.840> x<00:01:30.960> 12<00:01:31.170> design

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
design paper and the 12 x 12 design

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.850 
design paper and the 12 x 12 design
paper<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:33.060> around<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> i

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
paper doesn't go all the way around so i

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
paper doesn't go all the way around so i
stopped<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.360> right<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
stopped it as you can see right here and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
stopped it as you can see right here and
then<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.090> double<00:01:39.479> sided<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
then I just because it's double sided I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.710 
then I just because it's double sided I
flipped<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.680> image<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.880> cut<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
flipped the other image to cut the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230 
flipped the other image to cut the
smaller<00:01:42.990> piece<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> just

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
smaller piece right here and then I just

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.719 
smaller piece right here and then I just
kept<00:01:45.540> one<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> these<00:01:46.020> images<00:01:46.619> from<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> design

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
kept one of these images from the design

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.780 
kept one of these images from the design
paper<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> place<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.780> front<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.790> in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
paper and place it in the front and in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.780 
paper and place it in the front and in
the<00:01:50.880> center<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:52.229> cut<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:52.890> an<00:01:53.189> image<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the center here I cut out an image and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.840 
the center here I cut out an image and
then<00:01:53.909> add<00:01:54.060> dimensional<00:01:54.659> stickers<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.850> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
then add dimensional stickers on it and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590 
then add dimensional stickers on it and
then<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:57.840> i<00:01:57.869> added<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.409> butterfly<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
then here i added a butterfly so that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.420 
then here i added a butterfly so that's
how<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.810> decorated<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
how I decorated the can and then I just

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.600 
how I decorated the can and then I just
edged<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.899> walnut<00:02:04.829> stain<00:02:05.130> distress

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
edged it with the walnut stain distress

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.200 
edged it with the walnut stain distress
ink<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:08.009> let's<00:02:08.190> turn<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> can

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
ink and so let's turn the can

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.320 
ink and so let's turn the can
and<00:02:10.510> as<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.440> can<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.650> here<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.400> lid<00:02:12.940> will<00:02:13.150> not

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and as you can see here the lid will not

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.110 
and as you can see here the lid will not
go<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.780> down<00:02:13.900> if<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:15.550> tried<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
go all the way down if I tried it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.940 
go all the way down if I tried it
already<00:02:16.270> with<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> design<00:02:17.110> paper<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.650> when

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
already with the design paper and when

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.850 
already with the design paper and when
it<00:02:18.070> closed<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.610> way<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:20.110> cut<00:02:20.680> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
it closed all the way so I just cut it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.670 
it closed all the way so I just cut it
enough<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.400> where<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.480> lids<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.320> right

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
enough to where the lids it's right

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.550 
enough to where the lids it's right
where<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.310> meets<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.700> design<00:02:25.090> paper<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.750> it's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
where it meets the design paper and it's

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.260 
where it meets the design paper and it's
fine<00:02:26.770> with<00:02:26.950> me<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:27.640> mind<00:02:27.760> because<00:02:28.030> it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
fine with me I don't mind because it

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.850 
fine with me I don't mind because it
will<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.570> closed<00:02:28.810> anyways<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.440> won't<00:02:29.620> really

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
will be closed anyways I won't really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.520 
will be closed anyways I won't really

where I had enough space where I could
put<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.080> picture<00:04:02.350> but<00:04:02.710> then<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:02.920> still<00:04:03.130> yet<00:04:03.340> get

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
put a picture but then you still yet get

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.850 
put a picture but then you still yet get
the<00:04:03.610> image<00:04:03.940> in<00:04:04.270> there<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:04.840> that's<00:04:05.440> what<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.620> did

another<00:04:10.780> one<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.460> frame<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.030> cut

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
another one this is a frame that I cut

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.530 
another one this is a frame that I cut
out<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.920> there's<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.160> rose<00:04:15.670> with<00:04:16.180> the

out and then there's a rose with the
lead<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.930> cut<00:04:17.200> out<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:18.850> I

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
lead that I cut out like like I

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.550 
lead that I cut out like like I
mentioned<00:04:19.120> all<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.540> images<00:04:19.750> are<00:04:19.989> cut<00:04:20.169> out<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
then I place dimensional stickers too

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.050 
then I place dimensional stickers too
I'm<00:04:23.620> give<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.980> a<00:04:24.040> lift<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.760> here's<00:04:24.910> the

too much to that one this one this is
actually<00:05:41.669> from<00:05:42.669> this<00:05:42.880> design<00:05:43.240> paper<00:05:43.510> right

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
actually from this design paper right

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.680 
actually from this design paper right
here<00:05:43.780> actually<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:44.500> just<00:05:45.100> cut<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.580> out<00:05:45.669> and<00:05:45.970> made

a border strip then the butterfly i

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.760 
a border strip then the butterfly i
edged<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.560> then<00:05:51.160> just<00:05:51.190> rest<00:05:51.550> it<00:05:52.770> that's
