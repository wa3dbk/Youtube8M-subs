00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
without further ado we will go and take

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.600 
without further ado we will go and take
a<00:01:49.810> look<00:01:49.930> at<00:01:50.230> all<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.620> spells<00:01:50.890> here's<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.400> look

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
a look at all the spells here's a look

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.770 
a look at all the spells here's a look
at<00:01:51.760> his<00:01:51.850> spells<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.240> figured<00:01:52.480> this<00:01:52.570> would<00:01:52.660> be<00:01:52.720> a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
at his spells I figured this would be a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.050 
at his spells I figured this would be a
good<00:01:52.960> area<00:01:53.230> to<00:01:53.290> do<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.740> here's<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.070> Q<00:01:54.280> which

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
good area to do it so here's the Q which

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.580 
good area to do it so here's the Q which
I'm<00:01:55.270> pretty<00:01:55.420> sure<00:01:55.540> at<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.110> time<00:01:56.410> is

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
I'm pretty sure at this time is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.010 
I'm pretty sure at this time is
unchanged<00:01:57.250> but<00:01:58.060> I<00:01:58.120> was<00:01:58.330> reading<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
unchanged but I was reading that the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.650 
unchanged but I was reading that the
price<00:01:59.290> 1350<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.460> relative<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.120> change<00:02:01.390> and

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
price 1350 is relative the change and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.750 
price 1350 is relative the change and
the<00:02:01.780> abilities<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:02.620> in<00:02:02.740> early<00:02:03.340> alpha

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
the abilities as it's in early alpha

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.420
