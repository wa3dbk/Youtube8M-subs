00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.240 

are<00:00:24.839> waiting<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.169> this<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.589> harden<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:25.980> that's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
are waiting for this to harden up that's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.679 
are waiting for this to harden up that's
what<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.579> actually<00:00:26.699> sand<00:00:27.239> it<00:00:27.390> we're<00:00:27.599> gonna

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
what I can actually sand it we're gonna

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
what I can actually sand it we're gonna
revisit<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.470> spoon<00:00:28.769> theory<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.279> point<00:00:32.519> of<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
revisit the spoon theory the point of it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.450 
revisit the spoon theory the point of it
is<00:00:32.879> below<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> pump<00:00:34.129> there's<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.250> pump

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is below the pump there's the pump

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.299 
is below the pump there's the pump
that's<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.000> larger<00:00:36.239> gotta<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that's where the larger gotta go this is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.450 
that's where the larger gotta go this is
a<00:00:38.339> spoon<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:39.739> radius<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.949> the<00:00:41.070> bottom<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
a spoon see radius like the bottom of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360 
a spoon see radius like the bottom of
the<00:00:41.519> boat<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.960> end<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> bent<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.159> that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the boat this end is bent and that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
the boat this end is bent and that
dependence<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:45.089> to<00:00:45.210> form<00:00:45.479> it<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.720> here<00:00:46.190> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
dependence more to form it in here it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.460 
dependence more to form it in here it
goes<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.519> there<00:00:47.699> like<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
goes on there like that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.110 
goes on there like that
and<00:00:49.470> ends<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.769> having<00:00:49.949> a<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.250> sharp<00:00:50.850> sights

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and ends up having a big sharp sights

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
and ends up having a big sharp sights
and<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.870> stuff<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.290> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and all that kind of stuff this is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.060 
and all that kind of stuff this is
radius<00:00:52.800> down<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.629> what<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> does<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.830> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
radius down in there what it does is it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.530 
radius down in there what it does is it
loads<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> pump<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.059> water<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.449> actually

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
loads the pump the water will actually

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.140 
loads the pump the water will actually
follow<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.259> around<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:59.250> into<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.580> pump

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
follow this around and into the pump

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.850 
follow this around and into the pump
this<00:01:00.780> piece<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.199> sticking<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.619> from<00:01:01.769> the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
this piece is sticking up from the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.350 
this piece is sticking up from the
bottom<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.189> the<00:01:02.309> boat<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.790> it's<00:01:02.939> gonna<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.210> down

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
bottom of the boat so it's gonna be down

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.009 
bottom of the boat so it's gonna be down
in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.689> water

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
in the water

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
in the water
all<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> time<00:01:04.939> only<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> quarter<00:01:06.270> inch<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
all the time only a quarter inch but

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.899 
all the time only a quarter inch but
that<00:01:06.810> could<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.380> difference

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
that could make all the difference

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.069 
that could make all the difference
usually<00:01:08.909> they're<00:01:09.090> using<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.509> boats<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> ton

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
usually they're using on boats a ton

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.100 
usually they're using on boats a ton
over<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.350> hundred<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.240> was<00:01:12.240> playing<00:01:12.780> around<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
over a hundred I was playing around the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
over a hundred I was playing around the
idea<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> trying<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.829> this<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.340> don't

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
idea of trying it on this one I don't

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
idea of trying it on this one I don't
know<00:01:14.579> I<00:01:15.049> came<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> demonstration<00:01:16.829> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
know I came up with a demonstration to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.780 
know I came up with a demonstration to
show<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:18.090> spoon<00:01:18.390> works<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.079> if<00:01:19.200> people

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
show you how spoon works so if people

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.859 
show you how spoon works so if people
shut<00:01:20.790> her<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.390> over<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.659> kitchen

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
shut her down a lot over the kitchen

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.950 
shut her down a lot over the kitchen
there<00:01:22.200> mister<00:01:22.500> cameraman<00:01:26.659> okay<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.870> were

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there mister cameraman okay we were

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.060 
there mister cameraman okay we were
talking<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.350> spoons

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
talking about spoons

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
talking about spoons
that's<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.760> spoon<00:01:30.000> another<00:01:30.240> plan<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that's the spoon another plan was the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
that's the spoon another plan was the
idea<00:01:32.180> there's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> real<00:01:33.420> spoon<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:34.220> just<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
idea there's a real spoon I just want to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
idea there's a real spoon I just want to
show<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.760> little<00:01:35.940> demonstration<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
show you a little demonstration of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.100 
show you a little demonstration of
what's<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.890> why<00:01:38.280> are<00:01:38.430> we<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.640> spoon

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.350 

imagine<00:01:42.890> that's<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> water<00:01:43.430> rushing<00:01:44.180> by<00:01:44.300> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
imagine that's the water rushing by the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.260 
imagine that's the water rushing by the
bottom<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.900> boat<00:01:45.430> intakes<00:01:46.430> about<00:01:46.730> here<00:01:47.090> I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
bottom of the boat intakes about here I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.970 
bottom of the boat intakes about here I
want<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.630> load<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.990> intake<00:01:48.350> normal<00:01:48.860> are

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
want to load the intake normal are

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.950 
want to load the intake normal are
trying<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.370> go<00:01:49.490> straight<00:01:49.550> past

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.510 

there's<00:01:56.530> food<00:01:56.910> that's<00:01:57.910> why<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.180> call<00:01:58.360> this
