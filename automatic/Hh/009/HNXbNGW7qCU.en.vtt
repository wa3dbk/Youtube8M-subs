Oklahoma<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.689> soils<00:02:06.049> get<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.200> little<00:02:06.530> more

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680

around that problem is to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.740 
around that problem is to
add<00:02:14.420> some<00:02:14.750> magnesium<00:02:15.440> sulfate<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.310> epson<00:02:17.210> salt

tree thinking it would get it to bloom a
little<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.820> more<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.180> don't<00:02:35.420> need<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.660> do

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
little bit more but you don't need to do

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.420 
little bit more but you don't need to do
that<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.080> can<00:02:36.290> actually<00:02:36.470> build<00:02:36.830> up<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.220> high

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
that you can actually build up to high

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.360 
that you can actually build up to high
levels<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> magnesium<00:02:38.990> in<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.530> way<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:39.800> again

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
levels of magnesium in that way so again

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.000 
levels of magnesium in that way so again
just<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.640> heavy<00:02:40.850> dose<00:02:41.180> at<00:02:41.630> planting<00:02:42.170> time<00:02:42.230> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
just a heavy dose at planting time that

just a heavy dose at planting time that
is<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> central<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.120> western<00:02:44.150> part<00:02:44.600> of

is in the central and western part of
the<00:02:44.720> state<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.200> then<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.770> how<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.040> plant

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the state and then see how the plant

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.970 
the state and then see how the plant
reacts<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.020> years<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.440> follow

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
reacts in the years to follow

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.790 
reacts in the years to follow
but<00:02:49.810> magnesium<00:02:50.810> sulfate<00:02:51.260> will<00:02:51.440> help<00:02:51.620> them

but magnesium sulfate will help them

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.449 
but magnesium sulfate will help them
green<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.080> will<00:02:54.080> provide<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
green up and will provide just a

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.400 
green up and will provide just a
beautiful<00:02:56.030> dark<00:02:56.300> green<00:02:56.600> color<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.230> have

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
beautiful dark green color like we have

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.480 
beautiful dark green color like we have
on<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.709> tree<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.010> that's<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.430> the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
on this tree and that's one of the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.280 
on this tree and that's one of the
things<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.030> about<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.870> southern

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
things I like about the southern

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.620 
things I like about the southern
magnolia<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.370> get<00:03:01.490> just<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.090> curtain

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
magnolia you get just this this curtain

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.870 
magnolia you get just this this curtain
of<00:03:02.810> green<00:03:03.230> foliage<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.459> have<00:03:04.670> that

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
of green foliage and you have that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.970 
of green foliage and you have that
curtain<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.450> green<00:03:05.720> foliage<00:03:05.990> if<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.650> leave

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
curtain of green foliage if you leave

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.180 
curtain of green foliage if you leave
the<00:03:07.550> lower<00:03:07.820> limbs<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.900> southern<00:03:09.620> magnolia

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the lower limbs on the southern magnolia

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
the lower limbs on the southern magnolia
tree<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.520> highly<00:03:11.180> recommend<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.260> leave

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
tree I highly recommend that you leave

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.620 
tree I highly recommend that you leave
those<00:03:13.130> limbs<00:03:13.459> let<00:03:13.790> them<00:03:13.940> grow<00:03:14.150> all<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.450> way<00:03:14.480> to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
those limbs let them grow all the way to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.440 
those limbs let them grow all the way to
the<00:03:14.959> ground<00:03:15.260> because<00:03:16.220> if<00:03:16.459> they<00:03:16.880> are<00:03:16.910> cut<00:03:17.270> if

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the ground because if they are cut if

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.290 
the ground because if they are cut if
the<00:03:17.540> tree<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.840> limbed<00:03:18.290> up<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:19.250> kind<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:19.970> takes<00:03:20.150> a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the tree is limbed up it kind of takes a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.509 
the tree is limbed up it kind of takes a
little<00:03:20.450> bit<00:03:20.630> away<00:03:20.690> from<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.260> tree<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.130> also

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
little bit away from the tree and also

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.680 
little bit away from the tree and also
it's<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:22.850> hard<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.180> get<00:03:23.269> anything<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.600> grow

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
it's so hard to get anything to grow

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.930 
it's so hard to get anything to grow
underneath<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.950> southern<00:03:25.250> magnolia<00:03:25.730> because

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
underneath the southern magnolia because

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.479 
underneath the southern magnolia because
they<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.510> such<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.989> dense<00:03:27.350> shade<00:03:27.830> now

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
they do have such a dense shade now

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.160 
they do have such a dense shade now
leaving<00:03:28.880> those<00:03:29.150> limbs<00:03:29.480> all<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> way<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:29.989> the
