00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello everybody, we're here for one more 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.809
 Our math course class 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.369
 the subject on the day of the speaking that is 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 much of the baby 's entrance exam in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.060
 public competitions and also our life 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.600
 practice 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:34.280
 Let's do an exercise here today. 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:38.750
 quite interesting following exercise 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.750
 I have here the 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 ae 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.530
 abin 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.420
 a father 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.039
 of wire 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 ae 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969
 I drink 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830
 a leap 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.420
 the billing that will get the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.820
 people can stop this an expression 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 simpler than we can 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.600
 check common factors for example 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 here analyzing notes that Haiti is 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 haiti yeah yeah that power 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.550
 production and our position in the second 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.220
 to realize that you have always 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:55.729
 without receiving it here is quite a fact 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.729
 makes it curious you are 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 My God is here. 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:15.120
 and also everything 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.400
 as I am always here received here has 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.780
 of God a segment that will achieve 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.020
 find some enjoyment 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.250
 Let's do the following, let's put it there. 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.800
 in evidence 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.200
 there is a tendency for the afternoon to be here 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:41.940
 we returned to his point then it would be 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:46.000
 Hot explains know more for sure 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.980
 because having had will be to be respect 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.190
 the water that falls like this but the fight 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.450
 just what we have here is not the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.350
 second goal that we would have to be 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:08.220
 more to see the Benedictine 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.220
 It's fair without more than malu 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.700
 Here we see the vision that we have of everything 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.860
 that this should be down from 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.810
 give up too fernandez and then go 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.720
 drink that exactly what we have 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.010
 here then our 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 in this resolution, he now observes that 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.560
 we have a common factor in the two 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.640
 expressions that is the cb questions and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.320
 is on the streets 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.120
 she is in the streets putting us in the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:49.610
 personal change can could that be 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:53.300
 but the striking coincidences began 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:56.260
 for being more time that multiplies the act 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.260
 that places partner 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:06.940
 the act of what I let alone the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:12.030
 The sun is then formed and with 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.030
 interesting is that you will run out of 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:24.330
 winning with a calf notes that 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:31.170
 expression help ladies and more 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:34.170
 multiply but that is our answer 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.170
 attestation 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.780
 we multiply their appeal to God and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.750
 by turkey 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.699
 then I b through the air and dtmb championship 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.310
 them we will find there is the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.139
 answer that is the beginning of the question 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.240
 and you could also put the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.220
 because the air is normally 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.669
 the first letter of the alphabet in exchange 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:01.770
 it 's not over breaking sequence 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:07.979
 back open more than you do not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.710
 More than perfect planet 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.539
 so it's an interesting question that gives 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.560
 support of our memory to 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.120
 accounting matters 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.340
 Thank you for your attention, evaluate our 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.940
 channel and continue to watch mother 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.940
