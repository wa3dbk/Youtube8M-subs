00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
college and and so that's that was the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
college and and so that's that was the
question<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> motivated<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.899> drove<00:01:46.079> me

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
question that motivated me and drove me

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
question that motivated me and drove me
and<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> flying<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> California

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and so I was flying down to California

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
and so I was flying down to California
on<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.659> bye<00:01:48.840> week<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.320> thinking<00:01:49.530> about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
on my bye week and I was thinking about

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
on my bye week and I was thinking about
what<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.040> why<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> foundation<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
what can I do why not you foundation for

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.210 
what can I do why not you foundation for
its<00:01:52.020> first<00:01:52.170> initiative<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> thought<00:01:52.979> about

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
its first initiative and I thought about

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
its first initiative and I thought about
all<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> things<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
all the things going on not just in the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.569 
all the things going on not just in the
National<00:01:55.500> Football<00:01:55.619> League<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.100> across<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
National Football League but across the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
National Football League but across the
across<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> United<00:01:58.170> States<00:01:58.409> across<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
across the United States across the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.149 
across the United States across the
across<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> world<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.689> domestic<00:02:01.560> bounces<00:02:01.920> as

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
across the world and domestic bounces as

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.940 
across the world and domestic bounces as
a<00:02:02.219> prevalent<00:02:02.700> issue<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.990> figured<00:02:04.740> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a prevalent issue and so I figured I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.190 
a prevalent issue and so I figured I
figured<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> had<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> think

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.340 
it's not about necessary what people did
but<00:03:36.340> what<00:03:36.549> how<00:03:36.760> can<00:03:36.820> we<00:03:37.090> move<00:03:37.510> forward<00:03:37.570> how<00:03:38.170> can

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
but what how can we move forward how can

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.050 
but what how can we move forward how can
we<00:03:38.410> focus<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.859> now<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.040> moving<00:03:39.400> forward

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
we focus on the now and moving forward

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.509 
we focus on the now and moving forward
and<00:03:40.359> that's<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.720> focus<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.340> that's<00:03:42.340> why<00:03:42.489> I

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
and that's the focus and that's why I

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.090 
and that's the focus and that's why I
say<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.940> video<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.720> my<00:03:43.840> promise<00:03:44.230> to

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
say in the video this is my promise to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.610 
say in the video this is my promise to
do<00:03:45.220> my<00:03:45.250> part<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.090> think<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:47.109> a<00:03:47.260> focus

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
do my part and I think it's it's a focus

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.319 
do my part and I think it's it's a focus
on<00:03:47.739> on<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> inner<00:03:48.310> self<00:03:48.579> first<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.180> then

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
on on the inner self first and then

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.210 
on on the inner self first and then
passing<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.109> forth<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.590> next<00:03:50.799> person<00:03:51.100> I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
passing it forth to the next person I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.289 
passing it forth to the next person I
think<00:03:51.400> people<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.820> been<00:03:51.880> watching

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
think people that have been watching

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.060 
think people that have been watching
this<00:03:52.359> from<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.600> outside<00:03:52.959> or<00:03:53.200> are<00:03:53.650> sort<00:03:54.010> of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
this from the outside or are sort of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.430 
this from the outside or are sort of
wondering<00:03:54.579> whether<00:03:54.959> there's<00:03:55.959> an<00:03:56.109> awareness

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
wondering whether there's an awareness

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.710 
wondering whether there's an awareness
of<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.980> level<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.430> seriousness<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:58.299> what<00:03:58.510> has

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
of the level of seriousness of what has

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.039 
of the level of seriousness of what has
played<00:03:59.140> out<00:03:59.319> on<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.799> national<00:04:00.220> scene<00:04:01.049> like

played out on the national scene like

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.430 
played out on the national scene like
