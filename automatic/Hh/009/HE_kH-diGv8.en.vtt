00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.310
 all very well here I am commenting today 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.200
 a new royalty is crowned 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.530
 which I know that you like me 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.170
 also then because a barbarian king 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.119
 level 1 is capable of destroying a 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.190
 rival bonus level 5 because I bring the 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.539
 explanation today here 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.270
 check the number of strokes you give 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.210
 my barbarian king which has 129 damage 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.700
 and a thousand 876 of life and a barbarian king of 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.680
 level 1 has 120 damage and 1700 life 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.680
 OK, count them with me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:56.570
 12 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:59.470
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.940
 as you can see my rival has now done 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.239
 attacked then nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.119
 12 times then if I do a calculation of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:14.440
 12 x for 120 once I get a thousand 548 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.690
 points of life that has taken away 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.410
 remember that the life of your barbarian king 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.020
 It was 1,700 points and my male king has 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:30.350
 done thousand 548 then they are 152 points 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.830
 that his profile has given me with this 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.690
 I want to say that when your profile did 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.550
 the update in which the rave alvaro 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.930
 happened to be a troop with equal radio 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.240
 that the sand is diego with radio 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.750
 defensive turned it into a very take 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.050
 very strong difficult to remove and with much 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.340
 life and a lot of damage because I say this 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.430
 right now I just gave you the example 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 that my opponent at level 5 without throwing 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.369
 rage must be said 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 has been able to with his barbarian but look 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.390
 the life you have is that they are not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.990
 nothing of life right now a cannon what 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.400
 I would make powder 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.550
 so 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.250
 his profile here I think the annoyance 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.140
 a little bit is good that you revalue defend 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.210
 well but it's also bad that you revalued 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 can not almost against a rival who is 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.350
 you get so much level with so much difference 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
 level as your 1 to 5 with skill 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.040
 even good because until now it has arrived 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.990
 today's video I hope you have 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.940
 liked if not so do not forget to give the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.940
 like and subscribe and until next time 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.560
