about two thousand eight when I first

heard their album a light of night which
in<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.670> opinion<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> pretty<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.600> spacey

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310

thing<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.640> sonic<00:01:12.330> variety<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.380> bigger

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

this<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> fantastic<00:01:18.000> album<00:01:18.570> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this was just a fantastic album for

as<00:01:32.009> disappointing<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> EP<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> they

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
as disappointing as the EP that they

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
as disappointing as the EP that they
followed<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.500> love<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.009> oblivion<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.670> with

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I'm not really warming up to this thing

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
I'm not really warming up to this thing
to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> point<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> love<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> head<00:01:40.049> over

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
to the point where I love it head over

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
to the point where I love it head over
heels<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.220> album<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.729> band<00:01:41.909> goes<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
heels on this album the band goes into a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.710 
heels on this album the band goes into a
decidedly<00:01:43.470> less<00:01:44.720> energetic<00:01:46.130> psychedelic<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
decidedly less energetic psychedelic and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.179 
decidedly less energetic psychedelic and
experimental<00:01:48.720> direction<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.829> but

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
experimental direction I would say but

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
experimental direction I would say but
to<00:01:50.460> what<00:01:50.700> end<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.229> sure<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
to what end I'm not really sure a lot of

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399 
to what end I'm not really sure a lot of
the<00:01:53.520> instrumentation<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the instrumentation on this thing is is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
the instrumentation on this thing is is
much<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.950> audible<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.060> smothered<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
much more audible not so smothered in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
much more audible not so smothered in
effects<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> only<00:01:58.979> thing<00:01:59.159> getting<00:01:59.579> rid

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
effects but the only thing getting rid

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.510 
effects but the only thing getting rid
of<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> effects<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:00.810> exposed<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
of the effects has exposed is is the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
of the effects has exposed is is the
band's<00:02:02.700> incredibly<00:02:03.299> simple<00:02:03.750> approach<00:02:04.200> to

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
instrumentation with this really eerie

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.690 
instrumentation with this really eerie
melody<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.989> kind<00:04:15.350> of<00:04:15.380> creeps<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:16.040> really

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
melody that kind of creeps in really

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.479 
melody that kind of creeps in really
delicately<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.290> kind<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.709> delicate

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
delicately and and this kind of delicate

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.340 
delicately and and this kind of delicate
approach<00:04:20.090> isn't<00:04:20.480> really<00:04:21.020> something<00:04:21.169> you

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
approach isn't really something you

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.590 
approach isn't really something you
usually<00:04:21.620> hear<00:04:22.100> on<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.250> crystal<00:04:22.640> stilts<00:04:22.910> album<00:04:23.450> I

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
usually hear on a crystal stilts album I

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.390 
usually hear on a crystal stilts album I
i<00:04:23.630> think<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.350> direction<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.950> crystal

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
i think the direction that crystal

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.590 
i think the direction that crystal
stilts<00:04:25.610> are<00:04:25.820> shooting<00:04:26.210> for

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
stilts are shooting for

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.900 
stilts are shooting for
sounds<00:04:27.320> really<00:04:27.560> great<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:27.980> paper<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.670> think

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
sounds really great on paper and I think

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.180 
sounds really great on paper and I think
it<00:04:29.000> sounds<00:04:29.360> really<00:04:29.390> great<00:04:30.190> instrumentally

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
it sounds really great instrumentally

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.820 
it sounds really great instrumentally
most<00:04:31.790> of<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.030> time<00:04:32.270> however<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.260> think<00:04:33.710> there

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
most of the time however I think there

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.590 
most of the time however I think there
are<00:04:33.860> moments<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.610> album<00:04:34.790> where<00:04:35.150> some<00:04:35.570> of

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
are moments on this album where some of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.390 
are moments on this album where some of
the<00:04:35.690> loose<00:04:35.990> playing<00:04:36.590> some<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.100> loose<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the loose playing some of the loose and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.820 
the loose playing some of the loose and
slow<00:04:38.000> playing<00:04:38.510> that<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> band<00:04:39.080> delivers<00:04:39.500> like

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
slow playing that the band delivers like

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.720 
slow playing that the band delivers like
on<00:04:40.010> Star<00:04:40.280> crawl<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.320> JB's<00:04:42.320> vocals<00:04:42.860> on<00:04:43.220> pretty

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
on Star crawl and JB's vocals on pretty

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.790 
on Star crawl and JB's vocals on pretty
much<00:04:43.820> every<00:04:44.150> track<00:04:44.420> don't<00:04:45.080> really<00:04:45.500> lend

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
much every track don't really lend

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.860 
much every track don't really lend
themselves<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.820> beauty<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.570> think

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
themselves to the beauty that I think

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.500 
themselves to the beauty that I think
they're<00:04:48.020> trying<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.440> grab<00:04:49.310> for<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.060> sometimes

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
they're trying to grab for and sometimes

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.670 
they're trying to grab for and sometimes
even<00:04:50.720> though<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.020> melodies<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.410> they<00:04:51.620> do

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
even though the melodies that they do

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.530 
even though the melodies that they do
employ<00:04:52.130> on<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:52.490> album<00:04:52.670> can<00:04:53.060> be<00:04:53.090> kind<00:04:53.420> of

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
employ on this album can be kind of

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.570 
employ on this album can be kind of
pretty<00:04:53.750> they're<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.620> enough<00:04:55.160> they're

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
pretty they're not enough they're

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.430 
pretty they're not enough they're
they're<00:04:55.880> they're<00:04:55.910> really<00:04:56.390> too<00:04:56.630> simple<00:04:57.230> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
they're they're really too simple and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.040 
they're they're really too simple and
too<00:04:57.470> short<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.730> kind<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.150> carry<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.840> weight<00:05:00.020> of

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
too short to kind of carry the weight of

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.960 
too short to kind of carry the weight of
an<00:05:00.320> entire<00:05:00.680> track<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.340> feels<00:05:01.580> really

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
an entire track that feels really

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.450 
an entire track that feels really
repetitive<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.870> kind<00:05:03.380> of<00:05:03.560> mundane<00:05:03.800> sort<00:05:04.400> of

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
repetitive and kind of mundane sort of

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.670 
repetitive and kind of mundane sort of
like<00:05:04.580> world<00:05:04.820> gone<00:05:05.060> wrong<00:05:05.420> overall<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.140> did<00:05:06.440> like

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
like world gone wrong overall I did like

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.650 
like world gone wrong overall I did like
this<00:05:06.860> LP<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.310> feel<00:05:07.640> like<00:05:07.760> crystal<00:05:08.180> stilts<00:05:08.420> have

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
this LP I feel like crystal stilts have

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.380 
this LP I feel like crystal stilts have
still<00:05:08.960> kept<00:05:09.620> their<00:05:09.830> aesthetic<00:05:10.430> while<00:05:10.940> trying

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
still kept their aesthetic while trying

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.780 
still kept their aesthetic while trying
to<00:05:11.540> change<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.680> sort<00:05:12.980> of<00:05:13.070> do<00:05:13.250> something<00:05:13.580> new

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
to change and sort of do something new

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.360 
to change and sort of do something new
for<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.480> band<00:05:14.720> at<00:05:15.200> least<00:05:15.470> half<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.100> songs

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
for the band at least half of the songs

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.220 
for the band at least half of the songs
on<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:16.940> thing<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.420> find<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.840> really

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
on this thing I find to be really

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.320 
on this thing I find to be really
enjoyable<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.430> have<00:05:19.550> faith<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:19.850> into<00:05:20.240> the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
enjoyable and I have faith that into the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.270 
enjoyable and I have faith that into the
future<00:05:20.540> maybe<00:05:20.960> they'll<00:05:21.170> find<00:05:21.440> a<00:05:21.530> way<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.740> take

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
future maybe they'll find a way to take

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.980 
future maybe they'll find a way to take
some<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> these<00:05:22.700> beautiful<00:05:23.300> melodies<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
some of these beautiful melodies and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.590 
some of these beautiful melodies and
more<00:05:24.380> delicate<00:05:24.980> sounds<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:25.730> incorporate

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
more delicate sounds and incorporate

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.990 
more delicate sounds and incorporate
them<00:05:26.630> with<00:05:27.020> their<00:05:27.320> strange<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.190> odd<00:05:28.340> effects

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
them with their strange and odd effects

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.930 
them with their strange and odd effects
or<00:05:29.150> go<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:29.930> roar<00:05:30.290> out<00:05:30.560> go<00:05:30.920> that<00:05:31.100> softer<00:05:31.730> route

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
or go that roar out go that softer route

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.120 
or go that roar out go that softer route
but<00:05:32.180> maybe<00:05:32.420> bring<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.960> little<00:05:33.200> bit<00:05:33.350> detail<00:05:33.800> into

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
but maybe bring a little bit detail into

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.070 
but maybe bring a little bit detail into
the<00:05:34.370> process<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.450> song<00:05:35.690> stay

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
the process so that the song stay
