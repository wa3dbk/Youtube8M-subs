00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.120 
in order to do that I'm going to remove
these<00:03:46.490> two<00:03:46.660> front<00:03:47.660> Center<00:03:47.990> bolts<00:03:48.380> from<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
these two front Center bolts from the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:04:15.010 
these two front Center bolts from the
bike<00:03:49.280> frame<00:04:13.150> once<00:04:14.150> both<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.600> bolts<00:04:14.900> are

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
bike frame once both of the bolts are

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.039 
bike frame once both of the bolts are
out<00:04:15.110> take<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.160> engine<00:04:16.459> guard<00:04:16.640> slider<00:04:17.090> and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
out take the engine guard slider and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.930 
out take the engine guard slider and
just<00:04:18.980> slide<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.549> metal<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:20.780> on<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.410> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
just slide the metal right on like that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.220 
just slide the metal right on like that
then<00:04:22.940> you'll<00:04:23.180> take<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.660> new<00:04:23.990> bolts<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:26.660> stuff

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
then you'll take the new bolts and stuff

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.050 
then you'll take the new bolts and stuff
the<00:04:27.380> new<00:04:27.500> bolts<00:04:27.770> in<00:04:27.980> instead<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.550> original

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
the new bolts in instead of the original

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.620 
the new bolts in instead of the original
they're<00:04:29.300> slightly<00:04:29.510> longer<00:04:34.120> once<00:04:35.120> it's<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.450> I'm

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
they're slightly longer once it's on I'm

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.350 
they're slightly longer once it's on I'm
gonna<00:04:35.810> look<00:04:35.900> like<00:04:35.960> this
