00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.839
 a lady landing the bus and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 tries to reach its destination by the way 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.519
 shorter after a few minutes 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.250
 exists and goes the safest way 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.590
 a route that could be four 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 minutes now will be 20 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 because the shortest route is not the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 This is the area code 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 pedestrians of this capital 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.960
 exchanged for insurmountable avenues 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 that make access to the city impossible 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.149
 foreseen in the national mobility plan 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.930
 urban closing cross that lived 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.570
 very 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 is the case of the ibirapuera obelisk that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.520
 is home to an important cultural center 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.260
 access to which is limited to those who 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 go by car we're in the middle of the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 ibirapuera park that was after 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.789
 inaugurated cut by an avenue that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 in a way totally segregated 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.969
 unacceptable public space 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 wonderful, we have more than 5 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 one thousand square meters 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.949
 it is a funeral monument and not for 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 This we must condemn to death is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.390
 match now I no doubt 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 makes it difficult for people to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 know if the part that is part of the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 São Paulo history not once had 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 curiosity from there seeing you will not 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 push you go in the sea ​​you go on 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.229
 magic sees if it closes a week without 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 It's clear that it's been closed for 12 years. 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 you do not have to even get the biggest 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 city ​​monument people forget 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.540
 we accept this policy aimed at 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.750
 the car that serves a third of the population 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 of the city and do not complain I'll try 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.520
 cross the avenue pedro álvares 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.390
 cabral toward the soldier's mausoleum 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.390
 constitutionalist a dangerous adventure 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.070
 the experience inside the mausoleum was 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.200
 interesting but until we get there 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.180
 went ahead and then we 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.100
 came back here to get through 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.900
 we still run the risk of being run over 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 because there was no pedestrian track 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.759
 through a simple flyby through the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.210
 city shows us the number of areas 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.340
 access for the same reasons 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.270
 are idle spaces affiliated with 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.640
 avenues 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.190
 example of the square bagatelle field in the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.070
 northern zone with more than 30 thousand meters 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.290
 square 30 percent of its area is 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.690
 intended for motor vehicles and not 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.150
 there is a single pedestrian strip and 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.190
 enable people to access your 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.320
 green area you can access it there will be 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.850
 a large roundabout for vehicles 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.040
 individual motor 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.970
 with this the replica of the 14 bis of saints 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.970
 dumont has no unperceived function
