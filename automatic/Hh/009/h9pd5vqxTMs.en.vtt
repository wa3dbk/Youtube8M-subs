00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.490
 Welcome to a new edition 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.649
 the sorges news we always catch 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 directly to and indeed has square enix 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.889
 now officially revealed to her 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 new game to the series of six sex 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.960
 mankind how far out of ps4 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 xbox live and the pc play mgm again 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.670
 jenson the whole two years after that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 especially from young revolucion what the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 predecessor is really very much to me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.860
 Fanny liked very good game 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 and alan is doing a new part here 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.750
 Johnson with the interpol founded 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 task force argued together 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 to chase terrorists 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.450
 yes the whole thing is going on in the future 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 the people who do not know it 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 there are some people 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 that is, for example, argues 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.680
 a new eye was inserted with 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.750
 where you through the fight by the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 people can look through the walls 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 mark or your arm has been changed 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.750
 that transform into a weapon 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 or you can make yourself invisible 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 and that's what people are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.570
 there should be twice as many as 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.490
 in the predecessor 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.460
 So this typical more of all 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.020
 better optics the gameplay more capable 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.700
 that is nothing new 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.530
 but I have to say as I said so the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.369
 predecessor was great, I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.590
 this title 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.930
 the first pictures and the first trailer 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.320
 looks awesome from vechta great 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.479
 his 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
 I 'm looking forward to it official 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 releasedatum is not announced yet 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.930
 there have not existed yet 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.650
 that will probably be on the e3 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
 happen 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 it is not nearly that far 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.220
 Two months left and I'm curious 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 So as I said the predecessor was great 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 should also go improved bossfights 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.259
 that was another small point 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 because in the original version of boys 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 Lucio was not so horny there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.590
 is again an improved version 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.760
 out who I have not gambled 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.160
 here 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.880
 not always boxing again 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.150
 pulled through 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.460
 let's see that well 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.340
 Then there are new instructions on 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.530
 a call of duty black ops 3s like that 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.300
 People like people know that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.740
 who are interested in it yes 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.800
 always in small teaser now in 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.440
 last time and this suggests 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880
 that maybe in vietnam play 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 Maybe that's black ops 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 therefore, wakeboard is 2 and you have 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.810
 not seen so in principle you can 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.480
 assume that it's easy 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.270
 Again a marketing campaign from 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.010
 activision talks about the game 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.960
 to bring without it works every news 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.890
 his reports about it 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.160
 the traders will play everywhere 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.700
 and yes folded down has activision 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.860
 folded 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.540
 whether it is in the end black ops part or 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.810
 if only two or maybe one 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.810
 mix of it remains to be seen 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 However, we know new call of duty 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 will be in november for all consoles 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.530
 This year at the e3 provided 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.690
 probably back on the microsoft 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.700
 stage and you have to know that when you are 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.050
 interested in whether it is now 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.019
 black ops 3 means or or world awards 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.510
 to wait for vineyard remains to be seen 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.630
 because most people just want the one anyway 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.550
 Multiplayer gamble and let's see what 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.680
 you finally reveal it 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.030
 but that is that you can do that 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.340
 Actually just as marketing 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.989
 dismiss campaign I think then came 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.580
 rumored to be allegedly alleged 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.150
 supposedly mirror's edge 2 and mass 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.690
 effect 4 later this financial year 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.760
 could appear 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.489
 the financial year always comes from the end 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.560
 march or from the beginning of april to the end of march 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.540
 next year 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.140
 that's it this fiscal year 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.330
 current is going to bite more 2016 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.569
 The rumor says that in this time 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.920
 only 6 2 and mass effect comes a lot and 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.709
 I said to both titles 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.630
 super horny, I'm extremely excited 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.560
 but do not believe that they appear 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.780
 for one , it's two's since the page 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.400
 since the last on the e3 this so what 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.660
 never shown what showed there 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.810
 completely quiet 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.820
 yes you have not heard anything why because 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.419
 the dice staff member was star wars 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.320
 Battlefront that is much more important for 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.970
 ea plus work on it and I believe 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.820
 not that short after the title of 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.139
 broadcom of marius ebbers 2 comes out 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.330
 I just do not believe it will be before 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.150
 never appear and 23 months later 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.710
 I do not think so either 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.750
 then mass effect 4 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.430
 so yes last year at e3 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.050
 Then you have the developers 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.479
 Shown how you care about the product 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.850
 speak a pinch here and there 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.770
 concert concept drawing one 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.500
 Information that did not even have it right 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.650
 in the teaser trailer then again the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.410
 right trailer still gameplay that will 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.150
 I think this year change 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.280
 In any case with trailers gameplay times 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.350
 but I also watch my fist 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.390
 but I do not believe that anyway 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.050
 Maybe next year may be 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.160
 until the end of next year 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.200
 they should show in any case 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.910
 that both play if they finished 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.410
 are and the time has come 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.630
 them out I'd both moved instantly 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.760
 because of both of them I'm a big big one 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:41.750
 so that then but one more 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.160
 last news and indeed to a film and 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.979
 this is called kickin cem stream 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.830
 should come the third part of the series 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:55.360
 and who has watched jobs as it is 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.360
 has also seen the credits 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.759
 like such theories so now is no 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.500
 great spoiler for the story just that 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.460
 but that would not be heard anymore 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.080
 he just wants to turn it off like that 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.370
 if you want to jump street in the end for the 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.800
 people who have seen it come here 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.520
 Use this guy as possible 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.960
 continue 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.539
 Of course, we had many exaggerated 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.310
 No idea in space as cowboys in 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.150
 the cooking school etc 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.639
 and that was a super great job when i did 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.889
 thought it was funny though 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:30.449
 Developers are either still in 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:33.570
 Game mode, the brodos have said 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.009
 this is not just a joke like try 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.229
 it somehow lingering the one 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.449
 Continuation but we will see 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.810
 how that happens we can not do anything yet 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.229
 to say that I want it interesting as well 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.349
 the do what could be the 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:50.039
 imagine 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:53.039
 because it's about that was what I think 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.650
 I'm so highschool on college 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.380
 It is, I believe regulated in America because 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.880
 Of course they are too old for what 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.490
 you could have given so whatever 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.800
 accommodate 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.630
 Maybe you could do a film school 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.110
 make a film school pure that it 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.270
 comes who knows so 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.530
 puzzled if that might be 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.630
 that the two on a film school 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.400
 go out and accordingly so 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.220
 projects where they work as 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.320
 clad cowboys so what are indeed remains 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.669
 I have to say I think they are 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.070
 both movies super horny 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.870
 channing tatum and jonah hill fit 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.460
 Perfectly together the types are great 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:36.419
 cool and I'm looking forward to grand prix 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.340
 starts you come movie that comes though 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:43.229
 but not yet with fixed date can 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.449
 that's good people that's it for this time 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.830
 shorter than usual but fits 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:48.659
 I hope you enjoyed it, yes 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.210
 like your opinion on the respective 

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:52.620
 Write things in the comments and 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.349
 otherwise you have to be at the next 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.669
 news thanks for seeing or hearing 

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.669
 be of bye
