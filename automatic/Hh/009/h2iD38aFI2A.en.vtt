00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.230
 very good as you see we have here 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.150
 the anise 23 ds xl which is the new 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.129
 revision of the console is in the box 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.510
 with which it will be sold to the platform in 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.519
 Germany for what it has here 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.870
 the symbol of music the European box 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.029
 the Spanish box but possibly 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.860
 possible change things that stand out from the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.630
 box as you see is much smaller and 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.270
 much more more stylized than that of the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.079
 first 3ds it was a little wider 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.579
 on the other hand highlighting 90% of the 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.259
 Mountain size growth 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.559
 the screen in this case this 3d series 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.719
 is normal and this is the 3ds xl and for another 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.820
 part the happy warning that the 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.850
 console does not include the charger inside 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.620
 but well let's see what what the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.600
 packaging of the console 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.610
 all this very very very compressed as 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 you can see we have here the manual of 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 instructions that I think is weigh 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.519
 more than the console they even have then 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.610
 in all possible languages for the 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.710
 European market and good the console and a 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.320
 little more for the box no longer contributes anything 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.850
 plus 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.350
 and this is the 3ds xl is one of the three 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 models that will go on sale 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 at the end of July 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.109
 As you can see the mounted screens 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:17.270
 higher than 90 more than the 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.569
 of the original model the lower screen 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.609
 It has also received a redesign at the 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.759
 in size and especially the console now 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.170
 it's more stylized has the frames 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.060
 rounded ones has even received some 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.270
 some modification in the buttons that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.039
 now we will discuss the back 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 this stays exactly the same 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.090
 cartridges theme the triggers the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 pencil that grows accompanying all the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.040
 size of the console 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 and the card reader that is in this 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.280
 case 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.550
 as I say the more rounded edges 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.140
 the selection has also been modified 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.990
 the home selection buttons he will 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 he wants to be and the power is going to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.430
 turn it on to see a little 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.710
 at the level of the size of the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.479
 screens as it has been in the review 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 to have for nintendo I think it's 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.069
 palpable a little like the 90 by 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.800
 an additional percent of suddenly not of 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.150
 resolution but yes size to for 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.930
 the screen and the growth of the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 touch screen 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.740
 let's open the super mario 3d land 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.020
 launch of the console to see how 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.980
 it looks another thing we're going to place none 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.410
 of the aspects that has changed is that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.720
 now on the one hand the 3d indicator 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.850
 The 3d meter does not include the lights 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.350
 led that it brought in the previous console and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.600
 in addition a species has been incorporated 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 as a stop so that it does not occur 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.650
 no kind of unfortunate movement 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.650
 and activate the 3d now if we want to remove 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.810
 the 13 will sound a click 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.459
 and in this case if once a zonal clicks 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 impossible for the button to scroll through 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.710
 turning the console moving it 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 another important aspect of the console 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.400
 this review is that the sd card that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.850
 includes is now 4 gigs instead of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.920
 one of 2 gigas the 3d meter lights up 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.230
 without lighting with the clip also 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.270
 the stick is now a little lighter a 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.550
 little has a much more sensitive feel 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.200
 it's not as rough as the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.140
 of the previous model of something that is 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.700
 some players complained as I say the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.050
 buttons have also been modified are 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.140
 now a little bigger more 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.240
 rectangular and apart from that then good 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.990
 he explains a little more sensitive 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.650
 the pencil is quite bigger than in 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.480
 the previous model 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.340
 and the truth is that at the level of 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.390
 control it seems that this model so 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.299
 what we have been able to prove is a little 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.260
 more ergonomic does not occur the certain 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.019
 discomfort that some users 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.819
 indicated with the previous one with the model 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.870
 original 3DS now press the shakes 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.659
 it seems a little more comfortable 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.849
 and the control feels a bit more like a 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.980
 little more versatile at the level of 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.230
 resolution logically the increase of the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.519
 screen implies that the games are 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.870
 behave at the same resolution as the 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.330
 previous model and sometimes 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.180
 some flaws palpable at the level 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.940
 graphic that is more highlighted but 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.400
 this does not imply as in the model of more 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.840
 big of the original ds that they looked 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.190
 then a greater a greater amount of 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.500
 pixels in this case the truth the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.090
 result is surprising because many 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.829
 players expected the pixels to 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.989
 they will notice more but the truth is that they do not 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.600
 produces an effect too aggressive in 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.880
 regarding the visualization of the titles 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.550
 with respect to the console screen 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.680
 original 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.050
 if it appears we can compare a little this 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.060
 level model size with with 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.020
 the original console 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.030
 we have here a ps3 of that the model 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.400
 traditional and we can compare a little 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.300
 the size level with both the same 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.210
 game 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.330
 as this logically occurs 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.889
 90% expansion on the screen and 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.169
 design level of the new model with being 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.199
 a little less rough than aesthetically 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.349
 that the console in the original console 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.990
 who commented on the meter this meter 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.789
 As you know, if I move it a little, it does not have 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.470
 no type of click on the meter 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.810
 new yes it does a cap 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.430
 that prevents the three dimensions from 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.670
 activated involuntarily by 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.670
 of the player 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.580
 let's see the touch pen of the console that 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.010
 now it's hidden on the side instead 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.320
 from the part of the area as I say it is 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.420
 rather larger and does not include no 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.710
 includes the double position at the level of 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.710
 size once extended are usually 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.249
 similar but it is not the east does not include 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.979
 the double position 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:39.359
 the steel also looks like the 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.009
 again it seems a little lighter and another 

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.349
 something new is that the console includes 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.019
 an additional position reaches present 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.899
 the 3ds for the top screen we have 

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:50.339
 this one and we have this one that's the one 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:52.109
 in the normal 3ds and now it has 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:56.239
 incorporated is that this is not no 

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:56.239
 there is the normal 3ds 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.600
 and good as you see this is the new 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.630
 model that is not compatible with the 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.880
 profile of the pro pack of nintendo 3ds 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.140
 normal a review of 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.970
 also say what happened from the second 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.520
 stick that has included us as standard in the 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.380
 console but if it is compatible with it with 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.300
 the support of launched the kid icarus 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.250
 to support the truth works 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.840
 exactly like the one with the 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.390
 original console model does not 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.970
 displace what despite the increase 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.560
 of size does not suffer over 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.330
 displacements and as you see adjusts 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.960
 pretty good as well this is the 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.760
 new 3ds xl that will go on sale to 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.040
 end of this month specifically the day 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.530
 28 with an approximate price of 200 euros 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.150
 It also includes a few hours 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.450
 of battery marc which is quite a 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.880
 thank in the case of the 3ds and this what 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.200
 that we can teach with this opening of 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.940
 what is the box with one of the 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.940
 first 3ds keys he is coming to Spain
