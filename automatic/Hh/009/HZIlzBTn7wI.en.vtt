 Hello everyone , you are just delicious and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.480
 useful and today I want to tell you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.480
 how to make custard 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:23.189
 Well, let's start to cook our 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:27.140
 cream first you need to take 7 yolks of them 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.140
 you need to stir the sugar well to you 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 ok you need parents bet 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 get pretty thick mass 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.850
 so they'll send a little bit here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 cold milk 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 here I add a little vanilla in 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.500
 I was here where those packs 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.930
 isis and send flour 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.100
 well that's all i think is enough 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:18.420
 churn should get this 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:22.260
 condition vodka sour cream liquid therefore 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.020
 enough milk and I bring it almost to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.530
 boiling point but not milk 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 boil 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.310
 here now i'm gonna be here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.310
 add hot milk 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.900
 I got such a liquid 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.480
 mass and i open 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 construction site and now we will brew our 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:36.940
 cream I put all this liquid on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:44.200
 middle fire and now I will be all that 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.690
 boil cream need to cook until then 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 until you were so good it was to buy 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.200
 paddle 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.110
 Now I think that we have enough cream 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.909
 cooked here you see how good it was cool 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:18.440
 scoop and at the end of the welding of this cream 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:26.120
 you need 30 grams of butter and all 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:34.400
 well also stir everything i turn off 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:37.039
 horse butter is already well melted I still 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 I mix everything well and will deliver 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:46.150
 so that our cream will cool us 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.570
