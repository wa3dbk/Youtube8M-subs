00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.189
Hey, we got a front door facelift going on
here.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.269
I bought this for 100 bucks.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.360
My brother said he could find a better door,
just like it, for less than 100.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880
He lost the bet.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.480
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.570
I'm Allen Smith: join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.170
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410
Yeah, I think it's Cypress, Tony.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.220
It smells like it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.610
I'm really proud of this door.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.360
My brother and I have been going back and
forth about the front door.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.660
But I like to salvage things.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.070
And he does too.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.660
But I found this Cypress door in Memphis.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540
And I talked to a guy about it.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.800
And it had already been stripped.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760
It is a–you can see the colors of paint
that were on it.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.290
Probably at least a white.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.390
A cream.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.390
There's a green.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.390
A brown.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.390
Crazy.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.160
But anyway, it was mostly stripped, so there's
a lot of cost savings there.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549
Bought the door for 100 bucks.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.159
What I like about it: It's a five panel door.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.439
Two, three, four, five panels.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.229
And I like this slight panel.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.969
I think it fits the house really well.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.049
It's really old, I mean, it's probably from
1900 or so.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.520
Tony had just cut the top up there.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.380
And I couldn't–Cypress has a distinct aroma.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.899
And Cypress was used, as well as Pine, in
this part of the world.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.069
So I figured–we figured it was either Pine
or Cypress.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.719
Tony didn't think it was Pine, so I smelled
it up here and Cypress has a very Cypress-y

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.719
smell.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.920
And it is because he's made a fresh cut.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.210
So what's going on now is–what we're trying
to do: You see these panels are loose.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.219
See how they move back and forth a little
bit.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.539
So what the guys are doing is they're gonna
center these panels.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.819
And then what they'll do is caulk.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.140
And that will stabilize them.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.270
He'll make sure that each of one these panels
is centered, first, just like that.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.979
And then, you can see- look at this wood putty
that he's applying right here.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.030
Tony, excuse me just a minute, I'm gonna pull
this around.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.340
So, you can see, he's applied it here.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.530
This is his second application.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.951
He's just using a board and just applying
it.

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.100
Do you mind if I set, yeah.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.100
Thanks, Tony.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.510
So actually, it's just a piece of metal.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.720
And he's just applying like that to fill in
any holes.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.720
And this is…

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.930
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.360
So what you have here is a way of filling
in these different divots, scratches.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.640
There's a scratch here.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.000
There were- here's where the old knob was.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.110
Here's were the lock was.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.190
You know, nail holes.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.300
Anything like that.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.360
So he'll go over it.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
He'll let it dry.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.180
Let dry for 4 to 5 hours, sometimes a day.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.830
Knock it off with a little sandpaper.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.800
Hit it again, until he gets a good level.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.010
And what he's doing here is he's applying
a straight board right a long the edge, because

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.530
even the edge of this door was kind of rough.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.300
He's pushing that putty right against it.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.730
And what he'll be able to do is get a nice
clean edge like it was originally.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.760
And this stuff, I mean, it dries.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.310
When it dries it's really hard stuff.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.020
So once all that's done, and it gets sanded,
we'll be ready to paint it.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.090
And it will be primed and painted.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.351
And what he'll do is he's just got some temporary
hinges on it right now, just because he's

00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:24.800
building the door jamb.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.760
You see how nicely it closes?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.560
What he's trying to do is get it all squared
up.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.192
These will come off and then we'll find hinges
and hardware that fit with the rest of the

00:03:36.192 --> 00:03:37.720
house and he'll apply that.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.280
