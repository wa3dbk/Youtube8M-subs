if you're picking up guns and you don't
want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> use<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.940> animation<00:01:03.449> but

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
want to have to use that animation but

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
want to have to use that animation but
it's<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.220> helpful<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.850> doesn't<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it's pretty helpful and doesn't have to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
it's pretty helpful and doesn't have to
be<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.900> Call<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> Duty<00:01:07.380> lots<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> games<00:01:08.430> can

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
be for Call of Duty lots of games can

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
be for Call of Duty lots of games can
benefit<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.350> believe<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.860> was

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
benefit from this I believe it was

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.440 
benefit from this I believe it was
originally<00:01:11.430> developed<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.320> Halo<00:01:13.320> 2<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.450> got

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
originally developed for Halo 2 and got

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
originally developed for Halo 2 and got
popularize<00:01:16.110> popularized<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.430> game

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
popularize popularized from that game

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.070 
popularize popularized from that game
and<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:20.520> pretty<00:01:20.700> simple<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.450> looks<00:01:21.750> your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and so it's pretty simple it looks your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570 
and so it's pretty simple it looks your
hand<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> sort<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> shape<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hand is sort of in this shape on the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
hand is sort of in this shape on the
controller<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> said<00:01:25.409> before<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.009> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
controller as I said before you just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
controller as I said before you just
rest<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.880> thumb<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.900> stick<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rest your right thumb on this stick and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.340 
rest your right thumb on this stick and
the<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> remember<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the thing to remember about this is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.600 
the thing to remember about this is
people<00:01:31.350> hold<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> controller<00:01:32.189> differently

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
people hold the controller differently

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.399 
people hold the controller differently
but<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> played<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.110> sort<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but when I played in the sort of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
but when I played in the sort of
standard<00:01:34.590> grip<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.729> my<00:01:35.850> thumb<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> little

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
standard grip I put my thumb a little

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
standard grip I put my thumb a little
bit<00:01:36.390> farther<00:01:36.570> over<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> play

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bit farther over but when when I play

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
bit farther over but when when I play
claw<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.720> use<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> tip<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> my<00:01:40.890> thumb<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
claw I use more the tip of my thumb and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
claw I use more the tip of my thumb and
initially<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.090> felt<00:01:42.299> awkward<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.960> after<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
initially that felt awkward but after a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 
initially that felt awkward but after a
while<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:44.100> used<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> works

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
while I got used to it and and it works

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.350 
while I got used to it and and it works
out<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:47.009> pressing<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.610> X<00:01:48.000> Y<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> B

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
out and then for pressing the X Y a B
buttons<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.220> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> press

you feel most comfortable it doesn't

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.960 
you feel most comfortable it doesn't
really<00:02:16.680> matter<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:18.230> left<00:02:19.230> hand<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
really matter and then left hand is the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.360 
really matter and then left hand is the
same<00:02:21.210> as<00:02:21.560> same<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.680> anyone<00:02:22.920> else<00:02:23.100> would<00:02:23.220> grip

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390 
same as same as anyone else would grip
it<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.260> remember<00:02:26.010> though

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
it now what you have to remember though

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.540 
it now what you have to remember though
is<00:02:26.610> because<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:28.710> take<00:02:28.980> your<00:02:29.130> middle<00:02:29.250> finger

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
is because you take your middle finger

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.600 
is because you take your middle finger
off<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.330> controller<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:32.070> little<00:02:32.520> bit

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
off of the controller it's a little bit

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.750 
off of the controller it's a little bit
harder<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.110> grip<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.800> grip<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.400> pretty

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
harder to grip it so I grip it pretty

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
harder to grip it so I grip it pretty
lightly<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.300> my<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.750> hand<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.800> rest

the controller there I used to sort of

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.660 
the controller there I used to sort of
grip<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> controller<00:02:40.560> kind<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.860> hard<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.370> a
