just mind state of mind or was it also
engineering<00:01:03.120> processes<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.920> say

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
engineering processes now I will not say

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880 
engineering processes now I will not say
just<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> state<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.600> clearly<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just a state over here it clearly is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.880 
just a state over here it clearly is
bringing<00:01:08.520> us<00:01:08.640> into<00:01:08.820> new<00:01:09.060> territory<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
bringing us into new territory and the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
bringing us into new territory and the
one<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.390> teams<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
one thing that I think our teams have is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.330 
one thing that I think our teams have is
humility<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:14.960> say<00:01:15.960> when<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.290> need<00:01:16.560> external

humility to say when I need external

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
humility to say when I need external
there<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.270> no<00:01:18.390> point<00:01:18.630> trying<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.049> say<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> know

there is no point trying to say I know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
that's what we have done see as you know
that<00:01:50.280> Mahindra<00:01:51.270> has<00:01:51.600> been<00:01:51.720> criticized<00:01:52.170> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that Mahindra has been criticized for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.130 
that Mahindra has been criticized for
not<00:01:52.770> having<00:01:53.250> best<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> ridin<00:01:53.820> handling<00:01:54.140> its

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
not having best of ridin handling its

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.910 
not having best of ridin handling its
product<00:01:55.700> suspension<00:01:56.700> design<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.240> very

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
product suspension design is very

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.080 
product suspension design is very
complex<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.490> her<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.909> because

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
complex and when we get her up because

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
complex and when we get her up because
you<00:02:00.329> said<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.380> package<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you said right because the package you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
you said right because the package you
had<00:02:02.100> earlier<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.149> wheelbase<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> track

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
had earlier the wheelbase to the track

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
had earlier the wheelbase to the track
ratio<00:02:04.590> did<00:02:04.829> optimize<00:02:05.399> itself<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
ratio did optimize itself for right and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.270 
ratio did optimize itself for right and
so<00:02:06.540> when<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.840> say<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.619> didn't<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> best

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
so when we say we didn't have the best

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
so when we say we didn't have the best
of<00:02:08.369> ridin<00:02:08.640> handling<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.270> combination<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of ridin handling it's a combination of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.930 
of ridin handling it's a combination of
various<00:02:10.110> things<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.280> time<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
various things so this time all the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.130 
various things so this time all the
learning<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.540> had<00:02:12.720> from

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
learning that we had from

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.350 
learning that we had from
view<00:02:13.440> from<00:02:13.590> Shiloh<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.160> how<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.850> design<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
view from Shiloh on how to design the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.420 
view from Shiloh on how to design the
heart<00:02:15.540> points<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.530> kind<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.770> suspension<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
heart points what kind of suspension to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.680 
heart points what kind of suspension to
use<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.150> suspension<00:02:19.110> type<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.890> once<00:02:20.100> you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
use the the suspension type for once you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.000 
use the the suspension type for once you
hard<00:02:21.690> coded<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.319> very<00:02:22.470> difficult<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.890> change

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
hard coded it's very difficult to change

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.080 
hard coded it's very difficult to change
even<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> platform<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:25.709> defined<00:02:26.069> by<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.430> so

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
even the platform is defined by that so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.540 
even the platform is defined by that so
in<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:28.290> product<00:02:28.740> all<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.069> learning<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.400> we

in this product all the learning that we

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.190 
in this product all the learning that we
have<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> past<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.360> working<00:02:30.660> again<00:02:31.080> with

have in the past and working again with
the<00:02:31.290> consultant<00:02:31.830> rather<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:32.430> saying<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.730> know

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the consultant rather than saying I know

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.390 
the consultant rather than saying I know
it<00:02:32.970> all<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:34.020> designed<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.740> hard<00:02:34.950> points<00:02:35.310> we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
it all we designed the hard points we

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.980 
it all we designed the hard points we
designed<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> technology<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.270> suspension<00:02:36.840> up

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
designed the technology of suspension up

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.420 
designed the technology of suspension up
front<00:02:37.350> there's<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.100> first<00:02:38.280> thing

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
front there's one of the first thing

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.910 
front there's one of the first thing
that<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:38.640> decided<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:39.900> develop<00:02:40.620> from

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that we decided on and then develop from

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.350 
that we decided on and then develop from
there<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.930> got<00:02:43.080> our<00:02:43.230> first<00:02:44.010> mules<00:02:44.580> of

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
there and they got our first mules of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.380 
there and they got our first mules of
suspension<00:02:46.230> design<00:02:46.410> very<00:02:47.340> early<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.300> they

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
suspension design very early on so they

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 
suspension design very early on so they
could<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:48.810> use<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.350> long<00:02:49.980> pier<00:02:50.220> time<00:02:50.459> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
could then use a long pier time to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.640 
could then use a long pier time to
fine-tune<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.690> suspense<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.200> suspense<00:02:52.530> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
fine-tune the suspense in suspense and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.130 
fine-tune the suspense in suspense and
fine-tuning<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.100> an<00:02:53.190> art<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> first<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.050> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
fine-tuning is an art so first of the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.710 
fine-tuning is an art so first of the
heart<00:02:55.320> points<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.040> science<00:02:56.370> after

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
heart points that is science after

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.150 
heart points that is science after
hardpoints<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.200> nomenclature<00:02:58.980> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
hardpoints it's on the nomenclature and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.310 
hardpoints it's on the nomenclature and
this<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.550> last<00:02:59.700> question<00:02:59.970> does<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.900> hint

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
this my last question does it hint

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.850 
this my last question does it hint
towards<00:03:02.239> six<00:03:03.239> double<00:03:03.600> oh<00:03:03.750> seven<00:03:04.080> double<00:03:04.530> o<00:03:04.650> as

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
towards six double oh seven double o as

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.680 
towards six double oh seven double o as
we<00:03:05.040> go<00:03:05.190> forward<00:03:05.370> certainly<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.300> mean<00:03:06.540> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
we go forward certainly I mean it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.170 
we go forward certainly I mean it
doesn't<00:03:07.019> take<00:03:07.280> video<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> genius<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.150> guess

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
doesn't take video to a genius to guess

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.840 
doesn't take video to a genius to guess
that<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.810> XUV<00:03:10.440> five<00:03:10.769> double<00:03:11.130> O<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:11.760> have

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
that the XUV five double O we have

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.070 
that the XUV five double O we have
started<00:03:12.120> with<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.690> there<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:12.930> two<00:03:13.050> things

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
started with so there are two things

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.110 
started with so there are two things
that<00:03:13.350> we<00:03:13.560> are<00:03:13.590> doing<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:14.100> one<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:14.850> moving

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
that we are doing here one is moving

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.080 
that we are doing here one is moving
away<00:03:15.420> from<00:03:15.600> names<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.739> alpha<00:03:16.950> numeric<00:03:17.100> okay

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
away from names to alpha numeric okay

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.180 
away from names to alpha numeric okay
and<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.510> done<00:03:18.720> for<00:03:19.079> variety<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.980> reasons

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and that is done for variety of reasons

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.650 
and that is done for variety of reasons
one<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> which<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:23.510> alpha<00:03:24.510> numeric

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
one one of which is that alpha numeric

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.930 
one one of which is that alpha numeric
is<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> way<00:03:25.530> more<00:03:25.769> premium<00:03:26.100> more<00:03:26.430> sporty

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
is in a way more premium more sporty

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.870 
is in a way more premium more sporty
more<00:03:27.180> technology<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.860> second<00:03:29.340> also<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> that

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
more technology and second also a that

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.819 
more technology and second also a that
is<00:03:29.970> getting<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.290> difficult<00:03:31.410> to

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
is getting more and more difficult to

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.680 
is getting more and more difficult to
find<00:03:32.100> new<00:03:32.280> names<00:03:32.489> which<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.299> taken<00:03:33.570> by

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
find new names which are not taken by

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.300 
find new names which are not taken by
somebody<00:03:33.870> else<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.890> find<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.130> name<00:03:35.280> that
