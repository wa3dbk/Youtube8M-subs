00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.610
 to perform the following experiment 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:22.340
 we will need vinegar a glass and an egg 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.010
 all we have to do is fill 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.010
 the glass of vinegar 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 and introduce the egg into the glass 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:46.379
 Be careful not to break it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 the egg has to be covered 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.309
 vinegar we have no part of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.309
 egg out let's put some more 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.640
 ah 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.460
 and let the egg rest inside the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 recipient several days we can even 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 go changing the vinegar 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.920
 after having the egg inside the 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.920
 vinegar for three days we have this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.700
 It is an egg 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.100
 what a boot 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.729
 Here are several things have happened the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.869
 first the egg has lost the shell 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.390
 that's because the shell is 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.759
 formed by calcium carbonate that at 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.579
 put it in contact with the vinegar has 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.250
 given a chemical reaction and the shell 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.799
 has disappeared and calcium has formed 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.329
 that is was on the surface of the 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.390
 egg but we have removed it to clean it 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.360
 a little co2 are the little bubbles that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.830
 they came out on top of the vinegar and water that 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.549
 It was mixed with the vinegar that 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 we continue to have in the boat the 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.930
 second thing we can see that has 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.840
 past is that the egg if we compare it 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 with a normal one it has increased in size 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 because when losing the shell it has been 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.129
 the next layer that is what makes 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.599
 still have egg form this layer 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.030
 when we open we split it a 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.879
 egg is sometimes seen as a telita of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.830
 more or less transparent color and is the 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.470
 that we still have here is 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 a bed is a semipermeable layer that 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.220
 it means that it lets water pass 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.650
 inside the egg or out 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.099
 in this case like inside the egg 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 there were more salts and more things the water 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.780
 what I did was to go inland 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.180
 of the layer so that the amount of salts 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.239
 was equal to the outside that was very 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.920
 low that's why water and the egg came in 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.019
 what I have done has been inflating and as 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.380
 this layer is a little elastic has 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.330
 increased in size 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.890
 and the last question is what is it that 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 is inside the egg why is it 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.640
 rubber is not rigid and we have several 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.970
 things 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.800
 the clear when entering water inwards has 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.350
 entered with a little bit of vinegar and the 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.319
 clear it has denatured that we say 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 it is as if the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.209
 proteins that form it have changed 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.840
 way and they have given this consistency 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.819
 that is not rigid that is rubber but in 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.720
 I change the yolk that is inside 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.680
 if you see it 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.680
 backlight 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.140
 it looks better 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.700
 If you have it at home, you will see it better than 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.710
 not here in the video 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.380
 as you go, the egg remains 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.560
 bud you will always see it in the part of 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.980
 up moves on the inside 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.780
 the yolk but still normal is to say yes 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.730
 we puncture the egg the yolk 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.530
 it would still be liquid because the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.140
 vinegar yet and that has entered the clear 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.800
 and has transformed it to say it of 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.480
 somehow the yolk is still intact and 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.210
 is floating here in the middle if you see it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.850
 you see here a little more orange 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.430
 and as much as I move the egg 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.639
 I still have here on top 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.229
 and nothing more if you see strange things like this 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.080
 that there are here sometimes when we start from 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.580
 an egg comes out a little blood that is 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.830
 because it is still the egg of the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.009
 hen but good until here the 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.780
 experiment of the egg with vinegar that is 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.780
 an egg that bounces
