00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
round in the box of the last five
minutes<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.860> knew<00:01:56.130> we'll<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.610> but

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
minutes because we knew we'll see if but

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.230 
minutes because we knew we'll see if but
yesterday<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:58.340> when<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.430> went<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> nil<00:02:00.000> down

and<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.810> hit<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> deck<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.829> how<00:02:02.490> long<00:02:02.700> hard<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and I hit the deck and how long hard I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.050 
and I hit the deck and how long hard I
thought<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.360> were<00:02:03.770> then<00:02:04.770> buried<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
thought we were then buried really it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.160 
thought we were then buried really it
was<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> lot<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> combat<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.110> was

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
was a lot of combat I think there was

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.770 
was a lot of combat I think there was
only<00:02:07.290> 15<00:02:07.770> minutes<00:02:07.950> left<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.479> we've

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
only 15 minutes left but you know we've

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.300 
only 15 minutes left but you know we've
got<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.170> back<00:02:10.379> straightaway<00:02:10.739> then<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
got a go back straightaway then you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.500 
got a go back straightaway then you
could<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> belief<00:02:12.209> was

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
could see that the belief was

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.929 
could see that the belief was
coming<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:14.099> could<00:02:14.310> Nick<00:02:14.489> one<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939
