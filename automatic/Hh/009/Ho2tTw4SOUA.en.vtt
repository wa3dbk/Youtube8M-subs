that's<00:02:49.140> probably<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> noise<00:02:49.829> of<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.069> loss

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's probably what the noise of a loss

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.220 
that's probably what the noise of a loss
would<00:02:50.579> make<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:51.120> least<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.359> think<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.049> noise

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
would make at least I think it's a noise

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.509 
would make at least I think it's a noise
of<00:02:52.379> loss<00:02:52.530> you're<00:02:52.680> up<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:52.980> make<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.430> know

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
of loss you're up to it make you know

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.619
