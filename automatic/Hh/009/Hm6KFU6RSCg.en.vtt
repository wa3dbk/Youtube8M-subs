going into some minecraft 12w 27a and
some<00:00:27.990> 1.3<00:00:28.619> news<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:30.080> let's<00:00:31.080> get<00:00:31.529> started<00:00:31.859> first

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
some 1.3 news so let's get started first

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.440 
some 1.3 news so let's get started first
thing<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:34.640> optimization<00:00:35.640> has<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.390> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
thing is that optimization has kind of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
thing is that optimization has kind of
become<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.780> key<00:00:37.140> word<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> update<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
become a key word in this update in the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.799 
become a key word in this update in the
sense<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.899> apparently<00:00:40.730> stuff<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.629> be

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sense of that apparently stuff is to be

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.590 
sense of that apparently stuff is to be
regenerated<00:00:43.469> faster<00:00:43.890> apparently<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.789> don't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
regenerated faster apparently I don't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.200 
regenerated faster apparently I don't
know<00:00:45.870> exactly<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.379> they're<00:00:46.500> doing<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.890> but

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
know exactly how they're doing it but

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
know exactly how they're doing it but
it's<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.510> supposed<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.399> smoother<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it's all supposed to be smoother as you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's all supposed to be smoother as you
see<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.059> though<00:00:51.210> I'm<00:00:51.390> lagging<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> bit

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
see here though I'm lagging out a bit

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.840 
see here though I'm lagging out a bit
when<00:00:53.309> loading<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.180> chunks<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.530> something<00:00:56.100> 1.4

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
when loading up chunks so something 1.4

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.209 
when loading up chunks so something 1.4
talk<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> too<00:00:57.960> however<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.010> sure

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
talk about that too however I'm sure

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
talk about that too however I'm sure
there<00:00:59.430> will<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.730> minor<00:01:00.329> bug<00:01:00.600> fixes<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there will be more minor bug fixes and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.630 
there will be more minor bug fixes and
minor<00:01:01.350> stuff<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> along<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> way<00:01:03.170> so

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
minor stuff like that along the way so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
minor stuff like that along the way so
not<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> huge<00:01:06.180> update<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
not a huge update will go into the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.250 
not a huge update will go into the
update<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.040> we'll<00:01:08.189> talk<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> 1.3

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
update and then we'll talk about the 1.3

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
update and then we'll talk about the 1.3
update<00:01:10.770> news<00:01:11.010> instead<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.360> snapshot

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
update news instead of just the snapshot

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
update news instead of just the snapshot
so<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> start<00:01:13.590> pistons<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> redstone<00:01:14.820> were

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so to start pistons and redstone were

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
so to start pistons and redstone were
kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> different<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.470> may<00:01:16.799> be

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
kind of a different thing this may be

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700 
kind of a different thing this may be
difficult<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> don't<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
difficult to see I don't know but it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
difficult to see I don't know but it
talked<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:20.189> repeaters<00:01:21.110> infecting<00:01:22.110> pistons

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
talked about repeaters infecting pistons

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.749 
talked about repeaters infecting pistons
and<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> set<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.479> rig<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
and so I set up a little rig here and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
and so I set up a little rig here and
you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> pretty<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.290> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you can pretty much see that it is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
you can pretty much see that it is
faster<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.549> redstone

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
faster with the the one just redstone

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.480 
faster with the the one just redstone
and<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> stage<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.159> should

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and this is a stage one so this should

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
and this is a stage one so this should
not<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.600> redstone<00:01:36.869> knowledge<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
not from my redstone knowledge have a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
not from my redstone knowledge have a
delay<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.180> however<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:39.990> not

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
delay like that however this will not

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 
delay like that however this will not
affect<00:01:40.460> major<00:01:41.460> things<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.030> believe

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
affect major things I don't believe

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.190 
affect major things I don't believe
because<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.880> mean<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.090> almost<00:01:45.509> instant<00:01:46.079> with

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
because I mean it's almost instant with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080 
because I mean it's almost instant with
each<00:01:46.320> other<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.340> slight<00:01:47.759> delay

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
each other it's just that slight delay

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
each other it's just that slight delay
however<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.369> next

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
however when you just have it right next

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.200 
however when you just have it right next
to<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:52.070> does<00:01:53.070> sometimes<00:01:53.670> does<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to it does sometimes does that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.120 
to it does sometimes does that
teleporting<00:01:54.899> thing<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> saw<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.590> second

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
teleporting thing if you saw that second

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
teleporting thing if you saw that second
there<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> where<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.810> bug

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
there it is where that's kind of a bug

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
there it is where that's kind of a bug
where<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.439> won't<00:01:58.619> show<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> animation<00:01:59.310> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
where it won't show the animation of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.300 
where it won't show the animation of
going<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.360> it'll<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.950> quickly<00:02:01.950> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
going up it'll just quickly like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
going up it'll just quickly like
teleport<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.219> see<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.909> you'll

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
teleport up like that and see and you'll

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.419 
teleport up like that and see and you'll
go<00:02:06.990> back<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.350> normally<00:02:07.740> always<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.280> that's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
go back out normally always so that's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.650 
go back out normally always so that's
kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.849> bug<00:02:09.030> thing<00:02:09.270> needs<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.590> work<00:02:10.739> out

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
kind of a bug thing needs to work out

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.790 
kind of a bug thing needs to work out
other<00:02:12.660> cool<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.500> this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
other cool thing this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.840 
other cool thing this
I'm<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.430> very<00:02:14.730> excited<00:02:14.970> about<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.100> signs<00:02:17.100> now

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.360 

let's<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.260> generally<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> sign<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:23.070> how

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
let's do this generally a sign is how

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.510 
let's do this generally a sign is how
you<00:02:23.430> build<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.540> sign<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.530> makes<00:02:25.860> three

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you build one sign now makes three

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
you build one sign now makes three
that's<00:02:26.970> right<00:02:27.180> signs<00:02:27.600> are<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.020> stackable<00:02:28.710> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's right signs are now stackable and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.090 
that's right signs are now stackable and
they<00:02:29.070> come<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.460> threes<00:02:29.730> instead<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
they come in threes instead of that and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.850 
they come in threes instead of that and
your<00:02:32.100> color<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.850> wood<00:02:33.120> will<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:33.840> affect<00:02:34.680> your

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
your color of wood will not affect your

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.620 
your color of wood will not affect your
sign<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.340> use<00:02:35.460> any<00:02:35.670> color<00:02:35.880> would<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.570> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
sign you can use any color would if you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.930 
sign you can use any color would if you
want<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> make<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.310> heck<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.460> think<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.730> even

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
want to make it heck I think you even

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.030 
want to make it heck I think you even
mix<00:02:39.560> colors<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.890> let's<00:02:41.070> get<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:43.040> yep

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
mix colors here let's get it up yep

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.550 
mix colors here let's get it up yep
doesn't<00:02:44.880> matter<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.360> goes<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.910> 16

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
doesn't matter and that goes up to 16

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.940 
doesn't matter and that goes up to 16
signs<00:02:49.560> /<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:51.120> little<00:02:51.750> stack<00:02:52.200> kind<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.680> eggs

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
signs / a little stack kind of like eggs

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.740 
signs / a little stack kind of like eggs
so<00:02:53.880> sleep<00:02:54.300> 16<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.200> all's<00:02:55.980> good<00:02:56.750> apparently

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
so sleep 16 to all's good apparently

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.530 
so sleep 16 to all's good apparently
something<00:02:58.020> also<00:02:58.380> about<00:02:58.590> how<00:02:59.240> before<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.360> had

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
something also about how before you had

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.790 
something also about how before you had
chances<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.200> signs<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:03.290> kind<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.380> resetting

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
chances of signs like kind of resetting

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.070 
chances of signs like kind of resetting
themselves<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.300> server<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.780> bit<00:03:06.900> laggy

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
themselves if the server is a bit laggy

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.020 
themselves if the server is a bit laggy
or<00:03:07.320> something<00:03:07.680> slaggy<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.580> apparently<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
or something slaggy and apparently that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.470 
or something slaggy and apparently that
bugs<00:03:09.330> been<00:03:09.570> fixed<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.280> final<00:03:11.760> kind<00:03:12.360> of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
bugs been fixed and so the final kind of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.960 
bugs been fixed and so the final kind of
major<00:03:12.720> bug<00:03:13.410> thing<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.920> potions<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:14.640> in

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
major bug thing is that potions now in

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
breaking away from single player and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840 
breaking away from single player and
still<00:04:32.720> single<00:04:32.990> player<00:04:33.320> mode<00:04:33.650> but<00:04:34.370> putting<00:04:34.610> it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
on an outer multiplayer shell now that

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.800 
on an outer multiplayer shell now that
means<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:37.729> that<00:04:37.759> that's<00:04:38.330> going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.539> be<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
means is that that's going to be the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.140 
means is that that's going to be the
whole<00:04:38.960> local<00:04:39.320> area<00:04:39.650> network<00:04:40.009> allowing<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.759> so

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
whole local area network allowing it so

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.090 
whole local area network allowing it so
that<00:04:41.300> your<00:04:41.479> single<00:04:42.050> player<00:04:42.440> will<00:04:42.680> actually

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
that your single player will actually

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.090 
that your single player will actually
run<00:04:43.280> through<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> multiplayer<00:04:44.570> server<00:04:45.100> but

run through a multiplayer server but

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.969 
run through a multiplayer server but
it's<00:04:46.250> still<00:04:46.970> single<00:04:47.660> player<00:04:47.960> unless<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.500> make

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
it's still single player unless you make

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.279 
it's still single player unless you make
it<00:04:49.190> available<00:04:49.520> through<00:04:50.150> your<00:04:50.419> network<00:04:50.720> if<00:04:51.139> you
