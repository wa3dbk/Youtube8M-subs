disadvantages the only ones that i can
notice<00:05:18.030> is<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.300> whenever<00:05:19.230> out<00:05:19.740> there's<00:05:20.669> a

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
notice is that whenever out there's a

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.110 
notice is that whenever out there's a
big<00:05:21.169> obvious<00:05:22.190> line<00:05:23.190> right<00:05:23.490> there<00:05:23.669> where<00:05:24.000> they

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
big obvious line right there where they

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.800 
big obvious line right there where they
put<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.360> together<00:05:24.450> hey<00:05:24.720> Arthur<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:26.210> big<00:05:27.210> obvious

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
put it together hey Arthur a big obvious

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.960 
put it together hey Arthur a big obvious
line<00:05:28.380> right<00:05:28.590> there<00:05:28.740> where<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.220> life

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
line right there where this life

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.450 
line right there where this life
together<00:05:30.240> i<00:05:30.510> mean<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.620> could<00:05:31.860> be<00:05:32.070> like

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
together i mean it it could be like

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.610 
together i mean it it could be like
consistence<00:05:33.180> is<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.540> second<00:05:33.840> part<00:05:34.080> started

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
consistence is the second part started

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.900 
consistence is the second part started
taking<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.010> schools<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.730> best

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
taking the schools that the best

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.870 
taking the schools that the best

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
position what this is designed back this

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.720 
position what this is designed back this
um<00:05:39.200> I'm<00:05:40.200> this<00:05:40.380> could<00:05:40.590> have<00:05:40.710> been<00:05:40.740> like<00:05:40.950> all<00:05:41.160> 10
