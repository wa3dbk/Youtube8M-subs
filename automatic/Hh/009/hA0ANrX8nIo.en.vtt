00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.880 

well<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.250> just<00:00:02.639> bought<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.419> tachometer<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.319> eBay

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
well I just bought a tachometer on eBay

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.860 
well I just bought a tachometer on eBay
so<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> figured<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.970> should<00:00:06.000> probably<00:00:06.390> get<00:00:06.690> one

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
so I figured I should probably get one

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
so I figured I should probably get one
when<00:00:07.560> working<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:07.859> these<00:00:07.980> old<00:00:08.189> an<00:00:08.400> juicers

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
when working on these old an juicers

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.919 
when working on these old an juicers
have<00:00:08.940> very<00:00:09.630> specific<00:00:10.019> rpm<00:00:10.769> ratings<00:00:11.360> so<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.719> was

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
have very specific rpm ratings so I was

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.440 
have very specific rpm ratings so I was
looking<00:00:13.080> online<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.559> found<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.250> cheap<00:00:15.120> cheap

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
looking online I found this cheap cheap

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.599 
looking online I found this cheap cheap
cheap<00:00:15.980> laser<00:00:16.980> tachometer<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.720> 25<00:00:19.140> bucks

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
cheap laser tachometer this was 25 bucks

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.599 
cheap laser tachometer this was 25 bucks
and<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.850> does<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.779> good<00:00:21.900> job<00:00:22.400> it's<00:00:23.400> got

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and it does a pretty good job it's got

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.620 
and it does a pretty good job it's got
air<00:00:24.420> reading<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.580> 0.05<00:00:26.580> percent<00:00:26.849> which<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
air reading of 0.05 percent which is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.290 
air reading of 0.05 percent which is
very<00:00:28.109> good<00:00:32.750> here<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.160> it's<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.399> memory<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
very good here it is it's got memory and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
very good here it is it's got memory and
then<00:00:36.420> test<00:00:37.399> looks<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> laser<00:00:38.850> pointer

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then test looks like a laser pointer

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.950 
then test looks like a laser pointer
always<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.309> an<00:00:41.489> engine<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.510> put

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
always and so on an engine you just put

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020 
always and so on an engine you just put
this<00:00:43.200> reflective<00:00:43.860> tape<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.340> something<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
this reflective tape on something that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
this reflective tape on something that
moves<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> governor<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
moves I have it on the governor of this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.660 
moves I have it on the governor of this
rigid<00:00:47.940> stratum<00:00:48.270> ofh<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.570> goes<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
rigid stratum ofh so when this goes by I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.950 
rigid stratum ofh so when this goes by I
guess<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.910> reads<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> somehow<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.960> anyway

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
guess this reads it somehow but anyway

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.020 
guess this reads it somehow but anyway
I'll<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.949> demo<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.760> start

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
I'll do a little demo see like I start

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689 
I'll do a little demo see like I start
this<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> way<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> see

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this up and by the way on it you can see

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.660 
this up and by the way on it you can see
that<00:01:02.730> thermal<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.629> anything<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.549> really

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that thermal or anything but it's really

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
that thermal or anything but it's really
cold<00:01:05.939> outside<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.170> minus<00:01:07.680> five<00:01:08.189> or

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
cold outside it's like minus five or

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
cold outside it's like minus five or
something<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:12.000> dog<00:01:12.920> anyway<00:01:13.920> I'll

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
something and there's my dog anyway I'll

00:01:14.130 --> 00:02:38.050 
something and there's my dog anyway I'll
start<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.520> up

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.089 

well<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:40.140> how<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.469> works

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
well that's how it works

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.709 
well that's how it works
this<00:02:41.969> memory<00:02:42.359> function<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.709> press<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.310> hold

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
this memory function you press and hold

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.410 
this memory function you press and hold
gives<00:02:45.719> you<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> maximum<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
gives you the maximum and then the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.069 
gives you the maximum and then the
minimum<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.450> highly

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
minimum so there it is I highly

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.390 
minimum so there it is I highly
recommend<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.739> con<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.159> don't<00:02:53.310> already

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
recommend a con if you don't already

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.479 
recommend a con if you don't already
have<00:02:53.519> one<00:02:54.260> no<00:02:55.260> small<00:02:55.620> engine<00:02:55.950> repair<00:02:56.310> man

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
have one no small engine repair man

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.539 
have one no small engine repair man
could<00:02:57.120> ever<00:02:57.209> go<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.340> there<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.459> go

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
could ever go that one so there you go

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.299 
could ever go that one so there you go
it's<00:02:59.760> 95<00:03:00.090> bucks
