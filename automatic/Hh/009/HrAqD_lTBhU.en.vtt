open<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.340> not

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
open right there there's actually not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
open right there there's actually not
the<00:01:20.880> second<00:01:21.210> layer<00:01:21.299> open<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> doesn't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the second layer open but that doesn't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
the second layer open but that doesn't
really<00:01:22.350> matter<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.890> looks<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> minions

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really matter so looks like a minions

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
really matter so looks like a minions
are<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.299> gonna<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.900> gold<00:01:25.170> right

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
are actually gonna take that gold right

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.289 
are actually gonna take that gold right
there<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> dark<00:01:26.670> elixir<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:27.119> not

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
there now about the dark elixir I'm not

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
there now about the dark elixir I'm not
too<00:01:27.479> sure<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.200> gonna<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> getting<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
too sure if we're gonna be getting that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
too sure if we're gonna be getting that
and<00:01:29.310> let's<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.900> happens

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and let's go and see what happens

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
and let's go and see what happens
so<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.250> any<00:01:32.400> clásica<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so what do we have any clásica so I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
so what do we have any clásica so I
think<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.420> minions<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> whatnot<00:01:34.500> out

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
think we have minions and whatnot out

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380 
think we have minions and whatnot out
balloons<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> play<00:01:36.329> some

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
balloons so we're going to play some

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
balloons so we're going to play some
minions<00:01:36.720> right<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.159> pray

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
minions right here as well and it's pray

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
minions right here as well and it's pray
for<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> troops<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> actually<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
for the troops to actually go in the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
for the troops to actually go in the
center<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.439> might<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> dark

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
center I might actually get the dark

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910 
center I might actually get the dark
elixir<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.329> these<00:01:43.320> defenses<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
elixir because these defenses that are

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.740 
elixir because these defenses that are
actually<00:01:44.220> firing<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:44.939> aren't<00:01:45.149> really

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
actually firing at me aren't really

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.929 
actually firing at me aren't really
upgraded<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.430> aren't<00:01:47.640> as

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
upgraded and they really aren't as

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
upgraded and they really aren't as
strong<00:01:48.240> enough<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.649> hero's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
strong enough to you know take my hero's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
strong enough to you know take my hero's
dad<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.970> article<00:01:51.329> shooting<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> wall

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
dad so my article shooting on the wall

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.800 
dad so my article shooting on the wall
and<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> King<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.680> uh<00:01:53.420> hitting<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> wall<00:01:54.720> as

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and the King is uh hitting on a wall as

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
and the King is uh hitting on a wall as
well<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.500> uh<00:01:55.530> let's<00:01:56.460> wait<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.850> they

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
well and uh let's wait and see what they

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
well and uh let's wait and see what they
do<00:01:57.299> right<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.259> turn<00:01:58.740> smart<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
do right here if they turn smart or

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.560 
do right here if they turn smart or
something<00:01:59.549> okay<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> King<00:02:00.360> actually

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
something okay so the King actually

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
something okay so the King actually
realizes<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.530> Queen<00:02:01.860> finally<00:02:02.820> gets<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
realizes that the Queen finally gets a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.639 
realizes that the Queen finally gets a
that<00:02:03.360> probably<00:02:03.719> he<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:03.960> trying<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> help<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that probably he was trying to help the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.620 
that probably he was trying to help the
Queen<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.090> 69%

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
Queen to get in all right so we are 69%

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359 
Queen to get in all right so we are 69%
going<00:02:07.320> some<00:02:07.500> minions<00:02:07.799> right<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.220> take

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
going some minions right here to take

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
going some minions right here to take
that<00:02:08.550> gold<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.899> Marsha

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that gold out right there now Marsha

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.600 
that gold out right there now Marsha
queen<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.400> wall

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
queen is actually going at that wall

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.830 
queen is actually going at that wall
right<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.879> which<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.090> exactly<00:02:12.330> what<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
right there which is exactly what I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.240 
right there which is exactly what I
wanted

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
wanted

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.830 
wanted
do<00:02:13.340> because<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> dark<00:02:13.910> elixir<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.600> way

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
do because the dark elixir is that way

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.810 
do because the dark elixir is that way
right<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.070> gold<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> going<00:02:16.550> down

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
right there so the gold is going down

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.310 
right there so the gold is going down
right<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.210> king<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.660> gonna<00:02:17.720> go<00:02:17.930> for<00:02:18.200> that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
right now the king is gonna go for that

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.540 
right now the king is gonna go for that
air<00:02:18.470> defense<00:02:18.500> right<00:02:18.890> there<00:02:18.980> I'm<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.430> go

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
air defense right there I'm just go

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.040 
air defense right there I'm just go
ahead<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.910> put<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:20.270> both<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> ability

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
ahead and put them both in the ability

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.380 
ahead and put them both in the ability
and<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.740> should<00:02:22.220> actually<00:02:22.520> get<00:02:22.940> me<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.180> dark

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and that should actually get me the dark

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.410 
and that should actually get me the dark
elixir<00:02:23.510> right<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:24.800> well<00:02:25.790> yeah<00:02:26.390> I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
elixir right there so one well yeah I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.340 
elixir right there so one well yeah I
don't<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> count<00:02:27.050> for<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> heads

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
don't really have to count for the heads

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.750 
don't really have to count for the heads
because<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:27.920> gonna<00:02:28.010> take<00:02:28.220> forever<00:02:28.430> all

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
because it's just gonna take forever all

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040 
because it's just gonna take forever all
right<00:02:28.880> guys<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.150> there<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.360> go<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
right guys so there we go we have the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.300 
right guys so there we go we have the
dark<00:02:30.170> elixir<00:02:30.350> I'm<00:02:30.680> gonna<00:02:30.890> end<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> batter

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
dark elixir I'm gonna end the batter

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.370 
dark elixir I'm gonna end the batter
right<00:02:31.459> here<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.420> was<00:02:32.930> pretty<00:02:33.200> awesome

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
right here so that was pretty awesome

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.050 
right here so that was pretty awesome
guys<00:02:33.709> we<00:02:33.830> got<00:02:33.950> all<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.220> loots<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.910> didn't

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
guys we got all the loots we didn't

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.580 
guys we got all the loots we didn't
actually<00:02:35.180> all<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> elixir<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.380> doesn't

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
actually all the elixir but that doesn't

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.750 
actually all the elixir but that doesn't
really<00:02:36.650> matter<00:02:36.860> we're<00:02:37.130> not<00:02:37.250> really<00:02:37.400> farming

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
really matter we're not really farming

wouldn't going from the bottom of here

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
less about the elixir right now so it's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.900 
less about the elixir right now so it's
gonna<00:03:06.470> go<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.070> from<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.370> bottom<00:03:07.700> right

here just so the balloon spreading out

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.860 
here just so the balloon spreading out
like<00:03:10.040> this<00:03:10.250> minions<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.390> back<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.690> them

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
like this minions in the back of them

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.540 
like this minions in the back of them
and<00:03:12.140> let's<00:03:12.440> go<00:03:12.530> ahead<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.770> go<00:03:12.860> bridge<00:03:13.250> them

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
and let's go ahead and go bridge them

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.310 
and let's go ahead and go bridge them
right<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.209> rage<00:03:14.510> right<00:03:14.660> there<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.110> one

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
on the outside which is not a good idea

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
on the outside which is not a good idea
because<00:03:18.830> that's<00:03:19.700> automatically<00:03:20.269> gonna<00:03:20.450> go

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
because that's automatically gonna go

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
so that's exactly what I'll be doing

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.520 
so that's exactly what I'll be doing
today<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.580> Wiz<00:04:25.789> towers<00:04:26.030> because<00:04:26.240> I

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
today the Wiz towers because I

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.620 
today the Wiz towers because I
you<00:04:26.590> think<00:04:26.860> they<00:04:26.980> look<00:04:27.160> cool<00:04:27.430> but<00:04:27.790> aside<00:04:28.420> from

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you think they look cool but aside from

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.600 
you think they look cool but aside from
looking<00:04:28.840> cool<00:04:29.260> they<00:04:29.500> also<00:04:29.650> do<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.889> great<00:04:30.190> job<00:04:30.430> on

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
looking cool they also do a great job on

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.550 
looking cool they also do a great job on
attacking<00:04:31.000> erring<00:04:31.510> ground<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> same<00:04:32.260> time

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
attacking erring ground at the same time

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.680
