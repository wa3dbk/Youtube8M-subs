00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the Saffiano leather which is more of a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
the Saffiano leather which is more of a
firm<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.750> sturdy<00:00:52.140> leather

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
firm and sturdy leather

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.819 
firm and sturdy leather
I've<00:00:53.340> seen<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.149> Hamilton<00:00:54.629> bags<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I've seen some Hamilton bags and the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
I've seen some Hamilton bags and the
leather<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> lot<00:00:56.610> lighter<00:00:57.050> softer<00:00:58.050> lighter

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
leather is a lot lighter softer lighter

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.180 
leather is a lot lighter softer lighter
it's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.280> lot<00:00:59.460> softer<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.140> rather<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it's a lot softer but I rather have the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
it's a lot softer but I rather have the
more<00:01:02.430> firm<00:01:02.789> leather<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.110> hold

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
more firm leather so that it would hold

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.730 
more firm leather so that it would hold
its<00:01:04.589> shape<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.439> durable

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
its shape and it would be more durable

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.250 
its shape and it would be more durable
because<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.760> am<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> know

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
because I am on the go I'm you know

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.649 
because I am on the go I'm you know
career<00:01:14.010> woman<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> bag

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
career woman and you know you need a bag

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.749 
career woman and you know you need a bag
that's<00:01:15.900> gonna<00:01:16.110> hold<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.930> roughness

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
that's gonna hold up to your roughness

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's gonna hold up to your roughness
so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> felt<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.590> hold<00:01:22.770> up

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so I felt like that this would hold up

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.940 
so I felt like that this would hold up
to<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:24.000> roughness<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.530> three

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to my roughness and here we are three

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.420 
to my roughness and here we are three
months<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> line<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.689> any
