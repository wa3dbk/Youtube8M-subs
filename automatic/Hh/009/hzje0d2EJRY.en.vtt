00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.210
 there are very good and truffle wanted 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.490
 commenting and today finally again come back 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.070
 to modern warfare channel 3 an app that 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.959
 good is with the cr but good as it was 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.980
 very long time I did not play the truth 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.139
 is that it has surprised me because in the 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.090
 second part I played alone and ostia 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.280
 Well , with the cheto de la cr , I do not know 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.080
 get a love and good because I wanted to bring 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.970
 it's a gameplay and I said it's time I'm going to 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.470
 put the advantages specialist that is 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.570
 very easy to remove it as 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.760
 you know and well I'm going to talk a 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.400
 little bit about the game you already know what is 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.739
 the game that my channel started with 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 to gain fame is supposed because one already 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.850
 explains that at the beginning it would be assembly and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.800
 all that for a few years and 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.359
 half to start from this game to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.999
 comment the impression since I also 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.170
 played black ops 1 and such and it occurred to me 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.429
 the idea of ​​commenting on the implicit 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.739
 good to upload that print from 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.239
 comment on them first and we hope 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.679
 warfare 3 and I'll start with this game 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.420
 to go up in play if you hear it was the 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.859
 first game that I started to climb the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.260
 beginning we climbed but it went up 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.300
 good match good and good games 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.609
 markers and such and then the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.910
 fashions not that it was what most people 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.250
 he brought her over with all the weapons 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 put snipers shotguns of the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 rifles of the secondary rifles 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.720
 with manu did not promote the friend frank and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.490
 stacks and well it is a game that to me 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.590
 As you know I like it but I like it better 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.560
 the black ops twice this game then 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.780
 the only one the only downside that I see this 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
 game is that for example the cr is a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 Weapon a little bit checked that good 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.840
 this allegedly you put it 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.520
 but it has not played for a long time 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.900
 I wanted to get a good game and this is 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.009
 the weapon indicated because it kills me 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.330
 very much the visit is also a 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.979
 poquillo dopada I think they need it 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.420
 better than acr more than anything for the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.490
 movement that you have not because of my style of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.630
 game in the end is an imply is not in 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.860
 rus how can my gameplays be 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.990
 whites 2 because it's been a long time since 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.210
 he agreed he answers all that and also 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 is a broad domain not in domain 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 what he was trying in this case was 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
 try skins the whole case of respawn 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.660
 how are you seeing then good is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.160
 interest to see how it takes to make it 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
 I have a point and silencer I know that 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.770
 Many of us like to wear it with knit 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.899
 you directly prefer extended charger 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.729
 but good as I played competitive 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.979
 I got used to playing 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.300
 red dot and it's not really necessary 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.560
 but good to not go wrong that I walk 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.789
 a lot with his peephole that made a 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.380
 time that in the welcome it catches me 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.780
 the red dot 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 So without further ado I leave background we are 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.030
 here and as I tell you I 'm going to talk a 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.680
 a little bit of the things that I do not like about 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.780
 this game for example what we do not see 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.250
 nothingness is the gusts of deaths that already 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.000
 they put in modern warfare 2 like 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.100
 explain the other time 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.020
 for example the hand of the deceased that 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.820
 It is not very annoying too much because 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.590
 with the specialist and if you are aware 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.660
 and health even if you're not in the face 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.520
 kill is because you wear the vest is a 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 little weird that he kills you but good fuck you 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.160
 not the truth that it fusses a lot but what 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.320
 What the fuck is the last good battle 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.510
 the final battle that that then for 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.220
 me is a bitch of the host and then 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 Well, apart from the killer that can not be 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.340
 have absolutely nothing 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.260
 because it is impossible to see them in this game 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.670
 do not help you know it, do not you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.440
 affect the uncle or the sensors 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.870
 movement and none of that so the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.460
 killer is pretty tied then it's 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.870
 a pretty spellbound advantage and such what 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.070
 I do like this game very much 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.930
 but a lot and it's going to come back as 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.370
 you know in the last cable is the streak 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.980
 specialist and also in the goal to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.870
 put 35 advantages finally then 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 imagine what the payment is going to come out with 35 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.350
 advantages I know that some as well as 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.790
 you know in this game there are advantages but 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.590
 that is to say that there are advantages that are like 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.600
 doubles in the game there are no advantages 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.690
 but that is to say they have divided the advantages 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.170
 for example, quick-drawn but not 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.410
 for example is sheathed quickly what 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.790
 to aim faster and in but if not 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.319
 I was wrong was to throw the team more 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.440
 quick something like that, not because they're going to 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.870
 do as in two in two parts not in 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.819
 two advantages and I do not know the truth that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.290
 contention advantages the doll walked 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.180
 besides, it is humanly advantages 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.709
 new as always so it's enough 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.030
 quite a lot of water and also it will come back 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.020
 how are you seeing the secondary weapon 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.330
 that I have not had with all the 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.040
 gameplay takes the magnum goes back the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.080
 hand I wanted more not so that aside 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.819
 for also to make them moab according to 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.790
 as I understand there are two types of 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.989
 how I explained first the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.239
 bet that is achieved by doing 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.319
 missions on a map that we can then 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.700
 follow any without doing any 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.140
 streak and nothing and then they say that with a flail 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.269
 35 can be achieved fashion 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.910
 then good we will have to try 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.989
 make a demos with the most I do not think that 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.580
 is the description of the gameplay that is 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.260
 quite old but good if you look 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.120
 for youtube and you have not seen it in the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.069
 stacks channel is I was commenting with him 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.630
 quite old gameplay the truth that 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.190
 it was when he was exposed he had a channel 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.120
 more or less of my size a little bit more 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.739
 big I think he was forty-something 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.630
 thousand subscribers the truth that they are 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.209
 very good times was more than a 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.359
 year the truth 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.650
 since then well with stacks and 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.610
 Well, keep talking about the game in 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.960
 yes really in this game I think that 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.449
 if you have good connection like me in this 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.099
 Well, yes, it shows much more 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.870
 that in the whites 2 is a tro point to 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.310
 please this game in the connection in my 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.599
 good opinion the game itself is not the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 connection but the game goes better 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.250
 because because in whites 2 they put you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.130
 a compensation of which the more 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.199
 You have me like you make you go 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.340
 worse is to say go further back to 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.470
 compensate with others who have worse 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 connection that you in the end if 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.620
 you have a very high pressure that many 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.539
 sometimes it hurts you so this game 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.880
 how good they have for me as I have 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.160
 good connection is that he killed quite 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.449
 easy and chose enough bullets then 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.949
 good is another point in favor that has 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.800
 this game that connection in my opinion 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.080
 is better than in the white 2 but 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.940
 as far as competitive to me this game 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 I like it less than white 2 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.380
 the game itself seems much easier 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.840
 by 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.730
 in the competitive one I mean or I am 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.460
 you remember the competitive not me but 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.400
 any total team is pretty 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.010
 leveled not because it was easy enough or 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.230
 be anyone could do any 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.490
 any perfect map the hacr was 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.140
 what's happening, of course, I do not know 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.550
 you can use hunter or anything like that so 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.410
 that is not how it calculates now it was a 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.580
 little more campera the game was not played 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.050
 more camper and also there was no point 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.000
 hot and none of that to me the point 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.340
 hot the way I like say 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.720
 that in the new game the ghost is not going 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.760
 to see but I think that it's just going to 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.050
 be with another name and good to me then 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.720
 really this game as you know there 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.800
 other ways that act the flag and 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.050
 well there you have the uap and look and 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.160
 destroy and without more I did not like 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.420
 too good I like the competitive 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.860
 but I like it a lot more than 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.840
 white two are games that my opinion 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.730
 they are quite different from me as I say 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.200
 personally I like whites more 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.730
 two that this one in short but this 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.930
 game is very fun too although 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.700
 well, other games seem better to me 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.900
 heat and you as you know old without 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.640
 more I hope you liked this 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.960
 example kids and you know that a 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.520
 from now all the impressions of 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.410
 this series is life so if you have 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.070
 liked it because I do not like favorites and 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.070
