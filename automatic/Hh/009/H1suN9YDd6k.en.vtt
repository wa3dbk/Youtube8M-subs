00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.710
 I explain how to say something else emerged 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.840
 whole face to make a complexion 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.340
 very fanti resca is perfect and then 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 Obviously los smoke with your fingers 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.129
 then I go to draw a concealer more 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.320
 clear of my skin tone on everything 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.699
 as the face to make bought canton 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:59.890
 very pale and then I go south to 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:01:01.269
 blend it with a fixed sponge the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.780
 all clearly with a powder 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.780
 transparent 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.530
 later with a mix of these two 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.750
 dark eyeshadows 1 brown one black opaque 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.789
 I go to do a lot contouring 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.240
 very accentuated to give just this 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.800
 this aspect very dug and dead to 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.800
 my opinion a little beautiful place 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.750
 handle 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.600
 with these two colors always opaque 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.320
 I will fight to emphasize 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.320
 instead the dark circles 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 I lay a base on my eyes and then 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 I use this mix of mister browns 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.160
 we are flesh-colored if you are brown for 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 realize the crease of the eye like a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.410
 normal tuxedo with a brush anymore 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.510
 note I use a dark brown map 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:28.240
 to make the external eye of the eye with 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 I go to illuminate an opaque cream color 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200
 the mobile eyelid and then liris smoke with 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.080
 brown for several months on an effect 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.730
 more natural and later I take 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.740
 same beautiful eyeliner that 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.300
 bacchus aspects is made two beautiful rigid 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.300
 fairly accentuated eyeliner 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.670
 I simply bent my eyelashes 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.660
 emitted of black mascara but if it goes away 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 free to false eyelashes 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 at this point they redefine the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.200
 eyebrows are a wax and then a 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.200
 arrest 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.530
 we come to the most succulent part of 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.870
 I don't use this mix of 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.660
 plum and brown to make veins 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.500
 classics of our beloved vampires of 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.500
 vampire diaries 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.250
 for the lips I am going to dampen mine 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.769
 natural color with any sector 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.260
 very clear, I always use a mix of 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.450
 brown plum color to make lips 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.250
 livid around and then I make an outline 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:18.470
 and very messy and I fill them too 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:22.370
 use a plum-colored pencil 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.440
 same plum pencil inside the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.210
 eyes and your makeup is completed 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.740
 guys I really hope so much 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.389
 that you enjoyed is a scam where 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.310
 lance actually and then it is not making you 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.750
 used to perfection I hope between 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.650
 suite liked to send you a big kiss 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.830
