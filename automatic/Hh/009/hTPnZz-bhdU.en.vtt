00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
which I like because then it becomes

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.080

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
actually for me it's very similar to the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.250 
actually for me it's very similar to the
olive<00:02:45.100> oil<00:02:45.280> version<00:02:45.790> except<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.930> actually
