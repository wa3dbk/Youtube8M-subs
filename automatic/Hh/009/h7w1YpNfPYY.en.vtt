00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 here we are event back on my channel 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.730
 new with call of duty advanced warfare 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.950
 today a very fast video more than anything else 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 in terms of time but very useful 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 intense in terms of utility because 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 as well remembered in the first video 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.539
 dedicated to creating classes either 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.279
 as for weapons both for what 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 it's about the character and what else if 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.490
 you missed it go see it 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.619
 I told you about the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 supplies practically during 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 multiplayer games are given to us 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.219
 of supplies on exceedance 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 certain challenges or during the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.570
 classic game we do something 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 important in these houses go to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 end up here inside the new objects 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.690
 once these boxes have been opened 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 supplies will give us 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.670
 objects both in terms of weapons if 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 intermediate objects for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.649
 customize our alter ego the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.870
 our virtual character 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.030
 soldier all this we unlock 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
 precisely at the end in the new objects for 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.769
 remind us what we unlocked but 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
 in operational terms they end up 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.340
 inside the arsenal 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.830
 as you see in the arsenal there are gods 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 slot and then gradually and eder yes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 they will go to fill up all that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 we have unlocked with these 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.540
 supplies and the very thing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.250
 this is interesting 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 this video precisely focused on 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 talk of how to level up 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.159
 quickly how to level in a manner 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 much faster than normal 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.329
 in addition to the classic start as you see 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.400
 in the weapons we unlock and go to 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.930
 ending up in the arsenal thanks to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.729
 supplies that we do not use 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.430
 we can exchange them for points 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 experience exchanging this object with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 experience points we can cancel or 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 we can even redeem it quite well 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.600
 a thousand points of experience what they have 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.720
 these weapons compared to normal have 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.549
 a different customization than 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.049
 to the classic weapon that has those 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.210
 features and nothing can 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.110
 change or you can only 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.329
 empower thanks to certain 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.159
 accessories instead these are both weapons 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.320
 details for and under the point of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.929
 aesthetic view but also under the point 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.209
 in view of the features though if 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.090
 not used I highly recommend you to 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.160
 exchange them 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.319
 I for example the sniper rifle is 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.700
 a weapon I rarely use 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.129
 so instead of going to ad 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 equip or keep it 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.300
 in the arsenal lava to be exchanged with ben 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 1000 experience points and continuing like this 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.440
 let's make another one we have 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.129
 another a use I go so to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 level 26 we see that we can 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.290
 use the kv type civil jersey is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.660
 I honestly ca n't use it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.819
 redeem for 500 because I am 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.099
 using all the term atlas also 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.569
 I can't do the Nigerian helmet 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.709
 use or rather I don't want it 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.630
 use the one I like most 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.329
 the dry canvas aesthetic that I was 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.610
 promoted level 26 without having done 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.680
 no game and having used the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.829
 supplies and exchanging them 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.299
 precisely with experience points then 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.280
 this was a really great video 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.870
 quick to show you how to level 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 faster than normal 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.150
 so not just multiplayer games 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.459
 but also going to sell then a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.319
 exchange weapons or accessories that we do not 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.180
 we will never use thanks to 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.620
 supplies with experience points 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.730
 I hope the video was yours 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.530
 liking 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.510
 and see you with so many new videos 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.510
 always here always on my channel
