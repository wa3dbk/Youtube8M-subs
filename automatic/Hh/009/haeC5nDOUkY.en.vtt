thought<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> would<00:00:18.510> maybe<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.930> fun<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> play

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
thought it would maybe be fun to play

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.010 
thought it would maybe be fun to play
free-for-all<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.279> use<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.060> RPG<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> lot<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
free-for-all and use the RPG a lot and I

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750 
free-for-all and use the RPG a lot and I
actually<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.859> starting<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
actually do really well starting off and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.000 
actually do really well starting off and
