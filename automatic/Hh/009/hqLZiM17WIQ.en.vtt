London<00:03:35.159> is<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.670> crucial<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.330> deviation

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
London is like crucial to deviation

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
London is like crucial to deviation
because<00:03:37.290> obviously<00:03:37.799> we've<00:03:38.190> got<00:03:38.220> parties

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.259 
is here and deviations by night like
it's<00:03:45.569> my<00:03:45.720> vision<00:03:46.190> what<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.370> say<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:47.879> it's

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
it's my vision what can I say like it's

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.240 
it's my vision what can I say like it's
corrected<00:03:48.690> by<00:03:48.870> me<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.319> I'm<00:03:49.650> corrected<00:03:50.129> by

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
corrected by me and I'm corrected by

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.819 
corrected by me and I'm corrected by
London<00:03:50.610> that's<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> best<00:03:51.720> way<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.870> say<00:03:52.170> it

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.140 

basically<00:03:58.829> any<00:03:59.069> good<00:03:59.280> club<00:03:59.519> night<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.910> me<00:04:00.030> is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
basically any good club night to me is

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.539 
basically any good club night to me is
about<00:04:00.359> trust<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.290> deviation<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:01.980> applies

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
about trust the deviation that applies

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.220 
about trust the deviation that applies
even<00:04:03.000> more<00:04:03.209> because<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.750> music<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.109> we

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
even more because the music that we

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.559 
even more because the music that we
booked<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.769> varied<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> concept<00:04:06.450> is

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
booked is so varied but the concept is

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.440 
booked is so varied but the concept is
is<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.150> and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
is that if I really like you know and

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.270 
is that if I really like you know and
respect<00:04:09.870> sir<00:04:10.079> music<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.739> appreciate<00:04:11.160> it

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
respect sir music and can appreciate it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.460 
respect sir music and can appreciate it
all<00:04:11.430> then<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.090> think<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.510> my<00:04:12.720> audience<00:04:13.109> can<00:04:13.200> as

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
all then I think that my audience can as

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.720 
all then I think that my audience can as
well<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.799> that's<00:04:13.920> why<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.190> come<00:04:14.400> so

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
well and that's why they come so

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.270 
well and that's why they come so
basically<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.780> concept<00:04:16.169> being<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
basically the concept being that you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.279 
basically the concept being that you
know<00:04:17.310> maybe<00:04:17.609> you're<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.820> house<00:04:18.000> head<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.630> you

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
know maybe you're a house head but you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.870 
know maybe you're a house head but you
never<00:04:19.560> really<00:04:19.769> listen<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.190> hip-hop<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.639> much

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
never really listen to hip-hop that much

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.240 
never really listen to hip-hop that much
well<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.359> love<00:04:21.539> both<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.169> we<00:04:22.470> play<00:04:22.680> both<00:04:22.889> as<00:04:23.130> long

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
as it has that particular sort of

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.810

years<00:04:50.550> time<00:04:54.980> most<00:04:55.980> notably<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.550> think<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
years time most notably I think the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.750 
years time most notably I think the
first<00:04:57.270> birthday<00:04:57.810> was<00:04:58.290> just<00:04:59.040> one<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.340> those<00:04:59.490> if

first birthday was just one of those if
you<00:04:59.940> were<00:05:00.060> there<00:05:00.240> moments<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.870> people<00:05:01.170> still

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
you were there moments that people still

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.600
