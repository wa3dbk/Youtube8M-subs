00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hi, I'm Betis and I do not have any controls 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.340
 bottle I say hello sorry for the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.340
 difference 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.030
 and you will say this aunt is an asshole 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.220
 because he said I want to change the greeting 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.380
 but notice that I'm not going to change it 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.529
 because I do not feel like it as well you know 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.830
 If you know me since I started, I'm 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.460
 a person that I comb my fucking mother or 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.590
 I am like a professional hairdresser and everything 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.440
 as you may have appreciated in many of 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 my videos my hairstyles are wonderful 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.180
 like this 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.090
 and good this one that I have and is also 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.100
 wonderful I know and how do I know that all 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.550
 you want hairstyles like me and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.790
 what it says in the scrambled hair diva I've 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.070
 decided to do a tutorial on how not to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.770
 ask like this to go outside 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.820
 Well, here is what the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.520
 first hairstyle would be the bun chocho is 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.470
 typical picked or casual that you wear 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
 to be at home 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.960
 the truth is that it is very comfortable but I 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.390
 I would go out on the street like this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.820
 if you are adventurous and you want to play it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.210
 who laugh at you can go out with him and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.909
 you will tell me how are you doing 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:44.470
 and I think it 's better 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.580
 how wonderful it is not me and you 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.580
 they look at the wonderful 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.799
 the second operator would be the friend of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.890
 cow you just put a pigtail 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.170
 high 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.170
 you to this the water over 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 and if you do not like how it looks with pigtail 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.770
 then you loose your ponytail and just 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.100
 you pour water what has been 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.770
 back and that is wonderful groomer 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.420
 with which you can raze the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.420
 nightclubs and things like that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.860
 do not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.239
 finally I will show you this hairstyle that 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.879
 it's wonderful is called the new 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.480
 raised bad hairs as I would say 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:44.350
 mother just i would take a nap 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.710
 of about 20 minutes I would get up and 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.030
 I would just leave the hair like that you know 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.380
 maybe I would allocate it a little more 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.200
 because if not the essence is lost but to 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.200
 times 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.810
 So, I think it has also 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.040
 reviewed 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.040
 and so 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.800
 I think it's worth you sure action you do 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.950
 with someone to improve those who also 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.720
 sense that after fear and people 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.720
 it disappears but good 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.280
 someone is left because he had 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.200
 and well, so I hope I have you 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.170
 liked this video yes that's a bit 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.600
 silly a bit like that and it does not last long but 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.790
 I had to record and I wanted to record and 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.110
 I did not know when to put the camera in 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.110
 in front of me and record 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.630
 the fact is that I was camping 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.730
 a week and that's why there will be no vine and the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.430
 last week but I wanted to win 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.220
 simply because he was tired already 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.110
 I did not feel like it and if you do not feel like it, you're not going 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.210
 to finish because if they did not ask him 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.490
 I put a shit in because it's like it's going 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.170
 to eat I hope to record some sooner 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.420
 and everything to say that I'm going on a trip 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.640
 but I'm going to grab a lot and when 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.300
 I come up today and everything and so 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.510
 good guys we do not have in the next 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.850
 video that I think prompt class and navigate 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.610
 leaf like favorites and all those things 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.650
 what the normal youtubers say and I 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.650
 I go from here I do not know why I speak so loud 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 ah
