very very bright and crystal like I

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.980 
very very bright and crystal like I
don't<00:01:20.980> know<00:01:21.490> what<00:01:21.700> I'm<00:01:21.820> talking<00:01:22.150> about<00:01:22.420> maybe

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
don't know what I'm talking about maybe

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.200 
don't know what I'm talking about maybe
I<00:01:23.140> should<00:01:23.320> just<00:01:23.350> shut<00:01:23.620> up<00:01:23.800> anyway<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:24.730> wait

I should just shut up anyway so wait

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.330 
I should just shut up anyway so wait
here<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.780> know<00:01:26.380> where<00:01:26.530> his<00:01:26.620> mask<00:01:26.890> went<00:01:27.220> but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
here I know where his mask went but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.590 
here I know where his mask went but
anyway<00:01:27.580> out<00:01:27.760> comes<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.090> Hound<00:01:28.270> doom<00:01:28.450> is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
anyway out comes the Hound doom is

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.210 
anyway out comes the Hound doom is
predicted<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.320> thought<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.040> was<00:01:30.159> gonna

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
predicted so I thought that it was gonna

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.130 
predicted so I thought that it was gonna
go<00:01:30.430> first<00:01:30.729> like<00:01:31.360> I<00:01:31.390> thought<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.840> was<00:01:31.960> going<00:01:32.080> to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
go first like I thought it was going to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.200 
go first like I thought it was going to
be<00:01:32.260> faster<00:01:32.620> than<00:01:32.650> Rotom<00:01:33.100> because<00:01:33.490> her<00:01:34.000> times

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
be faster than Rotom because her times

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.230 
be faster than Rotom because her times
fast<00:01:34.540> but<00:01:34.870> it's<00:01:35.020> not<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.470> fast<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.970> anyway<00:01:37.210> I

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
fast but it's not that fast so anyway I

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.610 
fast but it's not that fast so anyway I
was<00:01:37.390> thinking<00:01:37.420> about<00:01:37.630> protecting<00:01:38.320> because<00:01:38.530> I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
was thinking about protecting because I

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.710 
was thinking about protecting because I
knew<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:38.920> were<00:01:38.950> probably<00:01:39.220> probably<00:01:39.940> went<00:01:40.690> to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
knew we were probably probably went to

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.980 
knew we were probably probably went to
attack<00:01:41.110> road<00:01:41.380> um<00:01:41.560> because<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:43.000> know<00:01:43.030> it

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
attack road um because it's you know it

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.900 
attack road um because it's you know it
can<00:01:44.380> do<00:01:44.500> more<00:01:44.680> damage<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.400> case<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:45.760> a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
can do more damage in case you have a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.900 
can do more damage in case you have a
pory<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.420> or<00:01:46.720> crobat<00:01:47.260> but<00:01:47.950> anyway<00:01:48.280> I'm<00:01:48.790> gonna

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
send out a Vaporeon so I'm like thunder

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.869 
send out a Vaporeon so I'm like thunder
no<00:02:47.840> froslass<00:02:48.840> here<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.290> amazing<00:02:49.829> because<00:02:50.730> it

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
no froslass here is amazing because it

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.849 
no froslass here is amazing because it
has<00:02:51.060> weather<00:02:51.329> ball<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.349> allows<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.829> to

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
has weather ball and that allows it to

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.949 
has weather ball and that allows it to
kill<00:02:53.159> fire<00:02:53.459> types<00:02:53.849> like<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.390> send<00:02:54.599> out<00:02:54.689> a<00:02:54.719> fire

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
kill fire types like you send out a fire

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.630 
kill fire types like you send out a fire
type<00:02:55.200> thing<00:02:55.439> and<00:02:55.469> oh<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.859> gonna<00:02:56.010> kill<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.489> cuz

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
type thing and oh I'm gonna kill you cuz

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.420 
type thing and oh I'm gonna kill you cuz
you<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.790> nice<00:02:56.969> type<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.900> whether<00:02:58.230> ball<00:02:58.500> anyway

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you a nice type know whether ball anyway

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.399 
you a nice type know whether ball anyway
so<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.849> hundred<00:03:00.150> based<00:03:00.480> power<00:03:00.750> within<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
so it's a hundred based power within the

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.839 
so it's a hundred based power within the
rain<00:03:01.590> water<00:03:02.340> type<00:03:02.609> move<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:04.260> gets<00:03:04.439> the

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
rain water type move and it gets the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.309 
rain water type move and it gets the
power<00:03:05.849> boost<00:03:06.239> from<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.629> rain<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:06.930> well<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.290> I

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
power boost from the rain as well so I

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.140 
power boost from the rain as well so I
thought<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.799> would<00:03:07.889> be<00:03:07.980> more<00:03:08.159> damage<00:03:08.939> than

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
thought it would be more damage than

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.030 
thought it would be more damage than
shadowboxer<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:09.989> went<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.379> it<00:03:10.409> anyway<00:03:10.799> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
shadowboxer just went for it anyway and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.729 
shadowboxer just went for it anyway and
of<00:03:11.969> course<00:03:12.000> Rotom<00:03:12.810> uses<00:03:13.079> Thunder<00:03:13.439> I<00:03:13.469> mean

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
of course Rotom uses Thunder I mean

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.099 
of course Rotom uses Thunder I mean
that's<00:03:14.370> what<00:03:14.549> Rotom<00:03:14.909> does<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.959> way

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
that's what Rotom does so in a way

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.470 
that's what Rotom does so in a way
there's<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.950> weather<00:03:17.459> ball<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.120> doesn't

there's a weather ball and it doesn't

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.759 
there's a weather ball and it doesn't
