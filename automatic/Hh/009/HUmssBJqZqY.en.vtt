great and you know 28 matches in a row
and<00:01:59.850> grand<00:02:00.450> slams<00:02:01.130> might<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.520> ever<00:02:02.670> happen

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and grand slams might not ever happen

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
and grand slams might not ever happen
again<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.820> now<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.990> feel<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.560> did<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.829> all

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
again so now we feel like we did it all

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.559

we can do and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.040 
we can do and
probably<00:02:11.569> never<00:02:11.660> going<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.019> another

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050
