00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
what I did with the potatoes is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.870 
what I did with the potatoes is
yesterday<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.569> sliced<00:01:32.959> them<00:01:33.259> on<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.310> mandolin

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
yesterday we sliced them on a mandolin

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.149 
yesterday we sliced them on a mandolin
about<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.619> millimeter<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.709> two<00:01:36.950> millimeters

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
about a millimeter to two millimeters

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.199 
about a millimeter to two millimeters
thick<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:39.020> they<00:01:39.439> sat<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.179> a

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
thick and then they sat in this is a

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.359 
thick and then they sat in this is a
salt<00:01:41.569> water<00:01:41.629> solution<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.590> need<00:01:42.739> to<00:01:42.950> get<00:01:43.189> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
salt water solution you need to get the

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.249 
salt water solution you need to get the
water<00:01:43.610> out<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.179> potato<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:44.959> should

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
water out of the potato so you should

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.260 
water out of the potato so you should
prepare<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.009> potatoes<00:01:46.429> up<00:01:46.459> to<00:01:46.729> eight<00:01:46.879> hours

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
prepare the potatoes up to eight hours

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.419 
prepare the potatoes up to eight hours
at<00:01:47.810> least<00:01:47.899> eight<00:01:48.289> hours<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:48.739> should<00:01:48.799> say<00:01:49.069> at

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
at least eight hours I should say at

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.589 
at least eight hours I should say at
least<00:01:49.579> eight<00:01:49.819> hours<00:01:50.090> before<00:01:50.270> you're<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.539> to

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599 
least eight hours before you're going to

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.300 
least eight hours before you're going to
use<00:01:50.810> them<00:01:51.049> if<00:01:51.349> you<00:01:51.530> try<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.770> do<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.099> the<00:01:52.189> last

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
use them if you try to do it at the last

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.859 
use them if you try to do it at the last
minute<00:01:52.520> there<00:01:52.759> will<00:01:52.909> still<00:01:53.119> be<00:01:53.179> water<00:01:53.509> in<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
minute there will still be water in the

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.899 
minute there will still be water in the
potatoes<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.950> way<00:01:55.129> the<00:01:55.280> potatoes<00:01:55.700> baked

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
potatoes and this way the potatoes baked

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.690 
potatoes and this way the potatoes baked
they<00:01:56.119> become<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.629> crunchy<00:01:57.379> and<00:01:57.590> sweet<00:01:58.219> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
they become really crunchy and sweet and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.819 
they become really crunchy and sweet and
there's<00:01:59.209> just<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.569> not<00:01:59.869> any<00:02:00.110> water<00:02:00.379> left<00:02:00.619> in

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
there's just like not any water left in

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.410 
there's just like not any water left in
them<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.810> 800<00:02:03.109> grams<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.679> potatoes<00:02:07.119> 150<00:02:08.119> grams

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
them so 800 grams of potatoes 150 grams

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
them so 800 grams of potatoes 150 grams
of<00:02:08.720> chopped<00:02:09.170> onion<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> nice<00:02:12.200> amount<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.680> olive

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
of chopped onion so nice amount of olive

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:27.480 
of chopped onion so nice amount of olive
oil<00:02:13.069> just<00:02:16.630> by<00:02:17.630> eye<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:19.870> then<00:02:20.870> some<00:02:21.349> rosemary

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.990 

and<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.270> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.480> spread<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000

and then I'm going to spread the
potatoes<00:02:31.180> over<00:02:31.930> top<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> dough<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.890> first

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
potatoes over top of the dough the first

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.570 
potatoes over top of the dough the first
thing<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.400> should<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:50.650> that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
thing you should know is that is that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.030 
thing you should know is that is that
when<00:02:51.940> you're<00:02:52.060> baking<00:02:52.210> pizza<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:53.710> need<00:02:53.920> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
when you're baking pizza you need to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.880 
when you're baking pizza you need to
bake<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.430> at<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:54.910> hot<00:02:55.180> temperature<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
bake it at a really hot temperature and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.650 
bake it at a really hot temperature and
it's<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.340> hot<00:02:57.550> temperature<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.270> causes

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it's that hot temperature that causes

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.200
