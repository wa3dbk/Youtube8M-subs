00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 We are going to learn how to make relief 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 So far we have been working 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.150
 point so low that we still milestone plan and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.930
 Now let's learn to work with the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.550
 relief point is left with these lines 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.550
 well doing these waves 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.540
 to work in highlight point no 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.790
 we will click here as if we were doing 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.870
 normal low point but we will click 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.830
 up here catching the thread from behind 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.830
 of the braid 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.150
 we take the tape we take the vaga 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 and close 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.950
 as if it were a normal low 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 we will do others instead of clicking here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.790
 click above 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.500
 in the middle of the braid catching 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.500
 only the strand behind 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.050
 let's go the tape we have two vague 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 we closed both at the same time as if 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.840
 will try a normal low 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.890
 we will do it again we already take out the aforementioned 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890
 the two 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.180
 we puncture in the middle of the braid we take 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.870
 tape 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.870
 the two 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.370
 we puncture in the middle of the braid we take 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370
 tape
