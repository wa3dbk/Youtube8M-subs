alright now that looks pretty messy

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.170 
alright now that looks pretty messy
I<00:02:46.010> agree<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:47.350> once<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.680> it

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
I agree but once we get it

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.760 
I agree but once we get it
snugged<00:02:50.180> up<00:02:51.040> it'll<00:02:52.040> look<00:02:52.160> swell<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:54.320> this<00:02:54.590> is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
snugged up it'll look swell and this is

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.670 
snugged up it'll look swell and this is
a<00:02:54.800> slow<00:02:55.670> process<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:57.050> don't<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.410> want<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
a slow process you don't just want to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.710 
a slow process you don't just want to
yank<00:02:57.950> these<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.220> do<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.210> just

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
what I have I just tighten it up a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.030 
what I have I just tighten it up a
little<00:03:08.120> bit<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:10.940> from<00:03:11.150> there<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:12.040> just

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
little bit and then from there I just

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.530 
little bit and then from there I just
grab<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.610> court<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:15.350> feed<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.680> through<00:03:15.830> I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
feed a fair bit of it through because I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.510 
feed a fair bit of it through because I
don't<00:03:19.280> want<00:03:19.780> too<00:03:20.780> much<00:03:20.960> slack<00:03:21.440> at<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.370> end<00:03:22.460> of

my monkey's fist there and then I just
follow<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:27.080> follow<00:03:27.290> what<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.650> fed

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
through until it comes out the other end

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.010 
through until it comes out the other end
and<00:03:34.910> I'm<00:03:35.000> gonna<00:03:35.120> do<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.420> same<00:03:35.600> with<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.870> other

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.190 

follow<00:03:43.160> it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400 

continue<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.160> follow<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:49.020> pull<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.140> up<00:03:50.230> and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
continue to follow it pull it up and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.220 
continue to follow it pull it up and
through<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:52.450> you'll<00:03:52.629> see<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:52.930> got<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.080> little

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
through now you'll see we got a little

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.540 
through now you'll see we got a little
bit<00:03:53.440> smaller<00:03:53.590> there<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:58.050> little<00:03:59.050> bit<00:03:59.230> smaller

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
bit smaller there a little bit smaller

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.610 
bit smaller there a little bit smaller
and<00:04:00.550> I'm<00:04:00.700> going<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.910> do<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.510> couple<00:04:02.110> more

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
and I'm going to do that a couple more

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.759 
and I'm going to do that a couple more
times<00:04:03.239> until<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:05.080> size<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.650> I

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
times until I have that the size that I

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.150 
times until I have that the size that I
want<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:07.230> in<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.349> position<00:04:08.800> that<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:09.010> want

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
want it and in the position that I want

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.580 
want it and in the position that I want
it

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:24.460 
it
so<00:04:11.590> again<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.190> follow<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.030> court

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.090 

and<00:04:24.800> sometimes<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.490> hard<00:04:25.670> to<00:04:25.700> keep<00:04:25.910> track<00:04:26.240> of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
and sometimes it's hard to keep track of

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.650 
and sometimes it's hard to keep track of
where<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.250> cord<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.640> going<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.660> nonetheless

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
where the cord is going but nonetheless

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:51.980 
where the cord is going but nonetheless
you'll<00:04:33.350> get

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.659 

okay<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.500> we've<00:04:52.710> got<00:04:52.860> some<00:04:53.069> more<00:04:53.190> out<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
okay so we've got some more out of it

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.550 
okay so we've got some more out of it
let's<00:04:54.300> see<00:04:54.449> it's<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.660> pretty<00:04:54.810> decent<00:04:55.259> size

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
let's see it's a pretty decent size

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.240 
let's see it's a pretty decent size
there<00:04:56.039> but<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:56.340> not<00:04:56.430> quite<00:04:56.580> yet<00:04:57.240> even<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:59.190> I'm

there but it's not quite yet even so I'm
going<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.400> go<00:04:59.520> through<00:04:59.819> once<00:05:00.210> more<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:02.669> try<00:05:03.060> to

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
going to go through once more and try to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:23.779 
going to go through once more and try to
even<00:05:03.599> everything<00:05:03.990> up

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.200

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210
