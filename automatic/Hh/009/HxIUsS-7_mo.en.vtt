00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.250
 good morning several new video this is 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.309
 a video tutorial but not on make up but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.019
 on a fairly simple hairstyle 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.660
 it's not too complicated I'm in 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 silvia company you've already seen 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.460
 cristina salice girls is a new 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 entry is she who will make it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 the silvia hairstyle we have chosen 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 silvia precisely because the place a hair 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 exact long enough even and therefore 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.859
 a hairstyle that comes well on 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.780
 this kind of hair we took 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.670
 as a reference point serena van der 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 goot in the picture and of vast previews 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.430
 also good is a braid like a spike or 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.039
 fish bone is called both 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.530
 ways it is quite simple to do though 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 better if he had another person do 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 because alone it becomes a little bit more 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.980
 complicated but feasible even by yourself 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 it is not exact another nice thing that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 we wanted we didn't do it in the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.670
 tutorial because we are here in the mountains a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 goal of bulls unless we are very provided 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 then a house a little improvised 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.680
 it would be nice maybe while you make 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.729
 the braid insert a colored thread 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.710
 what dyes 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.200
 of course you can also use it at the end 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.990
 maybe even to close ag restaurant 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.119
 pleasant at home a little more colorful on 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.250
 veil on dark hair maybe you notice 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.710
 also exact as in your case 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.700
 so we leave you some photos 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.130
 we hope to see the hairstyle 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.009
 all good we put in a lifetime ago 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 from this video and then leave you at 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.979
 tutorial and we salute you 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.979
 Hello Hello hello 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's start with the tutorial then step la 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.010
 cristina word then hi girls today 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.320
 Let's start making a braid explain 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.420
 let's start by making a nice high tail a 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.610
 soft on top so after we can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 bloat comes the hair 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.840
 we chose this elastic a little 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.240
 jewel you can put what 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.760
 you want if you make it also a day 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.250
 simple elastic or something a little 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.130
 cute particular then made me 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 tells we see a beautiful brushed 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.970
 so we can work better if 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.170
 you have beautiful long hair and paris vi 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.790
 a braid will surely come 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.370
 then we divided our beauty 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.250
 tail in two equal parts 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:58.220
 take a ciocchetti na external like this 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.030
 we cross it on the first part of the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.380
 queue and join it to the second queue e 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.060
 let's go on like this 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.280
 we always try to take the strands 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.610
 equal so it will all be the same e 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.430
 the important thing when we cross it pull 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.430
 well, let's move on 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.060
 and a youtuber the art 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.070
 already 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.060
 shoot him well withdrawn 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.340
 or good is good and we also ask a 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.340
 silvia the delicate delicate hand 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.129
 if you see that cristina on the arm 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.689
 I'll put you in the info box link to 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.700
 facebook page of the girl who 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.700
 realizes they are really very nice 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.000
 then important that to make it come 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.500
 well take enough strands 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.080
 as big as you are, beautiful cicciotti 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.450
 aqua the pineapples and take small fairies 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.750
 even more fatigue and perhaps makes little 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.750
 the idea 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.459
 or if you want to say something colors and the 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.519
 cellars we are coming to the end 

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:28.269
 you can decide to leave a little 

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:30.939
 como d'andretta especially if you have not 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:37.239
 the scaled hair indeed fatigue 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:40.599
 cross ok for example we could 

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:43.629
 close it here and leave this thing 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:48.249
 how to proceed we come to be close 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:51.009
 for the sake of this elastic appeal 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.099
 simple black yes that approaches us uses 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.629
 we used the jewel we dig a 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.849
 bit with the style but then 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:00.639
 you have one of those thin thin ones yet 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.889
 they obviously also depend on the color 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.039
 of your hair to the exact sought 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.469
 what they have higher up almost not 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:11.679
 yes , we fix it a little bit 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.029
 loaded tenant who with some 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:16.959
 cover 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:19.869
 ok we learn a comb like this 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:22.240
 with the tip that is what there is 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:26.529
 interested we slip the square of the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.670
 comb under the hair like this and pull 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:33.480
 slightly 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.480
 not to be too bombastic 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:41.050
 so then if you make it too tight 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.530
 you can't do this, there isn't one 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.400
 talked about a soft glue roll a 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.690
 little on so it remains less squashed 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.790
 below if you have hair that 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.380
 they shoot put a hairpin but not me 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.540
 they did us and this is the braid 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.390
 now let's put a little dh so we fix 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.880
 this hair coming out a little yes 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:09.300
 a sprinkle tighten so ok then a 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.400
 another piece of advice we want to give you is 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.380
 you can close the braid with yours 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.960
 hair 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.410
 we tied to signa with a little more 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.780
 high 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.330
 so we have a little more hair 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.010
 long underneath with those very elastic 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.620
 thin because this is a bit big 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.690
 that book will be the closure of the glue 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:33.370
 take a bunch of yours 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.920
 hair rolled around 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:40.390
 to the elastic so as to cover it then 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.000
 you can fix it with a hairpin maybe 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.650
 below so you can't see one 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.530
 little wife of those little ones 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.800
 small but yes well nine right happens 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:54.670
 because the elastic is too big and there 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.230
 remains a cute covered elastic band arrives 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.750
 so above we have the jewel below 

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.260
 instead it seems that we have nothing 

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.100
 cute v 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.680
 ok so this final result e 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:09.310
 we hope you enjoyed this 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:13.500
 tutorial on a hairstyle and there 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.500
 see you at the next video bye bye
