00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello everyone back to the magic of 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.120
 beard 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.230
 today we go to the cinema together with 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.960
 very bad me and his beautiful 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.330
 minion to make these cupcakes there 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.550
 need two basic and cut cupcakes e 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.580
 covered with sugar paste 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.340
 yellow 2 round pastry rings one 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.590
 slightly smaller than the other of the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.560
 food grade glue that we can replace 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.170
 with boiled water and let cool 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.150
 of solvent for food colors that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.740
 we can replace with vodka or in 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.160
 any other in the transparent heart 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.650
 some silver food coloring a little 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.320
 of white brown black sugar paste 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.320
 a pair of toothpicks that are always 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.050
 very useful a black food marker 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.870
 and a rolling pin besides obviously a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.410
 some brushes knives and things of 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.780
 this kind to start 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.030
 let our cupcakes rest e 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.590
 let 's take the white sugar paste 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.170
 after pulling the dough has one 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.789
 uniform thickness with ours 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.469
 largest pastry rings 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.329
 we cut well 3 circles and always 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.189
 important that when we cut we press 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.530
 well then let's turn the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.069
 coppapasta in order to have a circle 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.369
 defined now we make three more 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.630
 equal in order to have a total of 6 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.999
 circles that we will need for 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 both cupcakes like when we cut 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:34.569
 with the pastry cutter there may be some 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.819
 trimmings like these let's spin 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.540
 between the fingers without forming it a 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.880
 appetizer 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.160
 are not smooth when made our 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.020
 circle we take three and I stand 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.640
 using a tip for ices 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 let's focus on why we're doing it 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600
 the bordeaux of the glasses for each year 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.740
 always turning so as to 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.870
 get more in circle inside 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.420
 of the other we detach once 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.500
 prepared our three and rings of ma 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 if between the circles we leave them 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.690
 dry well and at least I don't know one 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.700
 quarter of an hour after which rewarding a little 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.860
 of coloring dye men in 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.150
 dust that come together better we see 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.320
 a little bit of powder in 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.010
 a small bowl we add a little 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.080
 million solvent per dye 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.090
 food with a little bit of vodka or 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.070
 grappa we do not mix well anyway 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.840
 best to come benign forms of 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.640
 of the volumes forms that slowly 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.350
 trying not to brush up again 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.450
 twice in the same place for not 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.250
 to form streaks we go to paint 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.959
 then our little ring when everything is 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.310
 very dry we take our coffees 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.750
 that we put a little bit of glue 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.270
 food in the places where we want 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.920
 position the eyes which 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.769
 food you can, there are excellent ones 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 on the market and that you can take 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.550
 widely you can do a lot 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.140
 simple at home by mixing a few 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.260
 teaspoon icing sugar with 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 enough water to make it from wood 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.330
 fluid we put our eyes in 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.330
 desired position 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.090
 after that we go to try the pupils 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.799
 our minion year the useful brown with 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.719
 inside puppets we make two 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.760
 circles for the irises I'm using 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.230
 this to have the same 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.640
 size but we can easily 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.439
 also do the hand so much then 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.540
 we press with our fingers to flatten and 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.579
 we crush this I liked that he had 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.409
 eyes turned inward 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.340
 take the black food marker 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.840
 and let's do two shots for the pupils 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.030
 always a little cross-eyed that I like it 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.620
 at this point we can go to assemble 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.730
 the ring of glasses to do it 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.120
 let's take some more glue 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.590
 we feed it on the edge 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.500
 we take one of our circles that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.329
 we had defined before we turn it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.090
 put some food glue in the 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.849
 unpainted part then trying to 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.150
 touch the part as little as possible 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.770
 colored so as not to leave fingerprints on it 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050
 fix 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.880
 at this point let's move on to make a mouth 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.650
 to this we make an expression a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 a little surprised so let's do one 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.250
 oval mouth always with the paste of 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.230
 we are going to make black sugar 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.180
 hair strips then 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.720
 we rest on our heads like this and fear 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.230
 well what a way to do schettino recall 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.090
 with another if we can't attack him 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.110
 which can happen because it is just 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.760
 done early 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.860
 today we are already with a brush with one 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 at this point there is only one toothpick 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.670
 elastic of the goggles we take a 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.350
 bit of black sugar paste well 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.570
 soft we pull it with our own 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.810
 rolling pin and we cut it with a knife 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.300
 making a strip in tina we always say 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.270
 with your fingers at the edges so you have 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.250
 a more precise line if we want to keep 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.140
 We are pleased with the perfect edges 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.940
 buy game design equipment 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.800
 there are also specific tools 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.160
 to make the strips I can adjust the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.640
 distance between the two blades more strip 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.830
 wide this means the wheel is called 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.880
 however, we generally do pastry cutting 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.230
 we made it by hand and it is 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.420
 the same came very well 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.130
 let's take our elastic envy 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.140
 lightly with glue and tips where 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.230
 we want to put it 8 position 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.090
 pressing it well 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.430
 of the glasses that we bring down on 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.200
 side of the cup cake so that it gives one 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.390
 greater idea of three-dimensionality then 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.380
 with the knife we ​​cut we expect 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.380
 then on the other side 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.970
 I'm using some glue because today 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.300
 in the studio environment and dry but 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.970
 everything always depends on what environment there is 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.860
 and at this point we have ready that the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.150
 our 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.700
 of course then we can play with 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.800
 the expression we can make it equal with 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.710
 one eye or we can 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.330
 modify the expression by making it a 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.950
 smile instead open mouth with 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.740
 play with hair by putting it on 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.750
 example 4 in a row instead of the tuft 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.310
 watching you a little film is always a 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.050
 pleasure with a little imagination you can 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.940
 finally make the expressions you will do 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.770
 definitely crazy kids but also 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.630
 a little big with our minions 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.670
 we finished I recommend you continue 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.500
 to follow my web channel the magic of 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.270
 barbarous to see so many other things 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.300
 delicious to do with pasta di 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.300
 sugar
