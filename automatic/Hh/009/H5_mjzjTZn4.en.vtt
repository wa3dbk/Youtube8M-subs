00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
 Hello everyone 

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.600
 Welcome to this week's video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.640
 Today I am going to introduce how to increase engine horsepower. 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.120
 How to make your car run faster 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.560
 When you add or modify some devices on the car to increase horsepower to improve the acceleration performance of the car. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.860
 Here are some things you need to consider and do about the engine 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.400
 There are some places where your engine needs to be modified. 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.980
 When the throttle is fully open, your engine will consume a certain amount of fuel. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 Now, in order to produce more horsepower 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.600
 Just burn more fuel. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.640
 Therefore, some modified devices will make your car burn more fuel to increase horsepower. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.520
 In order to burn more fuel, the engine will consume more oxygen. 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.840
 So, when you start the oil and gas mixer, these devices will increase the amount of air intake. 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.800
 Or directly inject oxygen or other mixture to provide more oxygen to the combustion chamber. 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.420
 Therefore, by increasing the amount of intake air or oxygen into the combustion chamber 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.820
 The engine can burn more oxygen 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 Thus, the engine can provide more horsepower 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.460
 Because the combustion chamber will generate more pressure to push the piston down. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.220
 Thereby causing the crankshaft to generate more torque 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.820
 Then another way to increase horsepower is 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 Increase engine efficiency 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.300
 Your engine efficiency has improved 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.400
 Less wasted energy 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.360
 Less energy is wasted, and the energy gained is increased. 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 So, in order to achieve this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420
 You can increase the compression ratio 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 If you increase the compression ratio of the engine 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.640
 Your engine is naturally more efficient 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.300
 Thus the horsepower of the engine will be higher than when the compression ratio is low. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 same 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.220
 You can reduce frictional resistance 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 All relative movements on the engine produce friction 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.900
 If you can reduce this friction 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.420
 There will be less heat between them 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 So your engine efficiency will increase 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.820
 This engine will provide more useful power 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.380
 Another way to increase engine horsepower is 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.500
 If you can increase the engine speed by any means 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.860
 If you can increase the number of combustions in the combustion chamber in the same period of time 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.460
 For example, from 50 times per minute to 100 times per minute. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 This will directly increase the horsepower of the engine if all other conditions are the same. 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 If you have seen my previous video about horsepower vs. torque 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.420
 You will know that basically horsepower is equal to the speed divided by 5252 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560
 So if the speed increases 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.520
 Your horsepower will naturally improve. 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.040
 Double the speed to double the horsepower when all other conditions are the same 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.160
 The last way to increase engine horsepower is 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.440
 Reduce inertia resistance 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.860
 For example, everyone looks at this piston. 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.580
 This piston is of quality 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.600
 Some power is consumed in the acceleration movement of the piston itself. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.300
 If you can reduce the quality of the piston 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.380
 The piston consumes less energy to overcome inertia during acceleration from bottom dead center to top dead center. 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.440
 Less energy is consumed on the piston 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120
 The more energy is used to propel the car 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.180
 Another aspect is rotational inertia 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 When the vehicle accelerates, all the rotating parts will be accelerated 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.820
 Such as drive shafts, gearboxes, wheels, differentials, etc. 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.720
 I will talk a little more about this. 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.880
 But basically, this is another way to increase horsepower. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 What you need to remember is 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.060
 In order to increase the acceleration performance of the vehicle 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.800
 Engine horsepower is not the only factor 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.900
 If you slam on the throttle 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120
 Your tires will slip immediately 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 No matter how much horsepower the engine provides 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 Not being accelerated in the application 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.100
 If you want all the horsepower of the engine to be applied to the acceleration 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.180
 You can increase the grip of the tires to make the engine power fully applied. 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.540
 How to achieve it? 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540
 You can increase the viscosity of the tire 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 This can change the coefficient of friction 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.300
 Everyone sees this formula 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:25.680
 The friction that pushes the tire forward is equal to the friction coefficient of the tire and the road surface multiplied by the pressure on the tire. 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.520
 So you can increase the friction coefficient by increasing the viscosity of the tire. 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.840
 Can also increase the pressure on the tire 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.180
 But increasing tire pressure by increasing vehicle quality is not a good way 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.280
 Because it means your car is heavier 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 Force equals mass multiplied by acceleration 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.500
 If you increase the weight of the car 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.100
 Then the acceleration will become smaller 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.480
 This is not in line with our original intention 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.200
 So the most appropriate way is 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.640
 Best to change the coefficient of friction 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.220
 Or use aerodynamic accessories to increase the weight of the car 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:13.600
 I don't have a very detailed look at which different tools you can use to increase the horsepower. 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:23.020
 But these device tools and so on are designed to meet the methods I listed above to increase horsepower to improve vehicle speed performance.
