00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
into production but certainly what you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
into production but certainly what you
can<00:01:33.869> expect<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.470> probably<00:01:34.710> what's<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:34.979> line

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
can expect is probably what's in line

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
can expect is probably what's in line
