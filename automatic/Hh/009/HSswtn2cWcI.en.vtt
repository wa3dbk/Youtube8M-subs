00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.150 
I try and of course this was only like I
think<00:02:15.250> 1/8<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.910> price<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:17.410> $20<00:02:18.040> or

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
think 1/8 of the price like $20 or

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.070 
think 1/8 of the price like $20 or
something<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.240> when<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.660> first

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
something like that but so when I first

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.440 
something like that but so when I first
got<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.530> job<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.130> was<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:22.270> really

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
got this job but it was really really

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.280 
got this job but it was really really
good<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:24.160> Jersey<00:02:24.670> was<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.060> soft<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.050> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
good like how Jersey was so soft and I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.080 
good like how Jersey was so soft and I
thought<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.830> hey<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.550> pretty<00:02:27.820> good

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
thought like hey this is a pretty good

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.780 
thought like hey this is a pretty good
deal<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.590> after<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.280> couple<00:02:30.520> of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
deal and but after like a couple of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.850 
deal and but after like a couple of
washes<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:34.090> softness<00:02:34.570> has<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.080> gone<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
washes the softness has now gone and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.960 
washes the softness has now gone and
it's<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> regular<00:02:38.280> rare<00:02:39.280> regular

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's just like a regular rare regular

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.570 
it's just like a regular rare regular
sweater<00:02:40.300> now<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.590> wouldn't<00:02:41.950> say<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.310> great

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
sweater now so I wouldn't say it's great

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.190 
sweater now so I wouldn't say it's great
but<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.270> $20<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.230> guess<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.810> next<00:02:47.110> place

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
but for $20 I guess it is the next place

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.530 
but for $20 I guess it is the next place
I<00:02:47.410> went<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.769> look<00:02:47.860> for<00:02:47.920> Duke<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.519> at<00:02:48.760> 5<00:02:48.970> or<00:02:49.030> 21

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
I went to look for Duke is at 5 or 21

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.229 
I went to look for Duke is at 5 or 21
and<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.350> didn't<00:02:51.010> specifically<00:02:51.580> go<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.850> forever

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
and I didn't specifically go to forever

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.140 
and I didn't specifically go to forever
21<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.959> get<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.950> saw<00:02:54.340> these<00:02:54.580> jumpers

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
21 to get to but I saw these jumpers

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.960 
21 to get to but I saw these jumpers
there<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:56.410> think<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:57.070> was<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> few<00:02:57.489> months<00:02:57.730> ago<00:02:57.820> I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
there I think it was a few months ago I

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.460 
there I think it was a few months ago I
mean<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.690> don't<00:02:58.810> think<00:02:59.050> they<00:02:59.320> have

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
mean right now I don't think they have

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.949 
mean right now I don't think they have
any<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.739> these<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.220> store<00:03:00.610> anymore<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:01.660> they

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
any of these in store anymore but they

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.270 
any of these in store anymore but they
just<00:03:02.200> look<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.980> they've<00:03:03.100> got

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
just look like this and they've got

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.699 
just look like this and they've got
coats<00:03:03.580> on<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> white<00:03:05.260> one<00:03:05.500> and

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
coats on it and this is a white one and

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.830 
coats on it and this is a white one and
it<00:03:06.160> says<00:03:06.400> good<00:03:06.760> things<00:03:07.060> come<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.480> those<00:03:07.660> who

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
it says good things come to those who

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.310 
it says good things come to those who
wait<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.390> material<00:03:10.390> that's<00:03:10.690> made<00:03:10.900> from<00:03:11.080> it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
wait and material that's made from it's

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.090 
wait and material that's made from it's
exactly<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.950> same<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.959> amount<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.799> spandex

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
exactly the same like amount of spandex

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.440 
exactly the same like amount of spandex
and<00:03:15.730> rayon<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.380> wall<00:03:17.590> fox<00:03:17.860> one<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.239> a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
and rayon as the wall fox one so it is a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.530 
and rayon as the wall fox one so it is a
very<00:03:19.810> good<00:03:19.989> tube<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.350> terms<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.860> material<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
very good tube in terms of material it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.870 
very good tube in terms of material it
also<00:03:22.750> has<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> soft<00:03:23.739> bounce<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.700> would

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
also has a soft bounce to it but I would

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.020 
also has a soft bounce to it but I would
say<00:03:25.060> overall<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.600> wild<00:03:25.840> fox<00:03:26.079> one<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:27.030> still

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
say overall the wild fox one it is still

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.069 
say overall the wild fox one it is still
better<00:03:28.239> quality<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.910> cuts<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.049> a

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
better quality and this cuts this is a

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.170 
better quality and this cuts this is a
size<00:03:32.739> large<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.989> definitely<00:03:35.910> not<00:03:36.910> as

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
size large so it's definitely not as

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.740 
size large so it's definitely not as
oversized<00:03:37.900> as<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.500> raw<00:03:38.680> fox<00:03:39.010> one<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.299> terms<00:03:40.600> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
oversized as the raw fox one in terms of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.140 
oversized as the raw fox one in terms of
sizing<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.380> got<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> size<00:03:41.950> logic<00:03:42.459> purposely

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
sizing so I got the size logic purposely

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.850 
sizing so I got the size logic purposely
so<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.900> would<00:03:44.049> look<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.320> little<00:03:44.470> bit<00:03:44.680> more

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
so that it would look a little bit more

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.780 
so that it would look a little bit more
like<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> oversized<00:03:45.640> wild<00:03:46.090> Fox<00:03:46.299> specter<00:03:47.790> yeah

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
like the oversized wild Fox specter yeah

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.970 
like the oversized wild Fox specter yeah
so<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.810> pretty<00:03:49.989> good<00:03:50.200> I've<00:03:50.470> watched<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:50.920> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
so it's pretty good I've watched this a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.699 
so it's pretty good I've watched this a
few<00:03:51.250> times<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.540> still<00:03:52.930> retains<00:03:53.140> his

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
few times and it still retains his

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.830 
few times and it still retains his
bounciness<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.060> its<00:03:55.239> softness

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
bounciness and its softness

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.170 
bounciness and its softness
so<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> pretty<00:03:56.860> good<00:03:57.100> sweater<00:03:57.640> plus

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
so this is a pretty good sweater plus

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.310 
so this is a pretty good sweater plus
it's<00:03:58.510> only<00:03:58.660> 7<00:03:59.320> thin<00:03:59.820> 80<00:04:00.820> USD<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.630> think<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.200> it

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
it's only 7 thin 80 USD I think so it

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.699 
it's only 7 thin 80 USD I think so it
was<00:04:02.440> about<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:02.829> 27<00:04:03.310> sing<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.870> was<00:04:05.019> really

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
was about like 27 sing and it was really

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.560 
was about like 27 sing and it was really
really<00:04:05.950> cheap<00:04:06.250> compared<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.000> wall<00:04:07.329> fox

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
really cheap compared to the wall fox

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.310 
really cheap compared to the wall fox
run<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.989> also<00:04:08.200> picked<00:04:08.650> up<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:09.040> same<00:04:09.780> style<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:11.049> a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
run I also picked up the same style in a

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.710 
run I also picked up the same style in a
mint<00:04:11.620> green<00:04:11.709> with<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.190> pink<00:04:12.579> heart<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.150> I

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
mint green with a pink heart and I

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.130 
mint green with a pink heart and I
really<00:04:14.140> liked<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:14.620> jumper<00:04:15.630> for<00:04:16.630> twinning

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
really liked this jumper for twinning

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.849 
really liked this jumper for twinning
over<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.410> box

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
over the box
