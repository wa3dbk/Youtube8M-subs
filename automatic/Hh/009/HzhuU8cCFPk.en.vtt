00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 good morning and welcome back to medicine 33 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.150
 when the arteries risk closing 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 to ensure blood flow yes 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.309
 apply the stents are tubes a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.550
 net that keep the arteries open 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 now there are new types 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 absorbable that avoid those little ones 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 problems that could have been a past 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 and then we'll talk about amyloidosis is is one 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.609
 disease a group of diseases actually 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 where there is a deposit in the fabrics of 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.469
 abnormal and very important proteins 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 diagnose in time to be able to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.329
 finally take care of an expert in the studio 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.129
 we'll talk about cholesterol cholesterol 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.460
 good bad cholesterol 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.980
 what to eat to stay but let's start 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.140
 from the stale we said something new in this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.239
 field now exists those reabsorbable 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.149
 less and less invasive we feel advocate 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 62 years have been implanted 4 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.530
 stand one in metal 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.199
 the other three absorbable intervention is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.750
 lasted about an hour it is made with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 local anesthesia the stay lasts about 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.490
 a day and a half two normal life 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.430
 after how much recovery was normal yes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.680
 means work right away if by normal 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.680
 means sport city ​​for sports people 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 rather than movement a little more than 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 usually maybe ten days one 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 week no more than angioplasty 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 came into use in 1977 from which everything 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.950
 it begins but today it appears primitive yes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 it was about inflating a balloon and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.390
 breaking the plaque has passed 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.619
 the advent of the mykhaylo stents around the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.380
 Achilles heel 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 cell proliferation starting 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.270
 from the wall of the treated artery that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 rio closed the stent then the idea is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 was to apply a drug to the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.869
 device to finally arrive at the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.290
 stent that is reabsorbed reality is called 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.990
 scaffold a term is an English term 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.390
 which has the same purpose as the stent e 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 that is, keep the coronary open 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 but it is no longer composed of a league 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.679
 metallic like all of stents up to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.720
 now in use but of a polymer of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.550
 once he has done 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 function and restored a patency 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.550
 so good channeling 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.130
 of the artery the polymer melts yes 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.800
 reabsorbs this is a coronary la 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.740
 see you see the introduction of the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.720
 slip with our stent on it 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.580
 absorbable which is expanded and 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.820
 the water contained in the wall 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.090
 low-level arterial hydrolyzed e 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.630
 material disappears and then the artery 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.630
 his punctuality returns to his 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.610
 normal physiology interventions that 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.280
 to the cardiology unit of the center 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.140
 cardio monzino di milano unique in 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.240
 italy specialized in the heart yes 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.320
 they practice every day we introduce 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.950
 this thin wire of the radial artery 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.940
 and on this line lady feels nothing 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.330
 magnificent on this end we introduce the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.150
 our introducer that our door 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.310
 entrance towards the heart we will advance 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.870
 superfine guide the balloon 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.209
 right here at the moment we are 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.180
 in the stenosis it swells remole 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.950
 we will widen the artery to give space 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.810
 to the passage of our time 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.980
 now we are advancing and the other is trying 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.050
 and to complete the work 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.780
 in this case we intervene on more 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.480
 arteries and with more difficulty also in Italy 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.090
 5 would cost state and at other times a 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.070
 triple bypass coronary artery 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.989
 meanwhile the patient operated two years ago 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.620
 came to do a new coronography 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.780
 I had four metal 1 rooms 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.540
 which of course I still hope in office 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.790
 that the other three are in fact 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.580
 were they were absorbable that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.390
 I assume it is themselves being reabsorbed into 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.890
 toto 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.410
 you 're still metallic 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.500
 very valid and still used 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.920
 in a large percentage of patients 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.590
 so whoever has a metal stand must 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.890
 feel comfortable here notice the result 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.750
 at a distance the net and the metallic stent 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.560
 which was placed in the highest part 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.700
 of the earth while the dots 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.590
 mark the beginning to the end 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.320
 of stents 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 or implanted resorbable scaffolds 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.560
 in the artery it has been seen that this 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.810
 polymer reabsorbs within two 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.340
 years generating carbon dioxide e 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.880
 water therefore absolutely substance 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.590
 biocompatible a truly application 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.350
 changed the relative life of the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.130
 patients and the use of this technique 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.130
 in acute myocardial infarction
