then put it on

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.910 
then put it on
and<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.480> always<00:01:16.720> use<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.140> smallest<00:01:17.380> ball<00:01:17.680> tool

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920

and I always use the smallest ball tool
to<00:01:18.070> do<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:18.340> it's<00:01:18.550> just<00:01:18.610> easier<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.830> then<00:01:20.950> I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
to do this it's just easier into then I

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.430 
to do this it's just easier into then I
just<00:01:21.190> shape<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.580> some<00:01:21.790> while<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.120> on<00:01:22.270> the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
just shape it some while it's on the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.560 
just shape it some while it's on the
body<00:01:23.440> or<00:01:23.640> ghost<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.880> guess<00:01:25.060> ghost<00:01:25.300> doesn't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
body or ghost I guess ghost doesn't
