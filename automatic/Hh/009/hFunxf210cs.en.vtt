as<00:00:07.970> animals<00:00:08.360> go<00:00:08.660> humans<00:00:09.590> are<00:00:09.920> weird

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:10.970 
as animals go humans are weird

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.720 
as animals go humans are weird
I<00:00:11.000> mean<00:00:11.410> really<00:00:12.410> weird<00:00:12.590> with<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.309> only

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
I mean really weird with the only

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.420 
I mean really weird with the only
animals<00:00:14.180> to<00:00:14.299> drink<00:00:14.719> milk<00:00:14.990> beyond<00:00:15.469> infancy<00:00:15.799> and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
animals to drink milk beyond infancy and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.010 
animals to drink milk beyond infancy and
with<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.790> only<00:00:17.000> animals<00:00:17.360> to<00:00:17.450> drink<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.840> milk

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
with the only animals to drink the milk

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.529 
with the only animals to drink the milk
of<00:00:18.230> other<00:00:18.650> animals<00:00:19.430> which<00:00:19.970> is<00:00:20.120> pretty<00:00:20.270> gross

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
of other animals which is pretty gross

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.260 
of other animals which is pretty gross
so<00:00:21.320> why<00:00:21.950> do<00:00:22.010> we<00:00:22.100> do<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:22.850> should<00:00:23.120> we<00:00:23.240> be

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
so why do we do it and should we be

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.610 
so why do we do it and should we be
doing<00:00:23.390> it<00:00:23.720> in<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.870> first<00:00:24.110> place

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
doing it in the first place

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.250 
doing it in the first place
cow<00:00:25.550> milk<00:00:25.760> goes<00:00:26.000> to<00:00:26.180> produce<00:00:26.450> all<00:00:26.690> sorts<00:00:26.750> of

our foods from Lhasa creamed cheese and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.799 
our foods from Lhasa creamed cheese and
yogurts<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:30.740> cows<00:00:30.950> have<00:00:31.430> literally<00:00:32.029> changed

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
yogurts but cows have literally changed

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.990 
yogurts but cows have literally changed
our<00:00:32.960> lives<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.559> along<00:00:33.829> with<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.190> our<00:00:34.399> very

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
genes and our evolution so to find out

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.549 
genes and our evolution so to find out
how<00:00:37.910> we've<00:00:38.449> come<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.870> University<00:00:39.469> of

how we've come to University of
Bristol's<00:00:39.949> Windhurst<00:00:40.429> farm<00:00:40.760> this<00:00:41.059> is<00:00:41.329> a

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
Holstein Friesian cow and she can

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.419 
Holstein Friesian cow and she can
produce<00:00:43.879> more<00:00:44.420> milk<00:00:44.690> every<00:00:45.440> year<00:00:45.710> than<00:00:46.129> any

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
produce more milk every year than any

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.000 
produce more milk every year than any
other<00:00:46.579> dairy<00:00:47.030> animal<00:00:47.449> on<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.870> planet<00:00:48.050> that's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
other dairy animal on the planet that's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.149 
other dairy animal on the planet that's
10,000<00:00:49.940> litres<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.359> year<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.989> that's<00:00:51.260> 60,000

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
10,000 litres a year and that's 60,000

bowls<00:00:52.339> of<00:00:52.550> cereal<00:00:52.789> at<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.420> girl<00:00:53.859> but<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.920> only

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
bowls of cereal at a girl but the only

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.829 
bowls of cereal at a girl but the only
reason<00:00:55.339> she<00:00:55.519> can<00:00:55.699> do<00:00:55.819> that<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.390> because<00:00:56.569> we

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
reason she can do that is because we

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.719 
reason she can do that is because we
made<00:00:57.109> her<00:00:57.319> that<00:00:57.469> way<00:00:57.530> with<00:00:58.219> selective

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
made her that way with selective

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.360 
made her that way with selective
breeding<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.269> evolution<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.920> first<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.309> all

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
breeding and evolution so first of all

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.849 
breeding and evolution so first of all
let's<00:01:01.789> find<00:01:02.089> out<00:01:02.300> what<00:01:02.479> we<00:01:02.629> mean<00:01:02.659> by<00:01:03.079> selective

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
let's find out what we mean by selective

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.370 
let's find out what we mean by selective
breeding<00:01:03.889> and<00:01:04.430> have<00:01:04.760> back<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.089> at<00:01:05.180> Bristol<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
breeding and have back to at Bristol so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.690 
breeding and have back to at Bristol so
for<00:01:06.530> us<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.650> understand<00:01:07.100> selective<00:01:07.520> breeding

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
for us to understand selective breeding

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.819 
for us to understand selective breeding
we<00:01:08.120> first<00:01:08.390> need<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.630> think<00:01:08.810> about<00:01:08.900> evolution

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
we first need to think about evolution

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.709 
we first need to think about evolution
now<00:01:10.130> when<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:10.490> comes<00:01:10.579> to<00:01:10.759> evolution<00:01:10.939> I've

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
now when it comes to evolution I've

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.690 
now when it comes to evolution I've
always<00:01:12.079> heard<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.409> term<00:01:12.649> survival<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.579> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
always heard of the term survival of the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.609 
always heard of the term survival of the
fittest<00:01:13.939> what<00:01:14.659> do<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:14.810> mean<00:01:14.960> by<00:01:14.990> fittest<00:01:15.439> is

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
fittest what do we mean by fittest is

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.050 
fittest what do we mean by fittest is
that<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.009> strongest<00:01:16.549> animal<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:16.969> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
that just a strongest animal in the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.999 
that just a strongest animal in the
group<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:17.719> we<00:01:18.110> would<00:01:18.229> usually<00:01:18.439> be<00:01:18.619> talking

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
group so we would usually be talking

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.100 
group so we would usually be talking
about<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.369> animals<00:01:19.729> which<00:01:20.000> are<00:01:20.270> best<00:01:20.689> suited

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
about the animals which are best suited

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.959 
about the animals which are best suited
to<00:01:21.140> their<00:01:21.380> environment<00:01:21.950> such<00:01:22.280> as<00:01:22.310> having<00:01:22.640> a

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
to their environment such as having a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.399 
to their environment such as having a
really<00:01:23.240> good<00:01:23.299> sense<00:01:23.539> of<00:01:23.659> smell<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.229> can

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
really good sense of smell so you can

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.130 
really good sense of smell so you can
smell<00:01:25.219> a<00:01:25.280> predator<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:26.119> sniff<00:01:26.630> out<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.810> food

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
smell a predator or sniff out a food

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.260 
smell a predator or sniff out a food
source<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.680> enhance<00:01:28.189> your<00:01:28.340> survival<00:01:28.789> so<00:01:29.060> only

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
source to enhance your survival so only

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.149 
source to enhance your survival so only
the<00:01:29.539> animals<00:01:29.930> with<00:01:30.079> those<00:01:30.289> characteristics

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
the animals with those characteristics

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.670 
the animals with those characteristics
are<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.490> ones<00:01:31.670> which<00:01:31.909> will<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.570> forward<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.229> be

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
are the ones which will go forward to be

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.649 
are the ones which will go forward to be
the<00:01:33.860> future<00:01:34.219> population<00:01:34.520> that's<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:35.600> we

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
the future population that's what we

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.450 
the future population that's what we
mean<00:01:35.780> by<00:01:35.840> natural<00:01:36.350> selection<00:01:36.380> how<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.310> that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
mean by natural selection how is that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.980 
mean by natural selection how is that
any<00:01:37.670> different<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.329> dairy<00:01:38.600> farm

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
any different on a dairy farm

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
any different on a dairy farm
the<00:01:39.350> main<00:01:39.500> difference<00:01:39.859> would<00:01:39.979> be<00:01:40.039> that<00:01:40.189> it's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
the main difference would be that it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.580 
the main difference would be that it's
human<00:01:41.090> beings<00:01:41.270> which<00:01:41.600> are<00:01:41.780> providing<00:01:42.350> the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
human beings which are providing the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.410 
human beings which are providing the
selection<00:01:43.189> pressures<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.000> it's<00:01:44.149> not<00:01:44.299> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
selection pressures so it's not the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.880 
selection pressures so it's not the
natural<00:01:44.570> selection<00:01:45.200> that's<00:01:45.289> going<00:01:45.530> on<00:01:45.619> it's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
natural selection that's going on it's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.950 
natural selection that's going on it's
us<00:01:46.219> doing<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.729> choosing<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.240> yeah<00:01:47.810> exactly

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
us doing the choosing for yeah exactly

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.380 
us doing the choosing for yeah exactly
