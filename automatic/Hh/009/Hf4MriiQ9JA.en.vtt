we've got our power pretty long cords

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.969 
we've got our power pretty long cords
which<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.710> nice<00:01:21.610> look<00:01:23.439> completely<00:01:24.439> empty<00:01:24.890> in

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
which is nice look completely empty in

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.940 
which is nice look completely empty in
there<00:01:25.659> kind<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.780> waste<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.110> space

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.779 

all<00:01:30.950> right<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.340> pedals<00:01:33.610> plastic<00:01:34.610> off<00:01:34.759> of

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
all right the pedals plastic off of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.340 
all right the pedals plastic off of
these<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:37.270> pretty<00:01:38.270> much<00:01:38.420> exactly<00:01:38.750> like<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
these so pretty much exactly like the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.740 
these so pretty much exactly like the
g27<00:01:39.830> pedals<00:01:40.459> from<00:01:41.090> what<00:01:41.270> I've<00:01:41.330> heard<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.600> what

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
g27 pedals from what I've heard and what

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.779 
g27 pedals from what I've heard and what
I've<00:01:41.840> seen<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:43.009> big<00:01:43.159> difference<00:01:43.459> though<00:01:43.640> is

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
I've seen the big difference though is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.149 
I've seen the big difference though is
the<00:01:43.909> brake<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.899> brake<00:01:45.170> they've

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
the brake so the brake they've

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.580 
the brake so the brake they've
completely<00:01:46.640> redone<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:48.229> what<00:01:48.470> they're

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
completely redone and it's what they're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.669 
completely redone and it's what they're
calling<00:01:48.799> nonlinear<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> thing<00:01:51.350> about<00:01:51.530> it

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
calling nonlinear and the thing about it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.690 
calling nonlinear and the thing about it
is<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.130> really<00:01:52.340> feels<00:01:52.729> like<00:01:54.310> real<00:01:55.310> brake

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
is it really feels like real brake

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.900 
is it really feels like real brake
pedals<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:56.420> would<00:01:56.539> have<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:57.729> like<00:01:58.729> in<00:01:58.819> a

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
pedals that you would have for like in a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.300 
pedals that you would have for like in a
car<00:01:59.179> with<00:01:59.509> like<00:02:00.170> powered<00:02:00.530> assist<00:02:00.860> braking

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
car with like powered assist braking

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.710 
car with like powered assist braking
that<00:02:01.459> sort<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.759> thing<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:03.110> other<00:02:03.229> than<00:02:03.319> that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
that sort of thing but other than that

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.119 
that sort of thing but other than that
like<00:02:05.720> this<00:02:05.929> feels<00:02:06.170> totally<00:02:06.440> different<00:02:06.649> than

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
like this feels totally different than

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.130 
like this feels totally different than
the<00:02:07.280> than<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> accelerator<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> clutch

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
the than the accelerator and the clutch

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.830 
the than the accelerator and the clutch
clutch<00:02:09.349> has<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> little<00:02:09.830> more<00:02:10.450> spring<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.720> as

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
clutch has a little more spring to it as

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.680 
clutch has a little more spring to it as
well<00:02:14.050> again<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> pretty<00:02:15.590> long<00:02:16.000> cable<00:02:18.310> with

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
well again a pretty long cable with

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.869 
well again a pretty long cable with
connector<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.519> flip<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.640> over<00:02:22.730> now

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
connector like that flip it over now

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.369 
connector like that flip it over now
this<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.180> one<00:02:23.300> thing<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.840> Logitech

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
this is one thing that I like Logitech

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.089 
this is one thing that I like Logitech
has<00:02:24.650> over<00:02:25.750> thrust<00:02:26.750> master<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.349> they<00:02:27.739> have<00:02:27.920> this

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
has over thrust master is they have this

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.820 
has over thrust master is they have this
carpet<00:02:28.640> catcher<00:02:28.879> thing<00:02:29.530> which<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.650> remember

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
carpet catcher thing which I remember

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.149 
carpet catcher thing which I remember
how<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.129> exactly<00:02:32.470> pop<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.769> moment<00:02:34.069> but

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
how to exactly pop out at the moment but

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.710 
how to exactly pop out at the moment but
it's<00:02:34.459> got<00:02:34.640> these<00:02:34.760> little<00:02:34.879> teeth<00:02:35.239> on<00:02:35.450> it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it's got these little teeth on it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.470 
it's got these little teeth on it
and<00:02:36.349> if<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.430> have<00:02:37.519> carpeting<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.180> actually

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
and if you have carpeting it actually

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.619 
and if you have carpeting it actually
grabs<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.319> well<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.010> keeps<00:02:40.129> it<00:02:40.340> from

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
grabs on really well so it keeps it from

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.360 
grabs on really well so it keeps it from
pushing<00:02:41.629> forward<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.560> you're

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
pushing forward on you when you're

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
pushing forward on you when you're
pushing<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.849> pedals<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:47.080> but<00:02:48.080> yeah<00:02:48.230> pretty

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
pushing on the pedals so but yeah pretty

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.470 
pushing on the pedals so but yeah pretty
much<00:02:48.590> almost<00:02:48.860> exactly<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.580> g20<00:02:49.909> 7's

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
much almost exactly like the g20 7's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.660 
much almost exactly like the g20 7's
they<00:02:51.230> look<00:02:51.470> exactly<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:52.040> same<00:02:52.129> actually<00:02:52.489> I

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
they look exactly the same actually I

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.789 
they look exactly the same actually I
think<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.840> logo<00:02:54.230> might<00:02:54.379> be<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.709> bit

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
think the logo might be a little bit

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.860 
think the logo might be a little bit
different<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.280> that's<00:02:55.430> about<00:02:55.549> it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
different but that's about it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:05.430 
different but that's about it
and<00:02:57.769> then<00:02:59.500> wheel<00:03:00.500> itself<00:03:03.099> box<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.280> little<00:03:04.489> bit

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
and then wheel itself box a little bit

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.390 
and then wheel itself box a little bit
you<00:03:06.440> get<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.800> crazy<00:03:07.610> plastic<00:03:08.300> off<00:03:12.400> so

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
you get all this crazy plastic off so

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
you get all this crazy plastic off so
there's<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.000> wheel<00:03:14.269> itself<00:03:16.390> kind<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.510> modeled

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
there's the wheel itself kind of modeled

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.580 
there's the wheel itself kind of modeled
more<00:03:18.170> after<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:19.690> GT<00:03:20.690> force<00:03:21.019> pro<00:03:21.319> or<00:03:21.560> the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
more after the GT force pro or the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.460 
more after the GT force pro or the
Porsche<00:03:21.950> GT<00:03:22.599> which<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.840> wheel<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.019> lot<00:03:24.349> of

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
Porsche GT which is the wheel a lot of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.289 
Porsche GT which is the wheel a lot of
people<00:03:24.709> had<00:03:24.860> back<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.610> PlayStation<00:03:26.090> 3

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
people had back in the PlayStation 3

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.729 
people had back in the PlayStation 3
days<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> you've<00:03:27.799> got<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.190> 24<00:03:29.170> slot<00:03:30.170> selector

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
days so you've got the 24 slot selector

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.539 
days so you've got the 24 slot selector
here<00:03:31.130> your<00:03:31.760> enter<00:03:33.459> want<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.519> block<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.239> light

PlayStation button l3 and r3 which I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.770 
PlayStation button l3 and r3 which I
think<00:03:42.620> are<00:03:42.709> also<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:44.000> shifter<00:03:44.329> here<00:03:44.599> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
think are also on the shifter here the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.369 
think are also on the shifter here the
patent<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.530> flappy<00:03:45.950> paddles<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:47.260> really<00:03:48.260> like

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
patent the flappy paddles I really like

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.690 
patent the flappy paddles I really like
the<00:03:48.500> layout<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:48.950> though<00:03:49.129> especially

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
the layout of this though especially

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.449 
the layout of this though especially
with<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.900> buttons<00:03:51.260> being<00:03:51.829> over<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.250> side

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
with the buttons being over to the side

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.619 
with the buttons being over to the side
a<00:03:52.489> little<00:03:52.670> bit<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.180> they're<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> lot

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
a little bit like this they're a lot

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.009 
a little bit like this they're a lot
more<00:03:53.810> accessible<00:03:54.140> I<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.890> quite<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.250> bit

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
more accessible I like that quite a bit

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.160 
more accessible I like that quite a bit
also<00:03:57.019> you'll<00:03:57.620> see<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.690> flat<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:00.079> the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
also you'll see this is flat on the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.390 
also you'll see this is flat on the
bottom<00:04:01.090> very<00:04:02.090> subtly<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:04.069> also<00:04:04.250> a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
bottom very subtly and it's also a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.080 
bottom very subtly and it's also a
leather-bound<00:04:05.410> wheel<00:04:06.410> right<00:04:06.650> away<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.940> it's

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
leather-bound wheel right away so it's

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.610 
leather-bound wheel right away so it's
not<00:04:08.239> any<00:04:08.450> rubber<00:04:08.720> anything<00:04:09.200> like<00:04:09.319> that<00:04:09.380> like

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
not any rubber anything like that like

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.920 
not any rubber anything like that like
the<00:04:09.769> thrust<00:04:10.010> master<00:04:10.510> t---three<00:04:11.510> hundred<00:04:11.810> is

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the thrust master t---three hundred is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.420 
the thrust master t---three hundred is
actually<00:04:12.230> rubberized<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:13.040> one<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.280> comes

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
actually rubberized the one that comes

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.509 
actually rubberized the one that comes
with<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.200> also<00:04:15.200> comparing<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.280> thrust

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
with it and also comparing to the thrust

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.069 
with it and also comparing to the thrust
master<00:04:16.880> there's<00:04:17.299> only<00:04:17.479> comes<00:04:17.720> with<00:04:17.900> two

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
master there's only comes with two

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.020 
master there's only comes with two
pedals<00:04:18.440> so<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.340> comes<00:04:19.549> with<00:04:19.639> all<00:04:19.820> three

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
pedals so this comes with all three

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.080 
pedals so this comes with all three
pedals<00:04:20.329> right<00:04:20.359> away<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:22.520> flappy<00:04:22.820> paddles

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
pedals right away the flappy paddles

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.300 
pedals right away the flappy paddles
actually<00:04:23.360> feel<00:04:23.479> pretty<00:04:23.510> good<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:25.190> them

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
actually feel pretty good I like them

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.560 
actually feel pretty good I like them
quite<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> bit<00:04:25.580> they're<00:04:25.789> extended<00:04:26.210> quite<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.389> bit

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
quite a bit they're extended quite a bit

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.659 
quite a bit they're extended quite a bit
as<00:04:26.630> well

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
as well

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.969 
as well
this<00:04:28.669> uses<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.300> clamp<00:04:29.750> system<00:04:29.960> that<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.530> g27

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
this uses the clamp system that the g27

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.409 
this uses the clamp system that the g27
or<00:04:31.220> all<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.370> other<00:04:31.490> ones<00:04:31.639> used<00:04:31.849> so<00:04:32.090> it's<00:04:32.240> two

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
or all the other ones used so it's two

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.750 
or all the other ones used so it's two
clamps<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.960> turn<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.970> up<00:04:35.210> here<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.760> it's

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
clamps you turn this up here so it's

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.260 
clamps you turn this up here so it's
like<00:04:37.849> spring-loaded<00:04:39.099> and<00:04:40.099> you<00:04:40.520> turn<00:04:40.849> it<00:04:41.030> which

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
like spring-loaded and you turn it which

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.279 
like spring-loaded and you turn it which
I'm<00:04:41.750> not<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.050> big<00:04:42.110> fan<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:45.020> one<00:04:45.139> of

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
I'm not a big fan of the one the one of

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.060 
I'm not a big fan of the one the one of
my<00:04:45.380> GT<00:04:45.919> force<00:04:46.220> Pro<00:04:46.490> actually<00:04:46.970> has<00:04:47.300> broken<00:04:47.660> now

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
my GT force Pro actually has broken now

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.900 
my GT force Pro actually has broken now
this<00:04:49.070> piece<00:04:49.280> right<00:04:49.430> here<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.700> actually

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
this piece right here is actually

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.350 
this piece right here is actually
snapped<00:04:50.360> off<00:04:50.599> so<00:04:51.490> not<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.520> huge<00:04:52.940> fan<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.180> that

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
snapped off so not a huge fan of that

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.800 
snapped off so not a huge fan of that
but<00:04:53.840> it'll<00:04:54.260> probably<00:04:54.530> alright<00:04:55.539> move<00:04:56.539> into<00:04:56.660> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
but it'll probably alright move into the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.129 
but it'll probably alright move into the
back<00:04:57.310> some<00:04:58.310> styling<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.780> looks<00:04:59.900> like<00:05:00.020> in

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
back some styling and looks like in

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.610 
back some styling and looks like in
front<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.560> Mustang<00:05:01.160> actually<00:05:02.380> underneath<00:05:03.380> I

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
front of a Mustang actually underneath I

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.260 
front of a Mustang actually underneath I
do<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:04.099> this<00:05:04.310> -<00:05:04.520> they've<00:05:04.700> got<00:05:04.849> some<00:05:04.969> cable

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
do like this - they've got some cable

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.750 
do like this - they've got some cable
management<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.169> if<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.890> have<00:05:07.070> too<00:05:07.219> much<00:05:07.340> cable

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
management so if you have too much cable

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.880 
management so if you have too much cable
you're<00:05:08.750> able<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:08.990> actually<00:05:09.169> kind<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.530> wind<00:05:09.770> it

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
you're able to actually kind of wind it

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.840 
you're able to actually kind of wind it
up

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
up

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.950 
up
really<00:05:11.850> long<00:05:12.030> USB<00:05:12.450> cable<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:13.110> always<00:05:13.320> nice

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
really long USB cable that's always nice

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.390 
really long USB cable that's always nice
the<00:05:15.960> longer<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.350> better<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:17.130> can<00:05:17.280> always

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the longer the better you can always

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.460 
the longer the better you can always
clamp<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.790> up<00:05:17.880> again<00:05:18.570> cable<00:05:18.930> management<00:05:19.080> here

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
clamp it up again cable management here

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.170 
clamp it up again cable management here
though<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.600> then<00:05:22.730> it's<00:05:23.730> going<00:05:23.820> to<00:05:23.880> be<00:05:23.970> kind<00:05:24.150> of

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
though and then it's going to be kind of

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.909 
though and then it's going to be kind of
hard<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.450> see<00:05:24.720> but<00:05:25.880> there's<00:05:26.880> your<00:05:27.300> plugs<00:05:29.480> for

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
hard to see but there's your plugs for

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.480 
hard to see but there's your plugs for
you<00:05:31.919> know<00:05:32.040> what<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.310> one<00:05:32.460> is

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
you know what that one is

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.510 
you know what that one is
hmm<00:05:36.290> that's<00:05:37.290> for<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.590> shifter<00:05:38.040> over<00:05:38.280> here

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
hmm that's for the shifter over here

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.300 
hmm that's for the shifter over here
whoops<00:05:38.760> sorry<00:05:38.970> that's<00:05:39.600> for<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.870> shifter

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
whoops sorry that's for the shifter

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.659 
whoops sorry that's for the shifter
that's<00:05:41.310> for<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.550> pedals<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:43.250> then<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.340> USB

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
that's for the pedals and then the USB

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:45.770 
that's for the pedals and then the USB
is<00:05:44.729> already<00:05:44.910> coming<00:05:45.060> out<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.389> I<00:05:45.510> don't<00:05:45.540> see

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
is already coming out of it I don't see

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.330 
is already coming out of it I don't see
the<00:05:45.900> popper<00:05:46.169> oh<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.770> powers<00:05:47.040> over<00:05:47.220> in<00:05:47.280> the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
the popper oh the powers over in the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.969 
the popper oh the powers over in the
corner<00:05:47.669> they're<00:05:48.020> right<00:05:49.020> next<00:05:49.169> to<00:05:49.470> it<00:05:49.770> so<00:05:49.889> they

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
corner they're right next to it so they

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:50.870 
corner they're right next to it so they
get<00:05:50.100> some<00:05:50.250> light<00:05:50.400> on<00:05:50.580> it

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
get some light on it

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.040 
get some light on it
there's<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.900> power<00:05:52.110> right<00:05:52.290> down<00:05:52.470> there<00:05:54.050> so

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
there's the power right down there so

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.110 
there's the power right down there so
there<00:05:55.200> you<00:05:55.290> have<00:05:55.350> it<00:05:55.610> I'll<00:05:56.610> be<00:05:56.729> doing<00:05:56.940> some

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
there you have it I'll be doing some

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.840 
there you have it I'll be doing some
testing<00:05:57.450> with<00:05:57.510> this<00:05:57.919> for<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:58.950> full<00:05:59.490> review<00:05:59.669> soon

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
testing with this for a full review soon

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.330 
testing with this for a full review soon
and<00:06:02.850> we'll<00:06:03.240> obviously<00:06:03.479> be<00:06:04.220> comparing<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.280> to

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
and we'll obviously be comparing it to

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.629 
and we'll obviously be comparing it to
the<00:06:05.610> Thrustmaster<00:06:06.919> since<00:06:07.919> they're<00:06:08.040> both<00:06:08.130> the

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
the Thrustmaster since they're both the

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.879 
the Thrustmaster since they're both the
same<00:06:08.790> price<00:06:08.940> point<00:06:09.210> 400<00:06:09.750> bucks<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:10.290> mean

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
same price point 400 bucks I mean

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.890 
same price point 400 bucks I mean
obviously<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.520> Thrustmaster<00:06:11.820> you're<00:06:12.780> not

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
obviously the Thrustmaster you're not

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.090 
obviously the Thrustmaster you're not
getting<00:06:13.139> three<00:06:13.320> pedals<00:06:13.470> you're<00:06:13.680> getting<00:06:13.860> two

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
getting three pedals you're getting two

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.850 
getting three pedals you're getting two
you're<00:06:14.880> getting<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:15.150> leather<00:06:15.390> bound<00:06:15.860> steering

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
you're getting a leather bound steering

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.200 
you're getting a leather bound steering
wheel<00:06:17.010> with<00:06:17.160> this<00:06:17.280> one<00:06:17.460> right<00:06:17.580> away<00:06:17.820> whereas

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
wheel with this one right away whereas

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.490 
wheel with this one right away whereas
the<00:06:18.300> thrust<00:06:18.539> masters<00:06:18.870> rubberized<00:06:19.260> one<00:06:19.440> you

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
the thrust masters rubberized one you

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.740 
the thrust masters rubberized one you
can<00:06:19.620> buy<00:06:19.770> one<00:06:19.950> separately<00:06:20.400> I<00:06:20.610> don't<00:06:21.450> know<00:06:21.630> if

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
can buy one separately I don't know if

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.570 
can buy one separately I don't know if
the<00:06:21.870> wheels<00:06:22.080> detachable<00:06:22.800> endless<00:06:23.130> like<00:06:23.340> it<00:06:23.460> is

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
the wheels detachable endless like it is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.980 
the wheels detachable endless like it is
on<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.850> thrust<00:06:24.090> master<00:06:24.450> though<00:06:24.600> so<00:06:24.810> that's

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
on the thrust master though so that's

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.140 
on the thrust master though so that's
one<00:06:25.410> big<00:06:25.590> difference<00:06:25.710> right<00:06:25.979> there

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
one big difference right there

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.909 
one big difference right there
the<00:06:27.479> t<00:06:27.630> 300<00:06:28.050> offers<00:06:28.350> you<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.500> little<00:06:28.710> bit<00:06:28.800> more

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
the t 300 offers you a little bit more

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.430 
the t 300 offers you a little bit more
expandability<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:30.539> shifter<00:06:30.930> for<00:06:31.110> this<00:06:31.229> is

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
expandability the shifter for this is

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.900 
expandability the shifter for this is
bought<00:06:31.620> separately<00:06:32.010> does<00:06:32.280> not<00:06:32.430> come<00:06:32.669> with<00:06:32.789> it

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
bought separately does not come with it

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.480 
bought separately does not come with it
like<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.030> did<00:06:33.240> with<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.419> g27<00:06:33.810> and<00:06:34.320> I<00:06:35.250> believe

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
like I did with the g27 and I believe

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.270 
like I did with the g27 and I believe
it's<00:06:35.610> around<00:06:35.700> 60<00:06:36.240> bucks<00:06:36.570> it's<00:06:37.169> not<00:06:38.100> as

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
it's around 60 bucks it's not as

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.129 
it's around 60 bucks it's not as
elaborate<00:06:38.970> as<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.210> thrust<00:06:39.389> master<00:06:39.780> shifter

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
elaborate as the thrust master shifter

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.890 
elaborate as the thrust master shifter
but<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:41.490> does<00:06:41.669> work<00:06:41.820> I<00:06:41.940> user<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:42.270> d3<00:06:42.419> works

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
but it does work I user to d3 works

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.350 
but it does work I user to d3 works
really<00:06:43.080> well<00:06:43.289> it's<00:06:43.710> a<00:06:43.770> little<00:06:43.919> bit<00:06:44.010> smaller

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
really well it's a little bit smaller

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.820 
really well it's a little bit smaller
doesn't<00:06:45.360> have<00:06:45.479> all<00:06:45.600> the<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:46.139> buttons<00:06:46.500> on<00:06:46.710> it

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
doesn't have all the the buttons on it

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.969 
doesn't have all the the buttons on it
like<00:06:46.979> it<00:06:47.130> did<00:06:48.110> with<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.260> g27

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
like it did with the g27

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.950 
like it did with the g27
so<00:06:50.280> that's<00:06:50.400> a<00:06:50.490> big<00:06:50.610> difference<00:06:50.760> but<00:06:51.120> now<00:06:51.780> it's

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
so that's a big difference but now it's

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.000 
so that's a big difference but now it's
because<00:06:52.169> they're<00:06:52.289> all<00:06:52.410> in<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.590> wheel<00:06:52.710> unlike

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
because they're all in the wheel unlike

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.830 
because they're all in the wheel unlike
the<00:06:53.130> g27<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.880> only<00:06:54.000> had<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:54.300> six<00:06:54.539> buttons

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
the g27 that only had the six buttons

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.420 
the g27 that only had the six buttons
and<00:06:55.220> then<00:06:56.220> if<00:06:56.580> you're<00:06:56.700> asking<00:06:58.130> there's<00:06:59.130> the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
and then if you're asking there's the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.170 
and then if you're asking there's the
switch<00:06:59.729> right<00:07:00.000> there<00:07:01.729> to<00:07:02.729> switch<00:07:02.940> it<00:07:03.090> between

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
switch right there to switch it between

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.879 
switch right there to switch it between
ps3<00:07:03.930> and<00:07:04.050> ps4<00:07:04.200> mode<00:07:05.389> right<00:07:06.389> there<00:07:06.770> so<00:07:07.770> that's

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
ps3 and ps4 mode right there so that's

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.360 
ps3 and ps4 mode right there so that's
how<00:07:08.010> you<00:07:08.070> switch<00:07:08.310> it<00:07:09.350> so<00:07:10.350> there<00:07:10.500> you<00:07:10.620> go

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
how you switch it so there you go

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.540 
how you switch it so there you go
retails<00:07:12.240> three<00:07:12.479> $99.99<00:07:13.260> we'll<00:07:14.220> be<00:07:14.280> putting<00:07:14.460> a
