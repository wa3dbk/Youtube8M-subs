shear<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:24.109> Irvine<00:00:25.460> well<00:00:26.570> why<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
shear in Irvine well why don't we have a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.049 
shear in Irvine well why don't we have a
look<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.599> harmonics<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:35.059> look

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
look at harmonics now to really look

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.310 
look at harmonics now to really look
carefully<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:37.079> are<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
carefully we are going to have to

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
carefully we are going to have to
understand<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.730> function<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
understand that the function of the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.520 
understand that the function of the
bridge<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.850> stop<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.960> string<00:00:46.260> from

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bridge is to stop the string from

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
bridge is to stop the string from
vibrating<00:00:47.690> over<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.829> back<00:00:50.070> side<00:00:50.780> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
vibrating over here on the back side and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160 
vibrating over here on the back side and
then<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> nut<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.090> stops<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
then we have the nut here it stops the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.939 
then we have the nut here it stops the
string<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.680> vibrating<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.680> head<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
string from vibrating in the head of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
string from vibrating in the head of the
violin<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> means<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> distance

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
violin so it means that the distance

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.139 
violin so it means that the distance
that<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.259> is<00:01:04.289> vibrating<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.580> from

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
that we have which is vibrating is from

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:14.270 
that we have which is vibrating is from
the<00:01:07.110> bridge<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> nut<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:12.470> when<00:01:13.470> strings

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the bridge to the nut now when strings

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.510 
the bridge to the nut now when strings
vibrate<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.689> circular

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
vibrate it's not just one circular

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.649 
vibrate it's not just one circular
vibration<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.080> divides<00:01:22.080> itself<00:01:23.509> for<00:01:24.509> example

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
vibration it divides itself for example

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.410 
vibration it divides itself for example
it<00:01:25.500> divides<00:01:25.920> itself<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> halfway<00:01:27.000> point

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it divides itself at the halfway point

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.590 
it divides itself at the halfway point
here<00:01:29.420> approximately<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> you've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
here approximately so you've got this

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
here approximately so you've got this
part<00:01:35.000> vibrating<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.290> you've<00:01:37.470> got<00:01:37.909> this

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
part vibrating and then you've got this

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
part vibrating and then you've got this
part<00:01:39.950> vibrating<00:01:41.270> not<00:01:42.270> only<00:01:42.600> does<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.900> divide

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
part vibrating not only does it divide

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.580 
part vibrating not only does it divide
itself<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.360> halfway<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.350> into

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
itself at the halfway point but into

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.990 
itself at the halfway point but into
quarters<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.820> you've<00:01:48.030> got<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:49.200> part

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
quarters so you've got this part

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.450 
quarters so you've got this part
vibrating<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.960> part<00:01:52.820> vibrating<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.810> part

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.810 
vibrating this part vibrating this part
vibrating<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.960> part<00:01:58.579> vibrating<00:01:59.579> now<00:02:01.369> why<00:02:02.369> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
vibrating this part vibrating now why is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.740 
vibrating this part vibrating now why is
it<00:02:02.880> necessary<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.990> understand<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> well

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
it necessary to understand that well

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.059 
it necessary to understand that well
each<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> those<00:02:07.350> points<00:02:09.799> produces<00:02:10.799> what<00:02:11.039> we

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
each of those points produces what we

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.760 
each of those points produces what we
call<00:02:11.220> harmonics

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
call harmonics

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.670 
call harmonics
we've<00:02:13.190> got<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.520> open<00:02:13.700> G<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.200> go<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
we've got an open G and we go to that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.480 
we've got an open G and we go to that
half<00:02:18.920> way<00:02:19.340> point<00:02:19.720> lightly<00:02:20.720> put<00:02:20.960> our<00:02:21.080> finger<00:02:24.490> we

half way point lightly put our finger we

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.090 
half way point lightly put our finger we
get<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.780> harmonic<00:02:27.350> from<00:02:28.330> open<00:02:29.330> G<00:02:29.960> you'll<00:02:30.800> note

go half way between the bridge and the
nut<00:02:49.330> even<00:02:50.330> more<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:53.110> get<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.830> next<00:02:55.070> harmonic

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
nut even more I get the next harmonic

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.160 
nut even more I get the next harmonic
what<00:02:57.050> if<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.320> go<00:02:57.530> even<00:02:57.860> higher<00:02:58.100> I<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.970> even<00:03:02.780> more

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
what if I go even higher I get even more

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.210 
what if I go even higher I get even more
harmonics<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.230> from<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:08.710> all<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.770> way<00:03:09.980> up

harmonics so from here all the way up
there<00:03:11.150> are<00:03:11.680> those<00:03:12.680> harmonics<00:03:13.280> are<00:03:13.430> that's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
there are those harmonics are that's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.170 
there are those harmonics are that's
where<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.810> string<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.350> vibrating

where the string is vibrating
well<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.690> only<00:03:18.020> does<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.260> occur<00:03:20.620> up<00:03:21.620> there

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
well not only does it occur up there

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:32.050 
well not only does it occur up there
it<00:03:23.210> occurs<00:03:26.590> down<00:03:27.590> here<00:03:28.720> now<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.490> go<00:03:31.730> from

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
it occurs down here now if I go from

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.800 
it occurs down here now if I go from
here<00:03:32.380> half<00:03:33.380> way<00:03:33.790> towards<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.030> nut<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:36.410> each

here half way towards the nut and each
finger<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:40.790> going<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.390> produce<00:03:41.540> what<00:03:42.170> we<00:03:42.200> call

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
finger is going to produce what we call

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.200 
finger is going to produce what we call
then<00:03:43.700> all<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.060> these<00:03:44.470> harmonics<00:03:45.470> together

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.590 
then all of these harmonics together
natural<00:03:47.320> harmonics<00:03:48.320> why<00:03:48.800> are<00:03:48.860> they<00:03:49.070> natural

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
natural harmonics why are they natural

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.110 
natural harmonics why are they natural
because<00:03:50.600> they<00:03:50.870> are<00:03:50.990> all<00:03:51.260> coming<00:03:52.100> from<00:03:52.820> or

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
because they are all coming from or

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.920 
because they are all coming from or
being<00:03:53.480> produced<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:54.320> an<00:03:54.980> open<00:03:55.700> string<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:58.930> if

I<00:04:00.640> were<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.700> use<00:04:02.390> my<00:04:02.510> first<00:04:02.960> finger<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:05.230> stop

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
I were to use my first finger and stop

I were to use my first finger and stop
the<00:04:06.620> string<00:04:07.930> reduce<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.710> distance<00:04:10.930> right

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the string reduce the distance right

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.080 
the string reduce the distance right
because<00:04:12.560> it's<00:04:12.740> not<00:04:12.950> going<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.220> vibrate<00:04:13.400> from

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
because it's not going to vibrate from

because it's not going to vibrate from
that<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.650> my<00:04:15.650> first<00:04:15.890> finger<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:18.109> nut<00:04:18.320> now

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
that a my first finger to the nut now

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.130 
that a my first finger to the nut now
this<00:04:19.280> my<00:04:19.700> finger<00:04:20.060> becomes<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.510> nut<00:04:20.660> well<00:04:20.870> I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
this my finger becomes the nut well I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.970 
this my finger becomes the nut well I
too<00:04:22.000> can<00:04:23.000> get

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
too can get

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.180 
too can get
those<00:04:24.550> harmonics<00:04:28.470> all<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.860> which<00:04:30.010> are

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740
