through the rev range and at that point

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.630 
through the rev range and at that point
I'm<00:02:09.020> doing<00:02:09.050> over<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.680> national<00:02:10.070> speed<00:02:10.310> limit

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
due to his stupid speed now he tries to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.559 
due to his stupid speed now he tries to
overtake<00:03:04.590> twice<00:03:05.069> once<00:03:05.549> he<00:03:05.790> doesn't<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
on the grass it's very dangerous when

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:37.210

worthy<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.200> it's<00:03:42.530> something<00:03:42.770> different<00:03:42.920> and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
worthy but it's something different and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.850 
worthy but it's something different and
I've<00:03:44.150> done<00:03:44.360> as<00:03:44.780> I've<00:03:44.960> already<00:03:45.170> said<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.650> not

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
I've done as I've already said do not

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.790 
I've done as I've already said do not
report<00:03:46.310> drivers<00:03:46.940> I've<00:03:47.870> only<00:03:48.020> done<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.320> once

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
report drivers I've only done it once

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.940 
report drivers I've only done it once
and<00:03:49.160> now<00:03:49.730> it's<00:03:49.910> twice<00:03:50.120> I've<00:03:50.390> done<00:03:50.540> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
and now it's twice I've done it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.980 
and now it's twice I've done it
so<00:03:52.300> it's<00:03:53.300> something<00:03:53.570> different

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
so it's something different

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.770 
so it's something different
