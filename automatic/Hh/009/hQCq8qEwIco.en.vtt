00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that good you know and i think that they

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.560 
that good you know and i think that they
made<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> mistake<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.140> whatever<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.299> put<00:01:33.299> on

made a mistake and whatever they put on
this<00:01:33.750> new<00:01:33.960> channel<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:35.100> probably<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.670> going

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this new channel it's probably not going

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.480 
this new channel it's probably not going
to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.180> good<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.040> stuff<00:01:38.280> that
