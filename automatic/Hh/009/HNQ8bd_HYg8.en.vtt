the top of the aquarium and the first
step<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.099> course<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> off<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> there

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
step of course is to get it off of there

then you're going to lose all your good
bacteria<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> we'll<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.020> let<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.290> guy

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
bacteria so we'll just let that guy

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.840 
bacteria so we'll just let that guy
float<00:02:01.740> around<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> that's<00:02:02.640> fine

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
float around in there and that's fine

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
float around in there and that's fine
and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.899> we'll<00:02:04.530> take<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> pickup<00:02:05.460> tube

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and then we'll take out the pickup tube

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.249 
and then we'll take out the pickup tube
here<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.259> salt

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
here and you can just see that salt

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.180 
here and you can just see that salt
creep<00:02:10.560> it'll<00:02:10.739> flake<00:02:10.979> right<00:02:11.009> off

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
creep it'll flake right off

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
creep it'll flake right off
and<00:02:12.430> then<00:02:12.870> my<00:02:13.870> particular<00:02:14.350> filter<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:16.480> these

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and then my particular filter this these

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080 
and then my particular filter this these
two<00:02:17.170> parts<00:02:17.950> come<00:02:18.160> apart<00:02:18.460> or<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> might<00:02:18.850> not<00:02:18.880> be

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
two parts come apart or I might not be

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.420 
two parts come apart or I might not be
able<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.420> with<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:19.780> hand<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:21.070> then<00:02:21.250> when

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
able to do with one hand but then when

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.120 
able to do with one hand but then when
you<00:02:21.520> look<00:02:21.700> down<00:02:21.880> inside<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.480> filter<00:02:23.410> this

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
you look down inside this filter this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.590 
you look down inside this filter this
thing<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.610> down<00:02:24.760> here<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.300> impeller

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
thing right down here is the impeller

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.940 
thing right down here is the impeller
and<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.800> will<00:02:27.160> come<00:02:27.370> out<00:02:28.230> okay<00:02:29.230> give<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.770> gave

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and that will come out okay give it gave

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.440 
and that will come out okay give it gave
me<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.160> bit<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.370> trouble<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.360> it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
me a bit of trouble but this is what it

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.810 
me a bit of trouble but this is what it
looks<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.550> want<00:02:33.670> you

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
looks like and with this you want you

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.240 
looks like and with this you want you
want<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> clean<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.300> all<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.720> gunk<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:36.160> you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
want to clean up all this gunk there you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
want to clean up all this gunk there you
go<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:36.970> right<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:38.050> know

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
go you can see it right there you know

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.470 
go you can see it right there you know
clean<00:02:38.350> all<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.500> stuff<00:02:38.860> off<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.490> down

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
clean all that stuff off and down

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.220 
clean all that stuff off and down
underneath

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
underneath

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.890 
underneath
yeah<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:41.860> full<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.130> stuff<00:02:42.750> clean<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.870> that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
yeah that's full of stuff clean all that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.350 
yeah that's full of stuff clean all that
off<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.360> sit<00:02:46.510> in<00:02:46.630> there<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.310> then

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
off that can just sit in there and then

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.930 
off that can just sit in there and then
the<00:02:49.360> last<00:02:49.570> part<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.280> take<00:02:51.310> apart<00:02:51.610> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
the last part is to take apart the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.670 
the last part is to take apart the
energizer<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.810> comes<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.930> part<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
energizer it comes this part here is the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.110 
energizer it comes this part here is the
energizer<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.460> makes<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.940> whole<00:02:58.090> thing

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
energizer that makes the whole thing

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.650 
energizer that makes the whole thing
work<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:59.190> it<00:03:00.190> met<00:03:00.430> magnetically<00:03:01.300> interacts

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
work it's it met magnetically interacts

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.320 
work it's it met magnetically interacts
with<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.990> impeller<00:03:02.290> down<00:03:02.530> there<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:03.460> have<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
with the impeller down there to have the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.760 
with the impeller down there to have the
impeller<00:03:04.600> spin<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.110> that's<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:05.410> draws<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
impeller spin and that's what draws the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.370 
impeller spin and that's what draws the
water<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.190> into<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.550> filter<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.630> these

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
water up into the filter so these

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220 
water up into the filter so these
generally<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.870> tetra<00:03:10.870> whisperer

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
generally but this is a tetra whisperer

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.700 
generally but this is a tetra whisperer
jet<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:13.420> basically<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.230> grab<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.440> and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
jet and you basically just grab it and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.280 
jet and you basically just grab it and
twist<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.790> comes<00:03:16.000> off<00:03:16.180> here<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.260> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
twist it and it comes off here we see I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.320 
twist it and it comes off here we see I
already<00:03:17.770> twisted<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.520> needed<00:03:18.820> both<00:03:19.030> hand

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
already twisted it I needed both hand

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.100 
already twisted it I needed both hand
side<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.690> stop<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.900> video<00:03:20.230> but<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.080> a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
side to stop the video but it's got a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.400 
side to stop the video but it's got a
rubber<00:03:23.440> o-ring<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:24.010> keeps<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.900> keeps<00:03:25.900> seals

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
rubber o-ring that keeps it keeps seals

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.720 
rubber o-ring that keeps it keeps seals
the<00:03:26.530> water<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.130> water<00:03:27.160> doesn't<00:03:27.550> get

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
the water so the water doesn't get

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.540 
the water so the water doesn't get
everywhere<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.570> twist<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.550> it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
everywhere but you just twist it and it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.150 
everywhere but you just twist it and it
comes<00:03:30.940> out<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.390> then<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:32.500> part<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.010> don't

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
comes out and then this part you don't

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.220 
comes out and then this part you don't
want<00:03:33.430> getting<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> water<00:03:34.180> at<00:03:34.540> all<00:03:34.780> because

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
want getting in the water at all because

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.830 
want getting in the water at all because
it's<00:03:35.560> electrical<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.000> what<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.209> usually<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.690> is

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it's electrical so what I usually do is

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.750 
it's electrical so what I usually do is
just<00:03:37.870> pull<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.650> off<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.070> I'll<00:03:39.190> throw<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.550> big

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
just pull it off and I'll throw this big

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.910 
just pull it off and I'll throw this big
filter<00:03:40.150> part<00:03:40.300> in<00:03:40.510> there<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.780> clean<00:03:40.959> out<00:03:41.320> all

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
filter part in there and clean out all

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.470 
filter part in there and clean out all
the<00:03:42.070> junk<00:03:42.220> down<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.610> there<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.000> then<00:03:43.300> I'll<00:03:43.450> use

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
the junk down in there and then I'll use

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.350 
the junk down in there and then I'll use
a<00:03:43.690> q-tip<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.410> clean<00:03:44.800> down<00:03:45.190> inside<00:03:45.640> hey<00:03:45.940> I've

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
a q-tip and clean down inside hey I've

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.150 
a q-tip and clean down inside hey I've
got<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> Energizer<00:03:47.080> apart<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.709> as<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:48.010> can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
got the Energizer apart and as you can

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.280 
got the Energizer apart and as you can
see<00:03:48.340> that's<00:03:48.520> got<00:03:49.239> all<00:03:49.300> kinds<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.870> nasty<00:03:50.260> stuff

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
see that's got all kinds of nasty stuff

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.190

you<00:05:36.849> gotta<00:05:37.090> twist<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:38.610> so<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:40.750> start<00:05:41.020> off<00:05:41.139> I

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
you gotta twist it so you start off I

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.469 
you gotta twist it so you start off I
start<00:05:41.740> off<00:05:41.860> with<00:05:42.580> this<00:05:42.729> one<00:05:42.940> by<00:05:43.090> putting<00:05:43.240> it

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
start off with this one by putting it

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.200 
start off with this one by putting it
into<00:05:44.069> about<00:05:45.069> ninety<00:05:45.490> degrees<00:05:45.520> from<00:05:45.969> where<00:05:46.120> it

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
into about ninety degrees from where it

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.930 
into about ninety degrees from where it
needs<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:47.099> this<00:05:49.289> thingy<00:05:50.289> here<00:05:50.610> needs<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.819> be

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
needs this this thingy here needs to be

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.019 
needs this this thingy here needs to be
in<00:05:52.150> here<00:05:52.479> in<00:05:52.690> this<00:05:52.900> little<00:05:52.960> notch<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.639> push

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
in here in this little notch so I push

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.390 
in here in this little notch so I push
it<00:05:55.180> in<00:05:55.300> there<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.740> I'm<00:05:56.860> probably<00:05:57.069> not<00:05:57.279> going

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
it in there and I'm probably not going

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.559 
it in there and I'm probably not going
to<00:05:57.460> be<00:05:57.550> able<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.699> do<00:05:57.819> this<00:05:57.969> with<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.240> camera

to be able to do this with the camera

00:05:58.569 --> 00:05:59.790 
to be able to do this with the camera
because<00:05:58.719> I<00:05:58.779> need<00:05:58.930> two<00:05:59.110> hands<00:05:59.319> to<00:05:59.469> do<00:05:59.680> it

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
because I need two hands to do it

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.559 
because I need two hands to do it
because<00:05:59.979> it's<00:06:00.129> kind<00:06:00.759> of<00:06:00.909> hard<00:06:01.090> because<00:06:01.270> it's

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
because it's kind of hard because it's

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.029 
because it's kind of hard because it's
got<00:06:01.719> that<00:06:01.840> overhang<00:06:02.259> so<00:06:02.409> it<00:06:02.469> needs<00:06:02.650> to<00:06:02.740> seal

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
got that overhang so it needs to seal

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.519 
got that overhang so it needs to seal
but<00:06:03.879> anyhow<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:04.270> just<00:06:04.599> push<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:04.840> in<00:06:05.199> there

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
but anyhow you just push that in there

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:07.740 
but anyhow you just push that in there
and<00:06:06.009> twist<00:06:06.490> it<00:06:06.669> about<00:06:06.879> 90<00:06:07.180> degrees<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.690> it

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
and twist it about 90 degrees and it

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.409 
and twist it about 90 degrees and it
locks<00:06:07.990> into<00:06:08.199> place<00:06:08.289> and<00:06:08.830> then<00:06:09.610> after<00:06:09.940> that<00:06:10.060> you

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
locks into place and then after that you

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.980 
locks into place and then after that you
can<00:06:11.550> drop<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.789> your<00:06:12.969> impeller<00:06:13.419> with<00:06:13.810> the

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
can drop in your impeller with the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.760 
can drop in your impeller with the
impeller<00:06:14.379> up<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.159> the<00:06:15.490> magnet<00:06:15.879> down<00:06:16.770> right

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
impeller up and the magnet down right

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.140 
impeller up and the magnet down right
into<00:06:18.039> there<00:06:18.219> and<00:06:18.520> then<00:06:18.879> your<00:06:18.940> tube<00:06:21.150> pickup

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
into there and then your tube pickup

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.709 
into there and then your tube pickup
tube<00:06:22.360> goes<00:06:22.599> back<00:06:22.870> on<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:24.000> mm-hmm<00:06:25.889> that's<00:06:27.719> all

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
tube goes back on it mm-hmm that's all

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.959 
tube goes back on it mm-hmm that's all
you<00:06:28.840> have<00:06:29.020> to<00:06:29.169> do<00:06:29.400> then<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.520> just<00:06:30.699> put<00:06:30.879> it

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
you have to do then you just put it

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:32.490 
you have to do then you just put it
right<00:06:31.029> back<00:06:31.150> on<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.539> back<00:06:31.719> your<00:06:31.930> tank<00:06:32.229> and

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
right back on the back your tank and

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.439 
right back on the back your tank and
you'll<00:06:33.399> have<00:06:33.520> to<00:06:33.669> prime<00:06:33.909> it<00:06:33.940> when<00:06:34.210> you<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.389> to

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
you'll have to prime it when you go to

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.879 
you'll have to prime it when you go to
start<00:06:34.750> it<00:06:34.899> so<00:06:35.020> you'll<00:06:35.139> want<00:06:35.320> to<00:06:35.380> fill<00:06:35.560> it<00:06:35.740> with

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
start it so you'll want to fill it with

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:38.129 
start it so you'll want to fill it with
water<00:06:36.130> from<00:06:36.339> the<00:06:36.520> aquarium

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
water from the aquarium

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.570 
water from the aquarium
and<00:06:38.229> fill<00:06:39.159> up<00:06:39.280> both<00:06:39.460> sides<00:06:39.759> the<00:06:41.219> pick<00:06:42.219> up<00:06:42.370> side

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
and fill up both sides the pick up side

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.510 
and fill up both sides the pick up side
and<00:06:42.849> the<00:06:43.090> filter<00:06:43.449> side<00:06:43.689> and<00:06:44.349> then<00:06:44.889> plug<00:06:45.189> it<00:06:45.340> in

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
and the filter side and then plug it in

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.820 
and the filter side and then plug it in
and<00:06:45.789> at<00:06:45.999> that<00:06:46.180> point<00:06:46.419> just<00:06:46.900> monitor<00:06:47.499> it<00:06:47.650> and<00:06:47.740> it

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
and at that point just monitor it and it

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.409 
and at that point just monitor it and it
should<00:06:48.039> kick<00:06:48.430> on<00:06:48.610> by<00:06:48.789> itself<00:06:48.999> it<00:06:49.180> should<00:06:49.330> go

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
should kick on by itself it should go

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.480 
should kick on by itself it should go
ahead<00:06:49.539> and<00:06:49.659> it's<00:06:50.499> not<00:06:50.710> really<00:06:50.979> self<00:06:51.219> priming

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
ahead and it's not really self priming

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.149 
ahead and it's not really self priming
but<00:06:51.909> it<00:06:52.210> will<00:06:52.509> after<00:06:53.050> you<00:06:53.409> put<00:06:53.590> water<00:06:53.770> in<00:06:54.009> there

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
but it will after you put water in there

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.689 
but it will after you put water in there
it<00:06:54.340> should<00:06:54.370> just<00:06:54.789> pick<00:06:54.969> up<00:06:55.150> and<00:06:56.249> start<00:06:57.249> working

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
it should just pick up and start working

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.640 
it should just pick up and start working
again<00:06:57.849> and<00:06:58.360> hopefully<00:06:58.569> much<00:06:58.990> better<00:06:59.259> now<00:06:59.469> that
