00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
problem will another since in the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.679 
problem will another since in the
beginning<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.880> tournament<00:01:17.270> type<00:01:17.420> I

with Iranian and then you know in the
end<00:01:24.080> i<00:01:24.710> would<00:01:24.950> say<00:01:25.130> probably<00:01:25.539> i<00:01:27.340> wasn't<00:01:28.340> even

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369

against Chris choke so I cannot really
complain<00:01:35.360> but<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.899> slept<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.470> feeling<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.920> I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
complain but I slept the feeling that I

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.840 
complain but I slept the feeling that I
needed<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.039> work<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.220> bit<00:01:40.399> harder<00:01:40.459> in<00:01:40.759> the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
needed to work a bit harder in the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.899 
needed to work a bit harder in the
beginning

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
beginning

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.190 
beginning
I<00:01:44.819> don't<00:01:45.819> really<00:01:45.969> like<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.780> make<00:01:46.869> assessments

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
I don't really like to make assessments

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.080 
I don't really like to make assessments
during<00:01:47.679> government<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.399> think<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:48.729> better<00:01:48.880> to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
during government I think it's better to

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.779 
during government I think it's better to
leave<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.329> afterwards<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.679> I'm<00:01:51.340> playing<00:01:51.520> from

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
leave it afterwards but I'm playing from

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.209 
leave it afterwards but I'm playing from
game<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:51.969> game<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.569> it's<00:01:52.659> going<00:01:52.840> okay<00:01:53.219> no

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
game to game and it's going okay no

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.699 
game to game and it's going okay no
obviously<00:01:54.460> was<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.819> good<00:01:54.969> result<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
obviously was a good result in the

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.279 
obviously was a good result in the
morning<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:59.459> once<00:02:00.459> I<00:02:00.789> got<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:02.020> was<00:02:02.140> very

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
morning basically once I got it was very

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.569 
morning basically once I got it was very
difficult<00:02:02.469> because<00:02:02.679> lack<00:02:03.039> is<00:02:03.189> always<00:02:03.459> very

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
difficult because lack is always very

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.300 
difficult because lack is always very
close<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.179> equalising<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.200> i<00:02:05.439> think<00:02:06.189> when<00:02:06.280> i

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
close to equalising but i think when i

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.219 
close to equalising but i think when i
played<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.609> 4<00:02:06.939> and<00:02:07.119> d5<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.539> once<00:02:07.840> five-pound

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
played a 4 and d5 and once five-pound

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.919 
played a 4 and d5 and once five-pound
went<00:02:08.379> to<00:02:08.470> d6<00:02:08.769> then<00:02:08.979> i<00:02:09.099> felt<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.429> all<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
went to d6 then i felt that all the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.900 
went to d6 then i felt that all the
lines<00:02:11.110> should<00:02:11.319> favor<00:02:11.590> white<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.549> looks<00:02:12.580> like<00:02:12.879> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
lines should favor white it looks like a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.460 
lines should favor white it looks like a
Grunfeld<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:13.690> way<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:13.930> queen<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.260> sitting

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
Grunfeld but one way my queen is sitting

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.580 
Grunfeld but one way my queen is sitting
on<00:02:14.530> f6<00:02:14.799> on<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:16.090> second<00:02:16.450> game<00:02:16.629> I<00:02:17.349> think

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
on f6 on and the second game I think

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.550 
on f6 on and the second game I think
well<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:19.420> did<00:02:19.569> something<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.079> opening<00:02:20.379> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
well we did something in the opening and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.940 
well we did something in the opening and
suddenly<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.220> transpose<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.560> Queen<00:02:23.560> c2d

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
suddenly we transpose to the Queen c2d

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.490 
suddenly we transpose to the Queen c2d
five<00:02:24.160> lines<00:02:24.690> which<00:02:25.690> were<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:25.959> popular<00:02:26.170> some

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
five lines which were very popular some

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.880 
five lines which were very popular some
time<00:02:27.190> ago<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.090> guess<00:02:28.420> still<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.709> where<00:02:29.860> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
time ago and I guess still but where I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.490 
time ago and I guess still but where I
have<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.400> possibility<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.150> play<00:02:31.360> 97<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:31.989> 796

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
have the possibility to play 97 in 796

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.960 
have the possibility to play 97 in 796
so<00:02:32.829> it<00:02:32.920> seems<00:02:33.129> that<00:02:33.280> white<00:02:33.459> has<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.730> try<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so it seems that white has to try to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.390 
so it seems that white has to try to
equalize<00:02:34.239> witchy<00:02:35.140> modulus<00:02:35.530> am<00:02:35.980> us<00:02:36.099> we<00:02:36.250> had<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
equalize witchy modulus am us we had to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.979 
equalize witchy modulus am us we had to
do<00:02:36.609> and<00:02:36.819> he<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.150> equalized<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
do and he just equalized and in the

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.839 
do and he just equalized and in the
final<00:02:38.140> position<00:02:38.650> there<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.069> no<00:02:39.220> some<00:02:39.519> chance

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
final position there is no some chance

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.940 
final position there is no some chance
maybe<00:02:40.269> we<00:02:40.420> screw<00:02:40.599> net<00:02:40.720> ID<00:02:40.870> checks<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.440> stuff

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
maybe we screw net ID checks and stuff

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.770 
maybe we screw net ID checks and stuff
like<00:02:42.099> this<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.519> didn't<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.299> mean<00:02:43.510> queen

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
like this I didn't see it I mean queen

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.759 
like this I didn't see it I mean queen
if<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.079> checked<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:45.129> bishop<00:02:45.400> t2<00:02:46.079> Queen<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.319> 6

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
if I checked just bishop t2 Queen a 6

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.030 
if I checked just bishop t2 Queen a 6
for<00:02:48.340> instance<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.090> then<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:50.799> Queen<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
for instance and then know if Queen a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.330 
for instance and then know if Queen a
paycheck<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.609> will<00:02:51.819> decided<00:02:52.209> before<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:53.440> mean

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
paycheck we will decided before I mean

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.449 
paycheck we will decided before I mean
after<00:02:54.760> before<00:02:55.269> white<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.840> never<00:02:55.989> be<00:02:56.459> better

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
after before white can never be better

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.610 
after before white can never be better
because<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.359> always<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> c-4<00:02:59.169> square<00:02:59.410> but

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
because I always have the c-4 square but

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020 
because I always have the c-4 square but
neither<00:03:00.130> can<00:03:00.400> black<00:03:00.519> be<00:03:00.669> better<00:03:00.819> because

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
neither can black be better because

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.250 
neither can black be better because
white<00:03:01.269> look<00:03:01.389> like<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.569> should<00:03:01.720> be<00:03:01.810> true<00:03:01.989> so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
white look like we should be true so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.510 
white look like we should be true so
small<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.980> strong

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.350 

I<00:03:07.610> think<00:03:08.610> since<00:03:10.940> kamsky<00:03:11.940> took<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.210> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
I think since kamsky took all of it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.240 
I think since kamsky took all of it
already<00:03:12.810> been<00:03:13.020> postponed<00:03:13.470> by<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> few<00:03:13.980> months

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
already been postponed by a few months

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.330 
already been postponed by a few months
it<00:03:14.880> was<00:03:15.120> quite<00:03:15.690> logical<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.350> our<00:03:16.920> match<00:03:17.160> had

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
it was quite logical that our match had

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.090 
it was quite logical that our match had
to<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.490> postponed<00:03:17.880> as<00:03:18.000> well<00:03:18.470> otherwise<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
to be postponed as well otherwise if a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.010 
to be postponed as well otherwise if a
match<00:03:20.250> finishes<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.760> February<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:21.840> I

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
match finishes in February and then I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.120 
match finishes in February and then I
have<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> play<00:03:22.740> in<00:03:22.800> September

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
have we have to play in September

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
have we have to play in September
there's<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.430> no<00:03:23.520> time<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.360> do<00:03:24.450> any<00:03:24.570> proper

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
there's just no time to do any proper

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
there's just no time to do any proper
work<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.800> no<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> think<00:03:26.520> it's<00:03:26.760> quite<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> logical

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
work so no I think it's quite a logical

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.510 
work so no I think it's quite a logical
decision<00:03:27.900> big<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.800> not<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> big<00:03:29.130> secret<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
decision big it's not a big secret that

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.810 
decision big it's not a big secret that
nowadays<00:03:30.120> being<00:03:31.110> young<00:03:31.320> helps<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.800> chess<00:03:32.010> but

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
nowadays being young helps in chess but

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.160 
nowadays being young helps in chess but
I<00:03:33.210> don't<00:03:33.510> think<00:03:33.570> there's<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.840> big<00:03:33.990> difference

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
I don't think there's a big difference

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.620 
I don't think there's a big difference
between<00:03:34.470> being<00:03:34.680> 40<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.460> being<00:03:35.790> 39<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> few

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
between being 40 and being 39 and a few

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.770 
between being 40 and being 39 and a few
months<00:03:37.070> let's<00:03:38.070> put<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.340> way<00:03:38.480> if<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.630> could

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
months let's put it that way if I could

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.240 
months let's put it that way if I could
be<00:03:39.870> 25<00:03:40.260> again<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.680> would<00:03:40.800> be<00:03:40.890> something<00:03:41.040> else

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
be 25 again this would be something else

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.400 
be 25 again this would be something else
but<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:43.340> understand<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:45.810> general<00:03:46.020> as<00:03:46.290> you

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
but I understand that in general as you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.040 
but I understand that in general as you
get<00:03:46.530> older<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.890> more<00:03:47.040> difficult<00:03:47.160> but<00:03:47.870> I'm<00:03:48.870> also

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
get older is more difficult but I'm also

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.480 
get older is more difficult but I'm also
having<00:03:49.260> some<00:03:49.530> good<00:03:49.680> results<00:03:49.800> in<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.160> last<00:03:50.340> few

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
having some good results in the last few

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.660 
having some good results in the last few
years<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:54.830> will<00:03:55.830> keep<00:03:55.980> working<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.520> try

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
years so and I will keep working and try

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.620 
years so and I will keep working and try
my<00:03:56.700> best<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.210> can<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.390> say

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.350 

I<00:04:01.990> mean<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.890> was<00:04:04.070> mainly<00:04:04.310> interesting<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.120> I

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
I mean it was mainly interesting that I

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.270 
I mean it was mainly interesting that I
I<00:04:05.990> think<00:04:06.470> most<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.710> you<00:04:06.800> might<00:04:06.980> just<00:04:07.130> get

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
I think most of you might just get

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.840 
I think most of you might just get
decided<00:04:07.670> by<00:04:07.790> nerves<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:09.250> mean<00:04:10.250> I'd<00:04:10.370> expected

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
decided by nerves I mean I'd expected

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.380 
decided by nerves I mean I'd expected
gottas<00:04:11.390> knobs<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.840> be<00:04:12.020> much<00:04:12.170> thing<00:04:13.070> but<00:04:13.390> it's

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
gottas knobs to be much thing but it's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.040 
gottas knobs to be much thing but it's
clear<00:04:14.660> with<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.500> tension<00:04:15.860> nowadays<00:04:16.220> anybody

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050
