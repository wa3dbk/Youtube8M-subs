00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 the same 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.330
 Mister President 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.689
 your European voluntarism 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.899
 your ambition for europe 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.239
 and such challenge 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.169
 that we will see them European we share 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.689
 and I'll even paraphrase a song 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.990
 that you know 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.210
 it's a drug we share 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.449
 so I would like to say one thing 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.079
 a thing 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.269
 if the ambition 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.200
 two dealers 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.310
 she that the climate pack 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.830
 we must accept it as it is 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.840
 and that the next sentence is to kneel in front of the bible 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.940
 of the German automotive industry 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 we did not call to vote 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 because all the others will come years and they will go too 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750
 here's the problem 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 we reached our part 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.330
 we can not today 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.640
 screaming mom because gas is too expensive and not forcing industry 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.440
 automotive 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 to build cars 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.430
 which consumes only 2 3 liters it's been 15 years since it's possible because it 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 there is no rule that requires them 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.790
 that of consumers who pay on Monday 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.870
 the essence at the price where it is here the truth is it must be said here are the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.560
 things as they are 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.880
 you talk about the immigration park 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.480
 banco on the not of immigration 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.190
 then flown the device by gateway 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.079
 because for legal migration 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.479
 the european parliament is still decision yet the elysee having 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.180
 a real political debate 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.330
 a real debate for democratic debate because I brought back to acer 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.609
 because every time we talk about migration 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.259
 after fifteen seconds in vf of olot not 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.479
 illegal immigration 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.009
 from the low hand of emigration let's first say that if europe as it 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.150
 exists today it is thanks to the men and women of immigration 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.000
 which is the proof yes with us here is the truth 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.910
 and after 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.010
 I'm fine I'm not without genius but we built a 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.090
 house we forgot the jarawa doors by the window i tell you 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.200
 let's build together first 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.010
 the doors to enter europe and after we'll see what we'll do 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.140
 of those who will enter illegally you tell us it takes qualified 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.290
 and at the same time europe buys at home every year more than dozens 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.329
 of the thousands of students who informed him that he is sending home 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.879
 soils to live here if they did their education 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.839
 this time no remote control 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:37.729
 continuing now that on things we had told you 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.400
 Let's go 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.379
 of europe on the social 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.219
 Mister President 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.210
 you would not protect 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.489
 Europeans 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 if we do not tackle this 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.190
 at the social dome ping the tax authorities 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.110
 we must ask this problem 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.519
 we are European we must stop alas 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.080
 we are first loaned it is necessary to discuss with the central bank 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.340
 discussing it is necessary to discuss as soon as possible 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.489
 arguing but we do not accept more than ten years 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 social side 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.790
 9a part b not part of European competences we can not continue 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 like that 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.119
 to tell them now 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.809
 around her that divides us deeply 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.869
 you will eat with chopsticks 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.469
 with the President of China to open the Olympic Games 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.919
 Enjoy your meal 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.409
 I think reindeer 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.000
 to all the prisoners who are languishing in private prisons in Chinese 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.169
 I will think 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.829
 to all those who are arrested 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.150
 I will think of all those who are mistreated in tibet 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.320
 and I tell you 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.330
 you had the opportunity for one hour three dead to defend values ​​a 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.080
 recalled m 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.340
 of democracy and freedom 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.300
 in ten years I do not participate in the opening of the games to the masquerade of 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.510
 Chinese Communist Party this year is driving 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.269
 and I tell you 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.289
 I tell you okay to enlighten your memories 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.400
 that's why no head you did 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.450
 why can be it is because you will see that those who compete country 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.460
 in the present 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.430
 he of the euro he laments world not what wish to put them in jail diaw 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.960

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.600
 markets
