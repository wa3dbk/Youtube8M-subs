00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 but I wanted to give this informs 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.620
 explain why these people of the 90 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 years make fun of those who 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 they do the feeding efforts 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.240
 I would not say unnecessary vegan vegetarian 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.490
 but because they are rightly born as 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.859
 he used to say at a time when food 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 fuck there were few see that pig 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 he knows what lot of was killed 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 December and in one family lasted one 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 year therefore practically there was more 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.290
 he was bred with plant foods of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 kitchen scraps etc. 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 and then he ate small amounts of it 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.890
 during the festivals the agnolin of the festival 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 that the things there that is true then 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 more these people have been 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.800
 programmed in during their 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.079
 pregnancy these are very recent data 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.430
 we have 19,000 active genes there 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.170
 they are much more but those that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 they work let's take an example 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 these genes work by turning on and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.170
 dying 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 thanks to a programming done 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.189
 during pregnancy 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 let's take the example of the cancer that it is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.009
 the one we're losing now 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.229
 battle because it increases more and more 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.820
 if during pregnancy the woman eats 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.140
 correctly and above all not 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.939
 takes poisons inside the greater 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 part of the food but above all 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.009
 animal foods for these woodwind principals 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.619
 they melt where there is fat and there it is 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.479
 they accumulate and therefore there is no plants 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 fat especially in the puts them 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.000
 animals if the woman takes poisons 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 programming during pregnancy 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.159
 of the genes we make an example the gene that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.560
 controls cancer cells la 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.479
 proliferation are called 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.149
 WHO does what it does if it is 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 programmed well when it notices 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 some cells are going towards the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.570
 malice turns on and gives 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.180
 indications to everything to the systems for 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.580
 eliminate them and then quiet down 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.790
 but if there is not during pregnancy 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.990
 It was a programming because it is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.260
 ate badly with poisons that alter i 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.890
 genes themselves alter this non gene 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
 it works 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.310
 and then you have to work every day 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.750
 an unplanned person during the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.370
 property must be careful 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.130
 he has no protection every day 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.620
 effective if not the daily one of 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.709
 eliminate poisons as much as possible 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 environmental issues with a diet that 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.050
 reduce as much as we can say foods 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.510
 which contain fats 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.330
 this is a very very important thing 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.360
 so you are absolutely right 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.350
 so much so that there is data on the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.920
 Italian woman in 2004 became ill of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:05.100
 serious illnesses at the age of 71 in 2012 at 61 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.170
 has lost ten years of healthy living e 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.650
 the man has lost six are none 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.239
 these data are published on the internet 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.010
 sent by the Ministry of Health to 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.549
 European community like everyone else 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.370
 countries but no one advertised them not 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.060
 it is talked about because it ends 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.890
 about what she said about illnesses 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.370
 the most important are all the most serious ones 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.380
 and derive from a diet that is not 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.200
 only excess animal feed 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.920
 compared to a past but excess of 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.500
 animal foods whose fat is 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.780
 contains all we say most 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.540
 dioxins pesticide poisons yielded to 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.400
 finish them off and eat them if you take them 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.959
 they end up in his fat and then at a 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.060
 some point they go around giving 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.660
 the inflammation that brings all ste 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.519
 illnesses 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.590
 this is the big problem today 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.940
 because it is an increase in people yes 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.310
 sick of diseases 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.150
 for this reason I am not there for nothing else 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.860
 other explanations 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.410
 but this would mean the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.870
 revolution the field revolution 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.090
 food then give gods 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 big problems are the real review 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.720
 all the system feeds 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.450
 which no one wants to do for which 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.090
 touch ministry and thinking minds e 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.820
 she told the ministry there are gods 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.530
 veterinarians in charge of the ministry of 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.010
 health that make the beautiful and bad 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.340
 time in agreement with industrial companies 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.620
 meats for example affect the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.850
 There are so many school catering 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.770
 others in some regions at the head of 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.560
 food hygiene and nutrition services there 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.360
 these are veterinarians 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.980
 politically there is therefore always return 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.570
 there is a money not money problem 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.480
 they don't care about people if they do 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.460
 what is important is that this 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.880
 system go ahead what they prescribe 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.040
 drugs that can be tested, etc. 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.680
 this is very serious while instead 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.510
 starting with an education at the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.350
 health and above all on nutrition 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.810
 you could live healthy the example is 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.540
 these gentlemen 90 years old people who are 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.669
 well-planned states that don't care 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.280
 because they have the genes that defend them 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.350
 daily thing that of children of 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.729
 today they cannot do that anyone 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.950
 teaches the mother to eat in a way 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.080
 correct and defend themselves from these 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.910
 situations 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.900
 if I can I wanted to make two small ones 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.169
 additions if we then hear them but they are 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.530
 very short 1 and professor pinelli who has 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.220
 said that women get ten 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.560
 years ago 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.720
 and this is not advertised but 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.850
 is very well publicized that the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.400
 life expectancy is always longer than 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.340
 plus the problem we need to address 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.100
 quality of life problem 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:00.900
 how to arrive at the end of life 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:05.520
 with what dignity with what dignity 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.310
 a man's life ends 25 kg 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.590
 destroyed by toxic drugs that do not 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.940
 they never ever solved theirs 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.940
 problem in the root 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.260
 I talk about it in one of the chapters and its own 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.350
 derivative on this on chemotherapy and 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.390
 then I just wanted this at the end 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.940
 Of the war 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:30.810
 the second great war for sure 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.310
 died of hunger there was so much poverty but 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.850
 statistics tell us that the rate of 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.910
 disease had collapsed means that 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.360
 when in that situation surely 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.780
 of impoverishment of substances in the sense 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.790
 to live etc. but there was little to 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:57.870
 eating the food was not altered and there 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:01.290
 he helped each other between human beings 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.890
 not like today that we all walk with 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.560
 knives against each other armed that 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.440
 we helped each other so there was the core 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.060
 hard of this humanity was to help themselves there 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.310
 where a family did not come there could 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.470
 think of the other children when not there 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.970
 could breastfeed a mother for various 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.030
 reasons for nursing the mother of others 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:25.650
 this today would be seen as a thing 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:26.760
 hideous obscene let's go into the 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.680
 future 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.930
 thinking back to our past and it is not 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.740
 conspiracy is absolutely not 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:37.650
 conspiracy the trying to plant well 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.230
 on the ground and our essence of beings 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.580
 human because someone does not want us anymore 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.580
 so much human
