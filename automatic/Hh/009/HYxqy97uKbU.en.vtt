see incorrectly onto the first floor I

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420 
see incorrectly onto the first floor I
actually<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:55.950> landing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

a<00:02:06.270> better<00:02:06.509> way<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:08.509> rounding<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
a better way of actually rounding or I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.220 
a better way of actually rounding or I
guess<00:02:10.730> doing<00:02:11.730> modular<00:02:12.330> buildings<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:12.900> round

please<00:02:20.430> let<00:02:20.670> me<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.120> landing<00:02:22.080> area<00:02:22.849> it

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
please let me know the landing area it

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.410 
please let me know the landing area it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
structural integrity it needs it seems

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.039 
structural integrity it needs it seems
but<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.640> don't<00:02:30.150> think<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> most<00:02:30.599> elegant

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
but I don't think it's the most elegant

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.809 
but I don't think it's the most elegant
solution<00:02:36.290> second<00:02:37.290> floor

pretty<00:02:38.819> straightforward<00:02:39.349> again<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.620> seats<00:02:41.040> in

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
pretty straightforward again it seats in

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.940 
pretty straightforward again it seats in
and<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> landing<00:02:42.569> area<00:02:42.870> part<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and because a landing area part of it is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
and because a landing area part of it is
actually<00:02:44.430> raised<00:02:45.180> slightly<00:02:45.870> above<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.170> rest

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
actually raised slightly above the rest

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
actually raised slightly above the rest
and<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.099> allows<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.519> seat<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:48.030> easily<00:02:48.269> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and it allows the seat really easily and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.869 
and it allows the seat really easily and
to<00:02:48.660> click<00:02:49.260> right<00:02:49.470> into<00:02:49.590> place<00:02:49.769> secure<00:02:50.340> down

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.069 

I'm<00:02:53.879> actually<00:02:54.510> doing<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:56.750> outwards<00:02:57.750> towards

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I'm actually doing it outwards towards

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.089 
I'm actually doing it outwards towards
the<00:02:58.290> exterior<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.489> building<00:02:59.519> rather<00:03:00.120> than

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
the exterior of the building rather than

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.539 
the exterior of the building rather than
making<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:03.560> inclined<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.890> with<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.220> building

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
making it inclined in with the building

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.229 
making it inclined in with the building
it's<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.180> up<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.340> tower<00:03:08.549> will<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
it's going up so the tower will get it a

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.140 
it's going up so the tower will get it a
little<00:03:09.420> bit<00:03:11.450> facing<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.910> without

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
little bit facing like that but without

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.039 
little bit facing like that but without
the<00:03:15.269> leaning<00:03:15.569> hopefully<00:03:16.430> yep<00:03:17.430> that's<00:03:18.239> all<00:03:18.480> if

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
the leaning hopefully yep that's all if

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.199 
the leaning hopefully yep that's all if
you<00:03:19.109> liked<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.349> let<00:03:19.889> me<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.459> think<00:03:21.060> I'm

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
you liked it let me know I think I'm

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.550 
you liked it let me know I think I'm
going<00:03:21.389> in<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.569> right<00:03:21.599> direction<00:03:21.810> if<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:22.470> have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
going in the right direction if you have

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.319 
going in the right direction if you have
some<00:03:22.799> constructive<00:03:23.220> feedback<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.910> would<00:03:24.150> love

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
some constructive feedback I would love

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.269 
some constructive feedback I would love
to<00:03:24.450> hear<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:25.130> as<00:03:26.130> well<00:03:26.269> thanks
