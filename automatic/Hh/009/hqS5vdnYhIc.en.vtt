00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.510

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.320

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.320

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 in a bowl we are going to put 150 milliliters 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.250
 of sunflower oil not oil 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.590
 vegetable because the forgiveness of oil 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.410
 extra virgin because it's going to have a taste 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.410
 very strong and we are going to add 2 eggs 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.790
 let's leave it 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 in a bowl we have 100 200 grams of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.200
 flour a tablespoon of baking 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.520
 a teaspoon of cinnamon we're going to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520
 mix everything 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.940
 we go down a bit and we're going to add 150 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.670
 grams of grated carrots are about 3 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.390
 medium 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 let's go 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 we go 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:13.140
 always the most optional end you can 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.810
 put nuts 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.390
 I put a little bit again but in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.680
 I'm not going to put it because I do not 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.680
 everyone likes nuts 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.200
 do you think you're going to listen to my little 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.540
 possible who also leave 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.010
 and we're going to add it in the three molds 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.769
 rooms 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.230
 and we put the oven to 170 and we're going to 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.980
 add inside in the oven 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.519
 for 20 minutes 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 or when you see that everything is done Moscow 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.700
 what 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.200
 good are 12 and in the oven to 170 for 20 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.930
 minutes 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.769
 they have already left the oven they have been 20 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.269
 minutes in the oven to 180 what I've 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.120
 fact is to put a toothpick inside to 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.970
 see if they were made but they are all 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.500
 ok and let's start with the frosting 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.380
 which is cheese 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.769
 we started with 75 grams of butter and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.769
 we are going 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.440
 good 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.380
 and in a bowl we have 275 grams of sugar 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:48.260
 glas and what I 'm going to do is mix it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.650
 medium inside the butter and 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.650
 we mix 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.150
 when we have already mixed the icing sugar 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.640
 with butter you see that it is not so 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.340
 creamy but it's important to do this 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:16.049
 step and we're going to add that 125 grams of 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.130
 cheese that this brand of 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.890
 mercadona 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.760
 you can take the carrefour market or 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.580
 philadelphia 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.139
 at 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.900
 that is creamy that is very dense os 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.419
 you were going to mix 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.740
 and what about then we already mix the 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.740
 icing sugar with greater 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.070
 we take a pastry bag I lame 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.950
 you can throw away the ones you have 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.540
 at home to any rope you want and 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.730
 this is a star has open in the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.240
 that again I always like 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.419
 decorate the cupcakes 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.790
 and we are going to put the mass if you see what 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.070
 creamy and white is 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.160
 this is the typical one that you can use when 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.940
 you make the velvet net that I also have 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.940
 much 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.070
 but 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.600
 we have put everything in the sleeve we give some 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.880
 turns to the rival 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:44.560
 and what I normally choose 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.560
 down to help 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.289
 and it is already that way 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.169
 you can not 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:23.370
 well here next to the end are for me 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.430

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.430
 same 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.630
 you do not have that sweet as some 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.300
 coquetes but this one inside has with 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.660
 the cream of cheese and everything gives that touch 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:42.880
 sweet but not as much as others like 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.660
