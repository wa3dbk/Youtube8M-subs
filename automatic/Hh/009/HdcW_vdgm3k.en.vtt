00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.840
 from December 13, 2014 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.560
 Agribusiness companies 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.859
 must respect the new regulation 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 1169 2011 says the regulation a co ce 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.920
 regulation governs the information of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.840
 consumers on commodities 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 food 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.199
 it is the fruit of three years of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 discussions and laid to the repeal and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 the merging of many texts into 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.309
 particular directives are merged 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 the 2013 Directive on 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.309
 labeling of foodstuffs in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.399
 General and Directive 90 496 on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 to nutrition labeling the regulation 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.640
 aco concerns all commodities 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.829
 processed or unprocessed 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.719
 pre-packaged or not, including 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.920
 food served in restoration 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.660
 collective 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.699
 the major innovation of this regulation is 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.039
 linked to the obligation for foodstuffs 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.350
 prepackaged foods to display a 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.940
 nutrition declaration 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 two other measures are also 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.939
 emphasize regarding readability a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 minimum character size is fixed 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.479
 concerning the labeling of the origin 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 mention is extended to new 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.030
 products and in some cases to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030
 the primary ingredient 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.329
 currently monday breaks 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.759
 country of origin or place of origin 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.210
 is mandatory for fruits and vegetables 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.850
 vegetables 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.159
 honey olive oil and meat 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.439
 cattle following in particular the candidates of 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.640
 mad cow disease this 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.009
 mention will be from December 13, 2014 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.990
 obligatory for pigmeat 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.729
 sheep goat as well as for meat 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.619
 fresh poultry 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.539
 frozen or chilled 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.880
 it is already possible to buy 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.280
 ham stamped with pork 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.319
 French 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.239
 another new fact when the origin of 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.090
 the primary ingredient of the commodity is 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.799
 different from that of the labeled product 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.329
 the manufacturer must indicate it by specifying 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.340
 that this ingredient comes from a 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.950
 different origin or giving it the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.869
 exact provenance for example in the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.720
 case of chicken nuggets it will be 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.819
 conceivable to describe it nuggets manufactured 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.819
 in France with Spanish chicken 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.980
 the mandatory information must have 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.540
 a minimum size of 1.2 mm except for 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.280
 packaging the most 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.830
 large at a surface less than or equal 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 at 80 square centimeters in this case the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.200
 minimum size is 0.9 mm 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 the obligation of a display 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.840
 nutrition is a consequence of 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.760
 White Paper of May 30, 2007 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.510
 European Commission on Nutrition 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.069
 overweight and obesity 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 to partially address these issues 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 major public health 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.849
 member states voted in favor 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.549
 a text that improves information 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.599
 on nutritional characteristics 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.510
 the nutritional display will have to 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.489
 integrate the energy value as well as 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.980
 the amounts of fatty acids fats 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.150
 saturated with carbohydrate proteins 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 sugars and salt 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.230
 these data will be obligatorily 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.380
 display in the same field of view 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.560
 in a precise order and expressed for 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.730
 100 g or 100 milliliters 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.379
 lack of sufficient places on 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.239
 packing the information 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.340
 nutritional data can be presented 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.970
 in linear form instead of the array 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.150
 conventional European regulation 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.730
 number 1169 2011 serves the interests of the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.069
 consumer with labeling 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 harmonized simplified and transparent 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.720
 allowing an informed choice the setting 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.489
 nutritional display application 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.609
 may incur expenses 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.420
 of industrialists because of 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.680
 further analysis to be expected 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.480
 given the new mentions 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.060
 mandatory and the change of the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.810
 minimum height of characters 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.829
 labeling of a large number of 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.829
 products is to be renewed
