 have people today we end up 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.830
 for a little tutorial on the plugin 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.210
 I forgot mannerist light 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.460
 today we are coming to teach you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.950
 how real automatic enemies with 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 mind the light 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 that's all that you 're going to tap on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.010
 google 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.010
 miles is from option kits 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.789
 I wanted to find or on the link 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.610
 several mind 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.650
 despite its size rules that it's 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.989
 tone like that for small files 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.460
 latest version so they were marking 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.610
 moissac but it works between auxerre 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.420
 since this folds this tutorial 1.37 you open 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.650
 you save once it 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.330
 save you put it in your 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.379
 plugin file of your knowledge and there 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.379
 you have on your server 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.190
 the mouth 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 if you do that plugin the fhp has 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.950
 hitched or what we will do is shoot 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.970
 vol lahoud loose surface paul there is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 nine bay in malines result has here then 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 already to start it takes a ton 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.750
 so I selected an area 15 of 15 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.180
 out of ten two authors you had 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.450
 sectioned the area 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:39.090
 oh yes I forgot something he had 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 also download the plugin world dp 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.330
 world elite small finally I put you the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 link in the description of course and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.179
 you download the latest to his game 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.190
 you show tejada the invention that to 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.259
 1.6 but hey his sleeve how this water 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.340
 if you download and there you open this 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030
 because it sucks wii black and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.550
 you put this jar point folder in 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.000
 your plugin folder again there 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 for example the enemy here that's it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.290
 to be able to cut donkeys 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.410
 here you have to download 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.880
 select your young with with a 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.700
 ax so right click 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.260
 so I have already made announcements to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 new york and fiat amp proposal 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.829
 first position and left click 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.660
 second position here is the gesture 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.900
 section the area so from here I collaborate 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.030
 in water and this square section like that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.120
 now you're doing the chain 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.060
 is real clegg the name so I'm typing 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.110
 the mines 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.950
 yes done task after we can all the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.750
 commandos makes the chain is real that's it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.410
 to see all all 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.530
 stone mines maurel prom let go 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.790
 Mereiles list we see that the daÃ¯ra 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.740
 mines is there so we'll start m 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.050
 you see if I do 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.220
 this hmr l iset mines so mrl so that's 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.890
 it's for all the orders of the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.130
 risette plugin is what we want 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.200
 make 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.340
 so I want to risk the mine and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.310
 mines it's the nov 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.890
 that's where you see if I laugh her 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.390
 room to remove is because in fact 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.950
 that selected all do not worry 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.400
 select the area except that there 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.650
 you see one say there is no 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.360
 only air to the info mind there is 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.130
 nothing at all nothing at all 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 so we'll see how to put 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.480
 compositions so forgiveness that I you 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.950
 showed slash amerell so for the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.950
 command this is it generates l 7 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 no mine the composition so I 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.110
 will test I showed you with a 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.030
 so that ashton and the percentage 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.690
 the percentage we will put 100 % in view 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.319
 to protest 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.150
 that's it and so here if we do a little 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.000
 are you is that the SITL 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.780
 because I put 100% but good I 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.930
 can not put at 100% I'll put to 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:13.099
 psg will put in the 80% coming 85% this 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.140
 wave 4 1% it's good for them for 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.829
 mini public that's if you make a 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.079
 visual you will do you type a if 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.720
 often hollows because there is 80% of 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.270
 Space taken from Aston so we go 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.810
 put a little bit of everything just for 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.110
 example 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.110
 here 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.789
 so then to get the idea of blocks 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.280
 that's enough of course since on f3 more 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.669
 tasks at the same time and you have the idea 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.620
 there I removed it so the basic application 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.129
 you do not have anything to mark if you are f3 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:55.569
 pistachio there you have the idea marked on 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:56.840
 the donation here is the lidc 56 so 56 to 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.599
 5% 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.599
 this is after 14 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.330
 15 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.510
 and there we will put coal felt 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.020
 that's nothing too perhaps 4% 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.020
 here 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:34.300
 I do that because it's 80 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:38.100
 succeed the most no no 84,7 and 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.100
 regular glnf 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.830
 we're going to put it at 5 years old and then comes here if 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.430
 we do 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.470
 for the reset if we stay the mine 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:56.590
 that's where you already see you have a 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:59.650
 not bad mine you have one like that but 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.080
 one thing is that good if someone who 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.240
 arrive him into you mean to and half everything 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.789
 there is nothing for the others and in fact 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.650
 you want that cherry is once 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.229
 every 5 minutes or 10 minutes 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.789
 how to fly is simple for 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.090
 that's going to have to do that and 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.090
 Mereiles 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:25.160
 flag after no mine and comines 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.860
 risette therefore a deadline for 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.430
 risettes alas the figure is going to be 20 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.410
 minutes so five minutes hop here so 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.480
 I put eight minutes of art - eidos reset 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.860
 not very long 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.510
 I do not really want to wait 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.120
 I hope you trust me 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.790
 these voices there but so here's 100 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.860
 minutes it would be it is a little bit 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.840
 All the time 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.400
 after how there are plenty but 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.150
 that's the most important thing when he 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:01.480
 is automatic and to put a 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:03.950
 certain amount of 2.10 of the two blocks 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.320
 So here me is there are several 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.000
 time there are plugins to be able 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.550
 the automatic mines but that one 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.110
 it's the best finally me it's the only one 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.540
 which I know but here are sailboats of the 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.040
 series 7 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.460
 I talked a little bit about getting the 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.690
 time and so the ccr it is all alone 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.920
 that's what I was waiting for so here I am 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.500
 I tell you next time to take 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.300
 chaduteaud on my channel of course has to 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.300
 call the world ciao
