like<00:02:57.080> taking<00:02:57.350> snapshots<00:02:57.740> one-timers<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.720> i

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
like taking snapshots one-timers so i

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.600 
like taking snapshots one-timers so i
put<00:03:00.020> my<00:03:00.140> accuracy<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:00.800> not<00:03:01.100> as<00:03:01.250> much<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.430> my

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
put my accuracy up not as much as my

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.370 
put my accuracy up not as much as my

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
wrist shot but i still have it up so i

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.020 
wrist shot but i still have it up so i

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
sticks checking 85 so this is where the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.590 
sticks checking 85 so this is where the

defensive<00:03:45.170> categories<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:46.160> can<00:03:46.280> only<00:03:46.459> get

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
defensive categories you can only get

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.449 
defensive categories you can only get
everything<00:03:47.330> up<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.660> like<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> eighty<00:03:48.170> 180<00:03:49.010> and

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
everything up to like a eighty 180 and

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.340 
everything up to like a eighty 180 and
then<00:03:50.060> stick<00:03:50.420> checking<00:03:50.810> that's<00:03:51.020> why<00:03:51.140> we<00:03:51.260> have

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
then stick checking that's why we have

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.840 
then stick checking that's why we have
the<00:03:51.440> plus<00:03:51.650> five<00:03:51.830> boost<00:03:52.100> there<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:52.550> we<00:03:52.670> can<00:03:52.760> get

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
the plus five boost there so we can get

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.090 
the plus five boost there so we can get
it<00:03:52.970> up<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.090> 85<00:03:53.630> look<00:03:54.440> how<00:03:54.500> much<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.890> cost

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
it up to 85 look how much that cost

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.540 
it up to 85 look how much that cost
right<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.780> 164<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> next<00:03:57.260> upgrade<00:03:57.550> that's

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
right there 164 the next upgrade that's

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.930 
right there 164 the next upgrade that's
pretty<00:03:58.730> insane<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> it's<00:04:01.400> definitely<00:04:01.730> hard<00:04:01.880> to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
pretty insane so it's definitely hard to

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.040 
pretty insane so it's definitely hard to
get<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.330> there<00:04:02.360> even<00:04:02.690> though<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:02.930> like

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
get that up there even though it's like

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.270 
get that up there even though it's like
one<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.350> most<00:04:03.470> important<00:04:03.920> out<00:04:04.100> of<00:04:04.190> this

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
one of the most important out of this

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.020 
one of the most important out of this
whole<00:04:04.459> category<00:04:04.670> for<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.270> winger<00:04:06.880> along<00:04:07.880> with

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
whole category for a winger along with

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.020 
whole category for a winger along with
the<00:04:08.209> discipline<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.110> defensible<00:04:09.500> awareness

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
the discipline and defensible awareness

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.699 
the discipline and defensible awareness
so<00:04:11.030> that's<00:04:11.270> that<00:04:11.450> for<00:04:11.660> defense<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.440> now<00:04:12.530> onto

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
so that's that for defense and now onto

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.430 
so that's that for defense and now onto
athleticism<00:04:13.520> you<00:04:14.000> see<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.959> plus<00:04:15.140> 8<00:04:15.320> on

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
athleticism you see the plus 8 on

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.680 
athleticism you see the plus 8 on
accelerations<00:04:16.040> that's<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.549> chill<00:04:17.480> t

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
accelerations that's so you can chill t

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.449 
accelerations that's so you can chill t
that's<00:04:18.169> how<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.620> use<00:04:18.770> more<00:04:19.010> points<00:04:19.370> on

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
that's how you can use more points on

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.490 
that's how you can use more points on
acceleration<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.359> speed<00:04:20.390> until<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.200> get<00:04:21.320> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
acceleration and speed until you get the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.450 
acceleration and speed until you get the
+<00:04:22.510> 57<00:04:23.510> s<00:04:23.780> for<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
+ 57 s for the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.100 
+ 57 s for the
so<00:04:26.460> accelerations<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.270> 83<00:04:27.930> agility<00:04:28.500> as<00:04:28.770> an<00:04:28.919> 82

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
so accelerations of 83 agility as an 82

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.710 
so accelerations of 83 agility as an 82
balance<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.230> at<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.410> 78<00:04:32.210> durability<00:04:33.210> didn't

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
balance is at a 78 durability didn't

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990 
balance is at a 78 durability didn't
even<00:04:33.870> touch<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:34.710> endurance<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.280> 75

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
even touch that and then endurance is 75

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.560 
even touch that and then endurance is 75
and<00:04:36.389> speeds<00:04:37.169> up<00:04:37.290> at<00:04:37.410> 86<00:04:37.949> with<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.310> plus<00:04:38.610> 7<00:04:38.940> and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
and speeds up at 86 with the plus 7 and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.450 
and speeds up at 86 with the plus 7 and
then<00:04:39.630> strengthen<00:04:40.139> up<00:04:40.229> 67<00:04:40.979> I<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.310> upgrade

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
then strengthen up 67 I like to upgrade

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.340 
then strengthen up 67 I like to upgrade
that<00:04:41.850> slowly<00:04:42.330> as<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.780> level<00:04:43.620> up<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.970> can

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
that slowly as I level up so you can

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.600 
that slowly as I level up so you can
fight<00:04:46.350> off<00:04:46.500> hits<00:04:46.710> more<00:04:46.919> throws<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.430> hits

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
fight off hits more throws that hits

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.950 
fight off hits more throws that hits
more<00:04:47.880> without<00:04:48.389> upgrading<00:04:48.600> bodychecking<00:04:49.350> and

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
more without upgrading bodychecking and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.680 
more without upgrading bodychecking and
have<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:51.990> harder<00:04:52.290> shot<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:52.919> that's<00:04:53.910> SAT<00:04:54.240> for<00:04:54.510> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
have a harder shot so that's SAT for the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.900 
have a harder shot so that's SAT for the
playmaker<00:04:55.290> winger<00:04:55.919> build<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.460> mean<00:04:56.610> if<00:04:56.760> you're

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
playmaker winger build I mean if you're

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.580 
playmaker winger build I mean if you're
a<00:04:56.940> center<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.510> definitely<00:04:58.169> have<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.350> change

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
a center you definitely have to change

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.740 
a center you definitely have to change
out<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.310> pretty<00:05:00.180> much<00:05:00.210> put<00:05:00.479> everything

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
out this and pretty much put everything

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.400 
out this and pretty much put everything
on<00:05:00.930> faceoffs<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.750> yeah<00:05:03.900> there<00:05:04.290> we<00:05:04.380> go

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
on faceoffs so yeah there we go

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.020 
on faceoffs so yeah there we go
playmaker<00:05:05.300> superstar<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:07.220> winger<00:05:08.220> let<00:05:08.910> me

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030
