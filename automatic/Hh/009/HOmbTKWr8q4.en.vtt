00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
go deeper so you can see the red line

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:29.760 
go deeper so you can see the red line
right<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:22.189> runs<00:01:23.189> along<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:26.090> over<00:01:27.090> here

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.300 

so<00:01:31.240> while<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:32.480> were<00:01:32.800> letting<00:01:33.800> them<00:01:33.920> know<00:01:33.950> how

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
so while we were letting them know how

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.230 
so while we were letting them know how
deep<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.700> had<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.940> dig<00:01:35.180> or<00:01:36.170> they<00:01:36.410> went<00:01:36.590> down

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
deep you had to dig or they went down

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.660 
deep you had to dig or they went down
and<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.720> can<00:01:38.900> see<00:01:39.140> they<00:01:39.980> got<00:01:40.190> into<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.520> red

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.530 
and you can see they got into the red
line<00:01:40.910> here<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:42.740> as<00:01:43.400> soon<00:01:43.730> as<00:01:43.820> we<00:01:44.000> seemed<00:01:44.360> good

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
