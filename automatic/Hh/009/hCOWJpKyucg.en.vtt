00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi guys today i show you how 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 make this box 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.760
 this is a box that can hold is 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.110
 a gift for example for a person 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.940
 special 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.849
 I completed it with this ribbon 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
 golden and with this little flower you 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.380
 you can embellish it however you like 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.930
 to make our box 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 take a square sheet 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.720
 we see the corners of the square towards the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.720
 center 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.190
 now let's take one side of the square e 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.190
 we bring it to the center 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.440
 we take this other side we carry it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440
 also in the center 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.580
 we open and do the same wide 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.590
 on the other side therefore for time 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.070
 let's take this side and bring it to the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 center 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.170
 and then this side back to the center 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.080
 now we have to go and trace the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:16.170
 angles as you see here are created 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.239
 so this is the square 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.819
 we have to fold the sheet into this 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.910
 However, we are only going to trace 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.780
 the lines inside these pictures 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.569
 therefore not the whole diagonal 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.569
 but only the tips 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:03.620
 ok we have this triangle on 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:07.130
 this one we go to bend again 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:17.430
 we mark this line full 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:23.060
 we also fold here and open now 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.060
 we must approach these two sides 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.980
 in this way we lower 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.370
 let's turn the paper we do the same 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.370
 also on this side therefore we approach 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.560
 and let's get down and here is ours 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.790
 box was made 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.230
 now we can complete ours 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.230
 box also with a lid 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.480
 take a square sheet of the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.820
 same size as the other sheet 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.270
 we ask the angles again towards the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.270
 center 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.320
 when we go to fold the side to the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.410
 we should not center this time 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.510
 stop right in the center where 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.520
 all three of us say our own 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.520
 tips but we stop a little earlier 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:00.050
 we leave some space in the center 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:00.050
 let's say a finger more or less the spaces 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.469
 also of which we do the same 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.129
 leaving more or less a finger of space 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:28.189
 we open we mark the corners of ours 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.189
 pictures that are giving to extremes 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:58.430
 we again bend it where already 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.430
 there is the fold 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:19.050
 now we raise it was this known that 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.050
 it was this other side 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:38.409
 and behold our cover 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:50.159
 completed now we take the below 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:50.159
 in the box and we're going to close 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.430
 we can complete our box ad 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.180
 example with a golden ribbon is a 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.820
 floret 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.500
 and here is the box complete well guys 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.690
 I hope this tutorial is there 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.880
 liked I recommend you put me like 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.540
 write to the channel and see you at 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.540
