00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:12.240
 the day for the first time in a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.000
 exceptional place close to the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:26.340
 home where born frédéric shop in speaks 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 my parents were surrounded by affection 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.719
 understanding of serenity 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 I may not have been a child 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.570
 terribly wise 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:46.280
 finally I respected my parents the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 loved and then there was interest in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.539
 the taste or tastes of the child 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.260
 there was there was the concern of 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.699
 maintain a perfect harmony between 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 my older brother who was also 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.060
 the inspirer for me the inspirer of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 violin 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.930
 it's on the piano that I work my 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.869
 percussion it's on the piano that 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.049
 I organize the structure the infrastructure 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.509
 trees that I interpret 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 when it comes to works for violin 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.430
 alone as works of Bach or 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.430
 bartok reggae 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:37.070
 only here is the piano was me 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.070
 taught by an admirable teacher 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 patients 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.840
 firm with great gentleness 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.940
 the teacher who knew so well 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.320
 explain why it was my 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 best teacher I was mom and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.470
 I started the piano I asked him 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.370
 to give me piano lessons and 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.590
 of harmony when I was five years old and 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.120
 that's about when I was 7 years old 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.370
 and a half that I was fascinated by the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.290
 way to play my brother's violin 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 because I did not understand resells not 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.770
 how we could manage 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.770
 easily on a key that is black 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.300
 if you have the time you 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
 belongs 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.090
 well yes this English campaign 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.600
 she is very special difficult to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.120
 describe to tell her that she is beautiful 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 that she calm you down she makes you 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 think of the pastoral scenes 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.790
 all that would be practically i would say 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.770
 that would be to say the mundane things 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.600
 I think it goes a lot further 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 spiritually 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.510
 yes your eyes receive the message but 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.070
 I think you associate the campaign 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.170
 English also to everything that happened 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.239
 because 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.390
 it's peaceful countryside been the place of 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.780
 extremely cruel and without 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.780
 guarantee 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.959
 and then there is also an admirable thing 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:45.299
 the way the British 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:49.219
 conceive the fact that the empire is only 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.219
 more a necessity in their father 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.730
 e 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.630
 and 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.110
 m 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.130
 m 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.340
 a drawing 1941 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:32.750
 without going together to mexico it was 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:35.330
 an african state visit area but 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.000
 behind this visit to there was also 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.950
 a cry of distress 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.040
 it was indeed 4 th neil 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.840
 Polish who could not return 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.430
 and of course in their country in value 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.250
 on the side is the only country in the world 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.979
 who are you the generosity not only of 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:02.060
 allow these four new ones the same 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:06.530
 to disembark but also who has them 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:11.150
 welcomed and nn new
