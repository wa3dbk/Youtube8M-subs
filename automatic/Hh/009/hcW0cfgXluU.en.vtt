taking a huge leap we want to do
everything<00:00:38.710> sort<00:00:39.430> of<00:00:39.460> an<00:00:39.760> even<00:00:40.090> grander<00:00:40.420> scale

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
everything sort of an even grander scale

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.290 
everything sort of an even grander scale
that<00:00:41.470> we<00:00:41.560> didn't<00:00:41.770> uncharted<00:00:42.220> two<00:00:42.370> one<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.210> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
that we didn't uncharted two one of the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.250 
that we didn't uncharted two one of the
things<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:43.870> know<00:00:43.960> I've<00:00:44.050> thought<00:00:44.200> about

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
things that you know I've thought about

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.960 
things that you know I've thought about
it<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.829> lot<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:45.399> things<00:00:45.550> we<00:00:45.700> did<00:00:45.820> none

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
it a lot of the things we did none

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.330 
it a lot of the things we did none
charted<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.420> sort<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.410> foundation<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.010> we

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
charted to sort of the foundation for we

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.069 
charted to sort of the foundation for we
did<00:00:48.520> for<00:00:48.670> uncharted<00:00:49.030> 3<00:00:49.059> in<00:00:49.329> terms<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.630> how<00:00:49.809> far

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
did for uncharted 3 in terms of how far

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.959 
did for uncharted 3 in terms of how far
we're<00:00:50.290> taking<00:00:50.620> things<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:51.160> train<00:00:51.760> sequence

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
we're taking things the train sequence

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.120 
we're taking things the train sequence
and<00:00:52.360> craftsy<00:00:52.630> building<00:00:52.930> sequence<00:00:53.320> those<00:00:54.040> were

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
and craftsy building sequence those were

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.860 
and craftsy building sequence those were
pretty<00:00:54.309> intense<00:00:54.460> over<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.000> top<00:00:55.180> moments<00:00:55.390> it's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
pretty intense over the top moments it's

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.030 
pretty intense over the top moments it's
like<00:00:56.230> we're<00:00:56.469> going<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.649> take<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:57.010> even

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
like we're going to take that even

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.950 
like we're going to take that even
farther<00:00:57.610> here<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.030> go<00:00:58.090> we<00:00:58.210> sort<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.480> proved<00:00:58.780> we

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
farther here we go we sort of proved we

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.430 
farther here we go we sort of proved we
could<00:00:59.079> do<00:00:59.200> certain<00:00:59.530> really<00:01:00.010> awesome<00:01:00.399> physics

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
could do certain really awesome physics

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.799 
could do certain really awesome physics
scenarios<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.370> we're<00:01:03.579> trying<00:01:03.700> to<00:01:03.879> do<00:01:03.969> that<00:01:04.149> one

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
scenarios so we're trying to do that one

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.289 
scenarios so we're trying to do that one
of<00:01:04.899> the<00:01:04.960> ones<00:01:05.079> is<00:01:05.379> we<00:01:05.770> reveal<00:01:06.100> that<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:07.000> press

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
of the ones is we reveal that the press

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.639 
of the ones is we reveal that the press

shooting<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.780> mean<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.560> more<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.130> can

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
shooting up I mean what more of that can

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.250 
shooting up I mean what more of that can
we<00:03:11.490> expect<00:03:11.820> well<00:03:12.330> everything<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.140> we're

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
we expect well everything that we're

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
we expect well everything that we're
trying<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.760> multiplayer<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.180> really

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
trying to do with multiplayer is really

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.020 
trying to do with multiplayer is really
the<00:03:15.570> plate<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:15.990> strengths<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.530> what

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
the plate of the strengths of what

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.310 
the plate of the strengths of what
uncharted<00:03:18.030> harness<00:03:18.810> or<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> signature

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
uncharted harness or a signature

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.750 
uncharted harness or a signature
gameplay<00:03:19.770> sort<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.070> having<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.400> verticality

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
gameplay sort of having the verticality

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.060 
gameplay sort of having the verticality
the<00:03:21.150> traversal<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.870> platforming<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.860> I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
the traversal the platforming and I

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.380 
the traversal the platforming and I
think<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.430> sort<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.670> best<00:03:23.910> one<00:03:24.240> of<00:03:24.270> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
think that's sort of the best one of the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.699 
think that's sort of the best one of the
best<00:03:24.540> examples<00:03:24.660> there<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.320> terms<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
best examples there in terms of the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.530 
best examples there in terms of the
verticality<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.520> of<00:03:26.730> our<00:03:26.850> levels<00:03:27.209> everyone

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
verticality all of our levels everyone

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.210 
verticality all of our levels everyone
we're<00:03:27.720> approaching<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.380> design<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
we're approaching the design for the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.980 
we're approaching the design for the
environments<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> levels<00:03:30.209> for<00:03:30.390> both

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
environments or the levels for both

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.600 
environments or the levels for both
multiplayer<00:03:31.410> co-op<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:32.100> all<00:03:32.190> about<00:03:32.370> trying

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
multiplayer co-op it's all about trying

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.280 
multiplayer co-op it's all about trying
to<00:03:32.640> give<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> lot<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.450> vertical<00:03:33.600> space<00:03:34.050> to

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
to give you a lot of vertical space to

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.750 
to give you a lot of vertical space to
go<00:03:34.380> into<00:03:34.530> think<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.220> something<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.550> not

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
go into think it's something that not

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
go into think it's something that not
very<00:03:35.790> many<00:03:36.120> games<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.870> opportunity<00:03:37.380> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
very many games have the opportunity to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.960 
very many games have the opportunity to
do<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:37.860> we're<00:03:38.190> really<00:03:38.370> trying<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.640> blow<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
do so so we're really trying to blow it

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.660 
do so so we're really trying to blow it
out<00:03:39.060> even<00:03:39.330> more<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:39.660> here<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.920> going<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.640> to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
out even more so here and going back to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.350 
out even more so here and going back to
you<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.270> that's<00:03:43.170> vertical<00:03:44.150> traversal<00:03:45.150> but

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
you know that's vertical traversal but

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.790 
you know that's vertical traversal but
we're<00:03:45.750> also<00:03:45.840> sort<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.200> trying<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.440> bring<00:03:46.650> in

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
we're also sort of trying to bring in

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.040 
we're also sort of trying to bring in
these<00:03:47.000> cinematic<00:03:48.000> moments<00:03:48.420> into<00:03:48.750> multiplayer

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
these cinematic moments into multiplayer

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.860 
these cinematic moments into multiplayer
on<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.950> multiplayer<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.420> competitive

multiplayer side there's that airstrip

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.400 
multiplayer side there's that airstrip
there<00:03:53.820> are<00:03:53.940> there<00:03:54.240> strip<00:03:54.570> sequence<00:03:54.959> where

the trucks are moving back and forth you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.090 
the trucks are moving back and forth you
can<00:04:00.570> jump<00:04:00.900> between<00:04:01.050> truck<00:04:01.530> sort<00:04:01.800> of<00:04:01.890> these<00:04:01.980> are

I<00:04:15.450> mean<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.930> guys<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.260> skilled<00:04:17.010> at<00:04:17.130> creating

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
I mean you guys are skilled at creating

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.400 
I mean you guys are skilled at creating
those<00:04:17.640> holy<00:04:17.910> moments<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.170> can't

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
those holy moments it's like I can't

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.599 
those holy moments it's like I can't
believe<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:19.799> happened<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.370> know<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
believe that just happened you know the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.680 
believe that just happened you know the
first<00:04:20.790> time<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> lot<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.209> people<00:04:21.420> saw<00:04:21.540> that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
first time a lot of people saw that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.990 
first time a lot of people saw that
train<00:04:21.959> sequence<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.920> was<00:04:23.040> like<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.640> just<00:04:23.670> blew

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
train sequence it was like it just blew

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.520 
train sequence it was like it just blew
everybody's<00:04:24.480> mind<00:04:24.540> nobody<00:04:24.960> knew<00:04:25.200> what<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> do

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
everybody's mind nobody knew what to do
