00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello today I propose you to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 make an apricot jam for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.160
 it's very simple we need 500 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 apricots 400 g sugar 1 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 half lemon and jars of jam 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.830
 empty 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.480
 to start we are pitted 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.039
 our shelters that we have of course before 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 the meals will be then to check 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 we have 500 grams of fruit on 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 can we put apricots directly 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.610
 in the pan by cutting them in half 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.750
 or in four years make little ones or 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 hunk of our make up 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.510
 now that our apricots are 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 cut out we will add the sugar 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:58.969
 in a single stroke we will also add 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.969
 the juice of half a lemon a little near 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.240
 the lemon juice will help the jam to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:21.689
 take 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 then we mix now that our 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.280
 apricots are well coated with sugar 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 we will let them rest one night 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.619
 the best available 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.890
 if we are in a hurry we can let it rest 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 a couple of hours after twelve 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 rest hours sugar and fruits 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 have macerate law we have a pretty 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.110
 siro so let's go now leather the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.479
 jam we will bring it to a boil 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.860
 once she bora we will keep her 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.679
 for about twenty minutes to 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.350
 little broth while our 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.209
 jams cooked regularly one stirs 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 and we will heat water for 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.280
 to sterilize our skins we will put the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 pots with lids in the water 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.920
 boiling 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.450
 we have a little eight minutes after eight 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.610
 minutes our many are sterilized on 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 can take them out and drain them on a 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.690
 clean towel is careful of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.820
 do not burn for the jars you 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 can of course reuse old 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.290
 a lot in jam it just takes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.970
 pay attention to the lid that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 has a small joint and after 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.750
 several uses joins only 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.890
 more very tight so it just needs just 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 to buy back lids 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.190
 jam and now cooked on 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
 do not expect her to cool down 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.519
 we pour it directly into our pockets 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:54.650
 sterilized and one fills well until 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:56.000
 brim we wipe their edge a little 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.230
 now before it cools down 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.190
 will be easier to clean more 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.480
 we close we serve well and we return 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.010
 if this operation will allow to 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.510
 hunt towards and sterilize the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.190
 jam and so we can 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.190
 keep for two to three years
