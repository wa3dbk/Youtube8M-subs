00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.700
 few people experience 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.990
 living in a house that has blacks with a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.880
 meter thick 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.920
 It's what happens in the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.919
 It resulted from the transformation in space 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.410
 with the skateboard but not yet 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.640
 I entered the upper district this is a house 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.829
 very good day 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.980
 in testimony of the original construction 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.680
 but as the injured high importance in 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.140
 stone and metal structures 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.629
 have resisted abandonment and have 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.100
 having the space was structurally 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.760
 the whole structure that exists is 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.239
 original to take more original to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.210
 able to perceive previously how 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.210
 I would be getting the peace but the level 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.920
 spillage were already non-existent and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.399
 all goals all movements 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.269
 were completely destroyed 0 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.680
 It was here that a loving work of imagination is 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.900
 fantastic and we know it completely 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.329
 very soon known the process that is 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.479
 very good to realize also what the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.430
 reality to do is that something 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.500
 within her expectations and therefore 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.590
 we still start at the beginning as the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.180
 connection as we entered and 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 As we were mcqueen's family 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.790
 even during the time of the work 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.740
 we have an initial concept and then 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.719
 we subscribe with the stones and with 500 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.620
 discovering that we can seize or 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.590
 not 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.250
 instead of course here I - year 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.410
 still of the original construction 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 the heavy structure of being in good 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:49.280
 state of conservation it does not advance 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 the remaining highly 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.890
 contain everything as simple as possible to keep 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.350
 here on the bottom floor a team goes out there 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.720
 even to keep the office craters 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.450
 industrial lake start 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.710
 a sop on the results for giving more 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 comfort to the rooms 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.010
 We noticed staff was corrected until 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.230
 asked who at the time on the walls 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.470
 We keep the blacks some. 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.800
 end we can enjoy the rest and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.900
 black and white while new ceilings 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 habitats as simple as possible 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.410
 please 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.690
 so the ceilings are white walls 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.280
 Let's get there. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.010
 perform existing years ago 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.860
 say flu 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.379
 insert the dividers to the donor who 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.079
 pointed out a beautiful of the rooms 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.620
 the tiled floor is completely open and with 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.170
 of the area was dedicated to the kitchen area 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 who made dreams and living room 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.239
 those responsible for the bird and the cef 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.120
 architects who have been asked to 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.060
 renovation project did not interfere with 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.700
 decoration but knew beforehand which 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.769
 would be the owner's options 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.989
 with this knowledge they opted for 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.930
 to introduce lighting essentially 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.269
 direct from the Acim with some points of the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.299
 light on the ceiling 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.840
 the new elements introduced are 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.879
 discreet and to have something crucho is intention to 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.579
 be the elements of architecture 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.579
 industrial and still existing
