00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.650
 of precipitation you have only once 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.839
 enough 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 no matter what kind of augsburger snow 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.029
 Game is in village and worked up 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.579
 especially hard-boiled digestion 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.649
 anyway outside with a particularly heavy 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.570
 the positive thing happens quickly 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:31.439
 English week first home game new 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 opponent new conditions bremer 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.129
 player now is a completely different one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.850
 Partie bremen is probably also very good 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.190
 on it has a good match now against 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 hertha played you have to see 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 which opponents is there and therefore think 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.089
 me that we still in a good 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.999
 will be tomorrow and tomorrow 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.920
 of course try all three points too 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.289
 want to keep home the game 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 win by tomorrow then 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.309
 right in the season in the second half 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 to get in is translated 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.780
 in the points language 3 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.360
 the price of gas from weser and place 12 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 and with very good known meaning 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 are obviously not know 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.610
 only jannik vestergaard and kastells were 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.940
 she expected there 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 in the season a nice arena of course 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.970
 all hope that there is a known team 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.640
 where right-wing extremists due ra after 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.610
 bubbles due to room switch and 23 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.650
 Ball contact us already to the gate 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 is that we must also try 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.870
 then passed since you have for this thing 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 be clear and jannik vista the man who 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.720
 has already shown his class and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.220
 happy that he is with us and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 We wish him to keep it up 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.380
 marches and makes a goodbye on 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.200
 19 th day and at the age of impact 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 So out there there are bremen susceptible 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.240
 is only five points in the foreign - 16 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 goal difference last place in the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.899
 away table 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.409
 just how we play 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.300
 tomorrow and we want really colorful 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.519
 Do not just get that we're hiding there 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.040
 or we also want to react to ourselves 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.099
 The children take care of it as well 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.569
 strong this strong I mean 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.519
 body language right our opponents 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.000
 trouble we all the more we have to 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.379
 our home strength also focus and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.370
 We already know that at home too 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.620
 in the 18th 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 that we also have a great home record 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 and that we often really good 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.750
 have delivered games and want to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.299
 to tie up 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.299
 there it does not matter how the enemy means no matter 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.160
 Although in this case just sv Werder the 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.680
 hanseaten already lost the last one 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 three away games number four should be 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.120
 maybe the tsg will help 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.200
 yes that the philosophies are not quite 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.019
 are dissimilar 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 Nevertheless, Bremen has a rather offensive 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.739
 but the game has to wait 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 to what extent the team is now in 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.010
 the winter break also continues normally 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 has developed which attack for you 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.040
 Even from Ford in the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.049
 of course not seen back round 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 It is clear that it is only the game that is now 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.489
 outward, what march route they have 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.870
 That's why you're always there 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.450
 still a bit in the dark 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.730
 what's waiting for us but one 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.590
 a little uncertainty also contributes to 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.810
 tension when and if the addressed 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.670
 come in the back then tomorrow 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.950
 evening worked that is with the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.950
 precipitation is finally ticked off
