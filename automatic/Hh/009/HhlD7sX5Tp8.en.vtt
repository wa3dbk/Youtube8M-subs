00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.350> we're<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.680> to

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
all right in this video we're going to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.439 
all right in this video we're going to
take<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:01.979> look<00:00:02.190> at<00:00:02.340> finding<00:00:02.760> roots<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.270> complex

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
take a look at finding roots of complex

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.539 
take a look at finding roots of complex
numbers<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.380> idea<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.220> if<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.400> have<00:00:05.490> a

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
numbers and the idea is if you have a

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.049 
numbers and the idea is if you have a
complex<00:00:05.970> number<00:00:06.359> in<00:00:06.450> polar<00:00:06.480> form<00:00:07.340> R<00:00:08.340> times<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
complex number in polar form R times the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.990 
complex number in polar form R times the
quantity<00:00:09.269> cosine<00:00:09.599> theta<00:00:10.110> plus<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.590> sine<00:00:10.860> theta

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
quantity cosine theta plus I sine theta

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.959 
quantity cosine theta plus I sine theta
to<00:00:12.000> find<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> roots<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.290> take<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:14.490> take<00:00:14.639> our<00:00:14.790> R

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
to find the roots we take we take our R

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.480 
to find the roots we take we take our R
value<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> nth<00:00:15.990> root<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.859> then

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
value take the nth root of that and then

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
value take the nth root of that and then
we<00:00:17.609> have<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> calculate<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.900> quantity

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
we have to calculate this quantity

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.000 
we have to calculate this quantity
cosine<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.949> theta<00:00:20.369> plus<00:00:20.550> 2<00:00:21.060> pi<00:00:21.090> K<00:00:21.660> over<00:00:22.470> n<00:00:22.650> plus

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
cosine of theta plus 2 pi K over n plus

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.050 
cosine of theta plus 2 pi K over n plus
I<00:00:23.460> sine<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.850> theta<00:00:24.300> plus<00:00:24.689> 2<00:00:24.960> pi<00:00:24.990> K<00:00:25.500> over<00:00:26.099> N<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
I sine of theta plus 2 pi K over N and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.080 
I sine of theta plus 2 pi K over N and
we'll<00:00:27.210> let<00:00:27.300> K<00:00:27.630> vary<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:28.380> 0<00:00:28.830> 1<00:00:29.099> 2<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
we'll let K vary from 0 1 2 up to the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.459 
we'll let K vary from 0 1 2 up to the
value<00:00:30.480> n<00:00:30.740> minus<00:00:31.740> 1<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.719> looks<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:33.989> worse

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
value n minus 1 so looks a little worse

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.959 
value n minus 1 so looks a little worse
and<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.840> hopefully<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.969> one

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and I think what it is hopefully so one

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
and I think what it is hopefully so one
thing<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.870> always<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.800> you're

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
thing you'll always have to do if you're

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.500 
thing you'll always have to do if you're
given<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> complex<00:00:41.399> number<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.329> not

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
given a complex number if it's not

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.030 
given a complex number if it's not
already<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.989> polar<00:00:43.230> form<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
already in polar form you're going to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.240 
already in polar form you're going to
have<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.579> polar<00:00:44.760> form<00:00:45.800> okay<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have to put it in polar form okay so in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
have to put it in polar form okay so in
our<00:00:47.370> example<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> find<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> 2

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
our example here we want to find the 2

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.220 
our example here we want to find the 2
square<00:00:49.170> roots<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.760> 4<00:00:50.760> times<00:00:51.149> cosine<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> 90

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
square roots of 4 times cosine of 90

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340 
square roots of 4 times cosine of 90
degrees<00:00:52.559> plus<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.190> sine<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.850> 90<00:00:54.539> degrees

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
degrees plus I sine of 90 degrees

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.270 
degrees plus I sine of 90 degrees
and<00:00:58.020> let's<00:00:59.020> just<00:00:59.200> use<00:00:59.320> our<00:00:59.440> formula<00:00:59.890> here<00:00:59.920> so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
and let's just use our formula here so

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.560 
and let's just use our formula here so
we're<00:01:00.970> going<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.150> take<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.450> square<00:01:01.690> roots

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.830 

and<00:01:07.020> again<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.410> taking<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> square<00:01:08.070> root

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and again we're taking a square root

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.060 
and again we're taking a square root
we're<00:01:09.840> taking<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.230> second<00:01:10.710> word<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.920> then

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
we're taking a second word here so then

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.450 
we're taking a second word here so then
we<00:01:14.190> would<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.370> cosine<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.480> well<00:01:16.100> 90<00:01:17.100> degrees

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
we would have cosine of well 90 degrees

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
we would have cosine of well 90 degrees
plus<00:01:17.840> okay<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.050> use<00:01:19.080> 2pi<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.010> formula

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
plus okay we use 2pi in the formula

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.710 
plus okay we use 2pi in the formula
equivalently<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:22.130> 360<00:01:23.130> degrees

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
equivalently we can use 360 degrees

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.969 
equivalently we can use 360 degrees
times<00:01:24.720> K<00:01:25.940> over<00:01:26.940> N<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.870> we<00:01:28.020> can't<00:01:28.200> squeeze<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
times K over N if we can't squeeze this

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.780 
times K over N if we can't squeeze this
one<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:30.979> plus<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.220> sine<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:34.790> 90

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
one all in here plus I sine of 90

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.990 
one all in here plus I sine of 90
degrees<00:01:36.210> plus<00:01:36.900> 360<00:01:37.620> degrees<00:01:38.750> times<00:01:39.750> K<00:01:40.940> over<00:01:41.940> N

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
degrees plus 360 degrees times K over N

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
degrees plus 360 degrees times K over N
all<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.300> now<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.900> have<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.320> K

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
all right so now what we have to do K

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.390 
all right so now what we have to do K
can<00:01:47.580> vary<00:01:47.940> from<00:01:48.869> 0<00:01:49.740> 1<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.000> n<00:01:51.240> minus<00:01:51.450> 1<00:01:52.410> well

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
can vary from 0 1 up to n minus 1 well

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.749 
can vary from 0 1 up to n minus 1 well
in<00:01:53.550> this<00:01:53.670> case<00:01:53.940> since<00:01:54.509> N<00:01:54.720> equals<00:01:55.170> 2<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:56.460> n

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
in this case since N equals 2 well n

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.670 
in this case since N equals 2 well n
minus<00:01:57.390> 1<00:01:57.660> would<00:01:57.900> be<00:01:58.050> well<00:01:58.770> 2<00:01:59.280> minus<00:01:59.640> 1<00:01:59.910> or<00:02:00.240> 1<00:02:00.900> so

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
minus 1 would be well 2 minus 1 or 1 so

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
minus 1 would be well 2 minus 1 or 1 so
the<00:02:01.800> idea<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.220> we're<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.580> have<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> use

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the idea is we're going to have to use

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.990 
the idea is we're going to have to use
this<00:02:03.330> formula<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.310> all<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> do

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this formula but all we're going to do

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
this formula but all we're going to do
is<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.450> plug<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> values<00:02:07.320> k

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is we're going to plug in the values k

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.180 
is we're going to plug in the values k
equals<00:02:08.009> 0<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.700> k<00:02:09.000> equals<00:02:09.450> 1<00:02:09.860> we'll<00:02:10.860> simplify

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
equals 0 and k equals 1 we'll simplify

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.420 
equals 0 and k equals 1 we'll simplify
those<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.880> those<00:02:11.970> will<00:02:12.180> give<00:02:12.330> us<00:02:12.480> our<00:02:12.720> roots

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
those and those will give us our roots

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.720 
those and those will give us our roots
ok<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.489> let's<00:02:14.820> do<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> k<00:02:15.269> equals<00:02:15.840> 0<00:02:16.320> case<00:02:16.730> well

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
ok so let's do the k equals 0 case well

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.910 
ok so let's do the k equals 0 case well
the<00:02:17.850> square<00:02:18.060> root<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.269> 4<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.959> 2

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
the square root of 4 that's just 2

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.470 
the square root of 4 that's just 2
and<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.370> would<00:02:21.460> have<00:02:21.610> cosine<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:24.480> let's

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and then we would have cosine of let's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.540 
and then we would have cosine of let's
see<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.630> only<00:02:25.960> put<00:02:26.260> our<00:02:26.380> n<00:02:26.590> in<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> bottom<00:02:27.190> we

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
see I only put our n in the bottom we

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.920 
see I only put our n in the bottom we
can<00:02:27.580> even<00:02:27.910> go<00:02:28.000> ahead<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.270> put<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
can even go ahead and put the two in the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.160 
can even go ahead and put the two in the
bottom<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.410> case<00:02:31.860> okay<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.570> we've<00:02:34.570> got<00:02:34.600> 90

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
bottom in this case okay so we've got 90

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.220 
bottom in this case okay so we've got 90
degrees<00:02:35.560> plus<00:02:36.010> well<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.030> plug<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.300> K<00:02:37.720> equals

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
degrees plus well if we plug in K equals

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
degrees plus well if we plug in K equals
zero<00:02:38.800> we'll<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.430> get<00:02:39.610> well<00:02:40.030> zero<00:02:40.860> over<00:02:41.860> two

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
zero we'll just get well zero over two

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.320 
zero we'll just get well zero over two
plus<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.660> sine<00:02:44.590> will<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.640> same<00:02:45.820> thing<00:02:45.880> will

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
plus I sine will get the same thing will

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.480 
plus I sine will get the same thing will
just<00:02:46.360> get<00:02:46.600> 90<00:02:47.020> degrees<00:02:47.410> plus<00:02:47.740> zero<00:02:48.550> over<00:02:49.120> 2<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
just get 90 degrees plus zero over 2 and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.160 
just get 90 degrees plus zero over 2 and
that's<00:02:51.490> going<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.940> one<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.390> our<00:02:52.540> complex

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
that's going to be one of our complex

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.760 
that's going to be one of our complex
numbers<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.330> other<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.050> other<00:02:56.140> complex

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
numbers the other the other complex

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.060 
numbers the other the other complex
number<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.730> root<00:02:58.030> will<00:02:58.300> be<00:02:58.330> when<00:02:58.660> K<00:02:58.930> equals

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
number the root will be when K equals

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.600 
number the root will be when K equals
one<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.209> use<00:03:01.360> K<00:03:01.630> equals<00:03:01.959> one

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
one and if we use K equals one

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.340 
one and if we use K equals one
well<00:03:03.610> again<00:03:03.880> out<00:03:04.120> front<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.050> square

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
well again out front we have the square

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.900 
well again out front we have the square
root<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.620> four<00:03:05.890> which<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:06.459> going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> give

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
root of four which is just going to give

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
root of four which is just going to give
us<00:03:07.030> two<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:09.070> again<00:03:09.700> plugging<00:03:10.239> in<00:03:10.510> K

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
us two and then again plugging in K

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.140 
us two and then again plugging in K
equals<00:03:10.959> one<00:03:11.680> into<00:03:11.950> our<00:03:11.980> formula<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.910> we<00:03:13.000> would

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
equals one into our formula so we would

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.900 
equals one into our formula so we would
have<00:03:13.270> cosine<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:14.520> 90<00:03:15.520> degrees<00:03:15.910> plus<00:03:16.470> 360

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
have cosine of 90 degrees plus 360

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.440 
have cosine of 90 degrees plus 360
degrees<00:03:18.910> over<00:03:19.480> two

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
degrees over two

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.430 
degrees over two
plus<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.319> sine<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:24.050> 90<00:03:25.050> degrees<00:03:25.500> plus<00:03:26.030> 360

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
plus I sine of 90 degrees plus 360

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.580 
plus I sine of 90 degrees plus 360
degrees<00:03:28.440> over<00:03:29.069> 2<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.200> would<00:03:31.349> be<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
degrees over 2 and that would be the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.910 
degrees over 2 and that would be the
other<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.330> let's<00:03:33.330> go<00:03:33.450> ahead<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.920> simplify

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
other one so let's go ahead and simplify

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.860 
other one so let's go ahead and simplify
these<00:03:35.280> down<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> little<00:03:35.819> bit

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.410 

so<00:03:42.379> let's<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:42.709> we've<00:03:43.010> got<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.910> for<00:03:44.120> our<00:03:44.209> K

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
so let's see we've got so for our K

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.059 
so let's see we've got so for our K
equals<00:03:44.870> zero<00:03:45.319> case<00:03:47.260> we've<00:03:48.260> got<00:03:48.290> two<00:03:48.650> times

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
equals zero case we've got two times

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.320 
equals zero case we've got two times
cosine<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:50.180> well<00:03:51.019> 90<00:03:51.709> degrees<00:03:52.099> over<00:03:52.700> 2<00:03:52.910> would

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
cosine of well 90 degrees over 2 would

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.630 
cosine of well 90 degrees over 2 would
give<00:03:53.360> us<00:03:53.599> 45<00:03:54.019> degrees<00:03:54.890> plus<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:57.140> sine<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
give us 45 degrees plus I sine of the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.509 
give us 45 degrees plus I sine of the
same<00:03:58.849> thing<00:03:59.180> which<00:03:59.569> will<00:03:59.750> be<00:03:59.840> 45<00:04:00.379> degrees<00:04:01.069> and

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
same thing which will be 45 degrees and

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.580 
same thing which will be 45 degrees and
again<00:04:02.209> we<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:02.569> always<00:04:02.690> clean<00:04:03.110> this<00:04:03.260> up<00:04:03.440> a

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
again we can always clean this up a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.150 
again we can always clean this up a
little<00:04:03.709> bit

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
little bit

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.030 
little bit
cosine<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.640> 45<00:04:05.209> degrees<00:04:05.989> that's<00:04:06.410> root<00:04:06.739> 2<00:04:07.010> over

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
cosine of 45 degrees that's root 2 over

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.289 
cosine of 45 degrees that's root 2 over
2<00:04:08.170> sine<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.200> 45<00:04:09.830> degrees<00:04:09.860> is<00:04:10.610> also<00:04:11.030> going<00:04:11.209> to

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
2 sine of 45 degrees is also going to

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.370 
2 sine of 45 degrees is also going to
give<00:04:11.420> us<00:04:11.569> square<00:04:12.080> root<00:04:12.230> of<00:04:12.290> 2<00:04:12.500> over<00:04:13.099> 2<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:14.569> if

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
give us square root of 2 over 2 and if

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.770 
give us square root of 2 over 2 and if
we<00:04:15.410> distribute<00:04:15.860> out<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.340> tube<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:17.299> twos<00:04:17.540> will

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
we distribute out the tube the twos will

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.690 
we distribute out the tube the twos will
cancel<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.530> we'll<00:04:18.799> just<00:04:18.950> be<00:04:19.070> left<00:04:19.100> with<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
cancel and we'll just be left with the

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.360 
cancel and we'll just be left with the
square<00:04:19.850> root<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.180> 2<00:04:20.440> plus<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> square<00:04:21.979> root<00:04:22.160> of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
square root of 2 plus the square root of

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.820 
square root of 2 plus the square root of
2i<00:04:25.150> ok<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.240> that's<00:04:26.510> going<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.720> be<00:04:26.870> one<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.710> our

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
2i ok so that's going to be one of our

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.400 
2i ok so that's going to be one of our
roots<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:29.270> other<00:04:29.419> will<00:04:29.660> be<00:04:29.690> when<00:04:30.080> K

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
roots and the other will be when K

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.010 
roots and the other will be when K
equals<00:04:31.010> 1<00:04:32.650> C<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:33.830> when<00:04:33.979> K<00:04:34.220> equals<00:04:34.820> 1<00:04:35.120> this<00:04:35.780> was

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
equals 1 C so when K equals 1 this was

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.040 
equals 1 C so when K equals 1 this was
our<00:04:36.169> other<00:04:36.440> value<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:37.820> when<00:04:37.970> K<00:04:38.150> equals<00:04:38.570> 1<00:04:38.810> we'll

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
our other value so when K equals 1 we'll

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.940 
our other value so when K equals 1 we'll
get<00:04:39.169> 2<00:04:39.410> times<00:04:39.710> cosine<00:04:42.699> let's<00:04:43.699> see<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.090> 90<00:04:44.600> plus

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
get 2 times cosine let's see so 90 plus

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.420 
get 2 times cosine let's see so 90 plus
360<00:04:45.950> that's<00:04:46.430> going<00:04:46.610> to<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:47.139> 450<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:49.250> we'll<00:04:49.340> have

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
360 that's going to be 450 so we'll have

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.480 
360 that's going to be 450 so we'll have
450<00:04:50.330> degrees<00:04:50.720> divided<00:04:51.260> by<00:04:51.410> 2

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
450 degrees divided by 2

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.900 
450 degrees divided by 2
well<00:04:53.060> 450<00:04:54.020> degrees<00:04:54.350> divided<00:04:54.919> by<00:04:55.160> 2<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.789> going

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
well 450 degrees divided by 2 is going

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.949 
well 450 degrees divided by 2 is going
to<00:04:56.060> give<00:04:56.180> us<00:04:56.830> 225<00:04:57.830> degrees

00:04:59.949 --> 00:04:59.959 
to give us 225 degrees

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.059 
to give us 225 degrees
plus<00:05:00.959> I<00:05:01.229> sine<00:05:02.039> of<00:05:02.459> the<00:05:02.789> same<00:05:03.059> thing<00:05:04.069> 225

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
plus I sine of the same thing 225

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.469 
plus I sine of the same thing 225
degrees<00:05:07.339> and<00:05:08.339> now<00:05:08.550> we<00:05:08.610> can<00:05:08.879> always<00:05:09.089> just

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
degrees and now we can always just

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.169 
degrees and now we can always just
simplify<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.110> down<00:05:10.469> a<00:05:10.499> little<00:05:10.619> bit<00:05:12.259> so<00:05:14.179> 225

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:15.179 
simplify this down a little bit so 225

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.639 
simplify this down a little bit so 225
degrees<00:05:15.629> 180<00:05:15.959> will<00:05:16.439> be<00:05:16.529> at<00:05:16.619> PI<00:05:16.830> another<00:05:17.520> 225<00:05:18.649> at

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649 
degrees 180 will be at PI another 225 at

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:23.149 
degrees 180 will be at PI another 225 at
225<00:05:20.369> we'll<00:05:21.059> get<00:05:21.240> negative<00:05:21.479> root<00:05:21.929> 2<00:05:22.199> over<00:05:22.559> 2

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
225 we'll get negative root 2 over 2

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.869 
225 we'll get negative root 2 over 2
negative<00:05:24.059> root<00:05:24.479> 2<00:05:24.719> over<00:05:25.080> 2<00:05:25.589> for<00:05:26.009> both<00:05:26.189> cosine

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
negative root 2 over 2 for both cosine

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.529 
negative root 2 over 2 for both cosine
and<00:05:27.059> sine<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.770> we've<00:05:28.919> got<00:05:29.129> 2<00:05:29.399> times<00:05:29.759> negative

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
and sine so we've got 2 times negative

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.379 
and sine so we've got 2 times negative
root<00:05:31.110> 2<00:05:31.409> over<00:05:31.740> 2<00:05:32.929> plus<00:05:33.929> I<00:05:34.169> sine<00:05:35.069> of<00:05:35.129> 225<00:05:35.999> which

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
root 2 over 2 plus I sine of 225 which

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.290 
root 2 over 2 plus I sine of 225 which
is<00:05:36.509> also<00:05:36.869> going<00:05:37.019> to<00:05:37.080> be<00:05:37.259> negative<00:05:38.129> root<00:05:38.669> 2<00:05:38.939> over

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
is also going to be negative root 2 over

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.959 
is also going to be negative root 2 over
2

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 
2

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.129 
2
well<00:05:41.969> again<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.479> same<00:05:42.689> thing<00:05:42.719> if<00:05:43.050> we

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
well again the same thing if we

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.009 
well again the same thing if we
distribute<00:05:43.499> up<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.069> negative<00:05:44.519> 2<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.809> 2's

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:46.019 
distribute up the negative 2 the 2's

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:48.259 
distribute up the negative 2 the 2's
will<00:05:46.139> cancel<00:05:46.199> it<00:05:46.800> will<00:05:47.369> get<00:05:47.519> negative<00:05:47.729> square

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:48.269 
will cancel it will get negative square

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:55.370 
will cancel it will get negative square
root<00:05:48.360> of<00:05:48.449> 2<00:05:48.659> minus<00:05:49.219> square<00:05:50.219> root<00:05:50.909> of<00:05:50.999> 2<00:05:51.059> I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.860 

okay<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.220> that's<00:05:56.640> it<00:05:56.910> we've<00:05:57.150> now<00:05:57.330> got<00:05:57.630> our

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
okay and that's it we've now got our

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.790 
okay and that's it we've now got our
complex<00:05:58.860> roots<00:05:59.220> in<00:05:59.400> this<00:05:59.520> case
