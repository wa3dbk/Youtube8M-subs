get into one of those products in just a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.380 
get into one of those products in just a
second<00:02:40.830> more<00:02:41.220> information<00:02:41.670> about<00:02:41.849> this

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
second more information about this

second more information about this
particular<00:02:42.840> camera<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> color<00:02:51.269> quad

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
particular camera so it's a color quad

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.390 
particular camera so it's a color quad
surveillance<00:02:52.290> system<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.069> hook<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.340> up

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
surveillance system you can hook it up

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220 
surveillance system you can hook it up
to<00:02:53.459> variety<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.030> monitors<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.989> happen

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
to variety of monitors but I just happen

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.630 
to variety of monitors but I just happen
to<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.500> connected<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.890> Slingbox<00:02:56.280> cuz<00:02:56.519> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
to have it connected to Slingbox cuz it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.990 
to have it connected to Slingbox cuz it
makes<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.940> very<00:02:57.799> compatible<00:02:58.799> with<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.819> way

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
makes it very compatible with the way

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.140 
makes it very compatible with the way
that<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.630> use<00:03:01.349> technology<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.310> certainly<00:03:02.519> want

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that I use technology and certainly want

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.760 
that I use technology and certainly want
to<00:03:03.239> use<00:03:03.390> security<00:03:04.319> cameras<00:03:04.980> inside<00:03:05.430> my<00:03:05.640> house
