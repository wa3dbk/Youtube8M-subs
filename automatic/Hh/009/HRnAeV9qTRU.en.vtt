00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
obviously it's not gonna be like Search

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.520 
obviously it's not gonna be like Search
and<00:02:59.850> Destroy<00:02:59.880> they'll<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.420> whole<00:03:00.660> new<00:03:00.870> whole

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
and Destroy they'll be whole new whole

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.110 
and Destroy they'll be whole new whole
new<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.920> secondly<00:03:02.490> they're<00:03:02.730> talking<00:03:03.060> about

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
new one secondly they're talking about

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
new one secondly they're talking about
putting<00:03:03.270> twice<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:04.080> many<00:03:04.230> zombies<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
putting twice as many zombies in the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.730 
putting twice as many zombies in the
game<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.310> also<00:03:05.340> twice<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.030> many<00:03:06.330> players<00:03:06.740> ever

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
game but also twice as many players ever

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.320 
game but also twice as many players ever
since<00:03:08.040> zombies<00:03:08.400> came<00:03:08.550> out<00:03:08.700> we've<00:03:08.880> always<00:03:09.090> been

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
since zombies came out we've always been

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.420 
since zombies came out we've always been
limited<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> four<00:03:10.290> players<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.740> zombies<00:03:11.250> but

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
limited to four players in zombies but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.400 
limited to four players in zombies but
now<00:03:11.580> treyarch<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.330> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.660> expanding

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
now treyarch is going to be expanding

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.560 
now treyarch is going to be expanding
expanding<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.430> limit<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.970> eight<00:03:15.210> players

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
expanding the limit to eight players

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.380 
expanding the limit to eight players
let's<00:03:16.110> double<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.590> players<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> believe

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
let's double the players can you believe

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.030 
let's double the players can you believe
that<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.560> said<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.890> eighth

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
that but like you said that eighth

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.100 
that but like you said that eighth
player<00:03:20.400> feature<00:03:20.820> may<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.390> necessarily<00:03:21.540> be

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
player feature may not necessarily be

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.020 
player feature may not necessarily be
available<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.860> all<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.250> new<00:03:23.400> modes<00:03:23.640> maybe

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
available in all the new modes maybe

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
available in all the new modes maybe
just<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> classic<00:03:24.690> mode<00:03:25.110> or<00:03:25.290> maybe<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.590> in

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
just the classic mode or maybe just in

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.590 
just the classic mode or maybe just in
just<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.250> few<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.580> new<00:03:26.760> game<00:03:27.060> mode<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.480> we're

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
just a few of the new game mode so we're

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.570 
just a few of the new game mode so we're
just<00:03:27.630> gonna<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.050> wait<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.380> see

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
just gonna have to wait and see

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.350 
just gonna have to wait and see
personally<00:03:29.580> I<00:03:29.610> think<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.000> awesome<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
personally I think it's awesome that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.180 
personally I think it's awesome that
they're<00:03:30.570> extending<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> limit<00:03:31.980> with<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
they're extending the limit with the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.740 
they're extending the limit with the
amount<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.430> players<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.970> think<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.390> just

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
amount of players but I think it just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.050 
amount of players but I think it just
might<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.260> bit<00:03:34.590> too<00:03:34.620> much<00:03:35.040> six<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.760> reckon

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
might be a bit too much six I reckon

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
might be a bit too much six I reckon
would<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.270> been<00:03:36.360> an<00:03:36.480> awesome<00:03:36.600> number<00:03:37.220> even

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
would have been an awesome number even

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.750 
would have been an awesome number even
though<00:03:38.280> there's<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.580> much<00:03:38.730> difference

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
though there's not much difference

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.910 
though there's not much difference
between<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.420> two<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:40.110> hard<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.350> explain<00:03:40.530> I

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
between the two it's hard to explain I

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.860 
between the two it's hard to explain I
guess<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.550> reason<00:03:41.670> why<00:03:41.910> they<00:03:42.030> put<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
guess the reason why they put for the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.930 
guess the reason why they put for the
limit<00:03:43.230> for<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.709> first<00:03:43.890> place<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.430> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
limit for in the first place was that so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.550 
limit for in the first place was that so
you<00:03:45.030> would<00:03:45.209> feel<00:03:45.510> overpowered<00:03:46.050> by<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you would feel overpowered by the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.110 
you would feel overpowered by the
zombies<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.190> know<00:03:47.340> there'd<00:03:47.580> only<00:03:47.640> be<00:03:47.880> four

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
zombies so you know there'd only be four

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.990 
zombies so you know there'd only be four
of<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.890> they'll<00:03:49.890> be<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.070> 10<00:03:50.640> times<00:03:50.850> as

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
of you and they'll be like 10 times as

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.310 
of you and they'll be like 10 times as
many<00:03:51.120> zombies<00:03:51.540> coming<00:03:51.750> at<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.080> so<00:03:52.260> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
many zombies coming at you so you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.350 
many zombies coming at you so you
wouldn't<00:03:52.560> feel<00:03:52.830> like<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.190> had<00:03:53.400> control<00:03:53.550> but

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
wouldn't feel like you had control but

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.910 
wouldn't feel like you had control but
eight<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.410> think<00:03:55.590> about<00:03:55.680> having

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
eight you know just think about having

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.259 
eight you know just think about having
double<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.610> amount<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.880> players<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
double the amount of players on the

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.640 
double the amount of players on the
field<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.690> sort<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.959> starts<00:03:58.260> feeling<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.530> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
field it sort of starts feeling like a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.560 
field it sort of starts feeling like a
multiplayer<00:03:59.250> match<00:03:59.489> but<00:03:59.910> I<00:03:59.940> don't<00:04:00.120> know<00:04:00.209> but

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
multiplayer match but I don't know but

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.270 
multiplayer match but I don't know but
yeah<00:04:01.140> basically<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:01.769> just<00:04:01.920> great<00:04:02.100> they're

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
yeah basically it's just great they're

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.070 
yeah basically it's just great they're
extending<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.760> limit<00:04:03.000> anyway<00:04:03.239> also<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
extending the limit anyway also in the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.199 
extending the limit anyway also in the
official<00:04:04.560> trailer<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:05.519> came<00:04:05.730> out<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.060> black

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209

ops 2 a couple days ago if you pause it
at<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.730> moment<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.510> trailer<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.110> the

at this moment in the trailer in the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.990 
at this moment in the trailer in the
background<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.830> see<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.160> light<00:04:11.430> going<00:04:11.850> up

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
background you see that light going up

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.150 
background you see that light going up
into<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> sky<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.200> basically<00:04:13.709> what<00:04:13.980> we're

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
into the sky and basically what we're

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.650 
into the sky and basically what we're
taking<00:04:14.489> from<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.239> that's

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
taking from that is that that's

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.930 
taking from that is that that's
basically<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.290> mystery<00:04:16.769> box<00:04:16.919> we<00:04:17.730> all<00:04:17.850> know

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
basically the mystery box we all know

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.670 
basically the mystery box we all know
the<00:04:18.060> mystery<00:04:18.359> box<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.810> shine<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.230> massive

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
the mystery box to shine that massive

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.830 
the mystery box to shine that massive
beam<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:20.040> light<00:04:20.220> into<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.730> sky<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.359> that

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
beam of light into the sky and that

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360 
beam of light into the sky and that
light<00:04:22.049> looks<00:04:22.350> exactly<00:04:22.620> like<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.190> light

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
light looks exactly like the light

20 25 the answer is we don't know yet
Treyarch<00:05:00.400> might<00:05:00.610> end<00:05:00.880> up<00:05:01.030> doing<00:05:01.300> both<00:05:01.539> putting

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
Treyarch might end up doing both putting

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.620 
Treyarch might end up doing both putting
some<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.530> my<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:03.069> know<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.310> 80s<00:05:03.729> the<00:05:03.970> 90s<00:05:04.150> and

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
some in my you know the 80s the 90s and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.659 
some in my you know the 80s the 90s and
