00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.580
 So dear viewers still passed three 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.370
 of the day 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.889
 so this is a salty battery from 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.549
 previous video you remember she boiled 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.740
 here it is rusty see yes rusty which 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.300
 put in 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 boiled means well practically she on 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 last gasp 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 three days she worked days actually 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.789
 already died that is, we can assume that this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 already 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.090
 Well, very dead and there is something that the crystal 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 glows but it's not about anything 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:44.489
 here means fig destroyed in what is necessary 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 on it is now 237 volts but after that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.090
 how I cooked it after boiling it was 22 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.090
 Volt then charged from the power supply 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 it became three volts to 3 volts and and charged 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 there are more than three, even then it is two o'clock 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.220
 lay down and 265 volts and became 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.320
 And I turned on the LED there, well, the diode 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.049
 otpaivat did not hell with him because 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.340
 that I see no point well, the most important thing is that 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.100
 after cooking 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 it was a dead battery 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 discharged battery after its boiling 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 recharged it from the power supply three 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 of the day I worked 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.270
 here is this battery it is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.450
 actually 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 Well, this is to some extent the battery 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.439
 thats just exactly the exact same 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.500
 the battery is in the small keychain 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:50.970
 which charges from solar 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.420
 so here's the husband someone saw there is such 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.979
 keychain solar battery and there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 pocket such for keys 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.090
 it doesn't matter here it means 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.369
 working eleven days on discharged 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.220
 batteries it is when this one 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.099
 Crystal does not work here vodka became 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.950
 when it is no longer working I took it already 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.260
 the old ones that you walked from a distance took 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.830
 hence the battery and now turned on this diode 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.520
 he has been working for 11 days already 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.920
 would say everything he no longer works 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.360
 the number of volts at day 158 i'm all 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.810
 measured with a multimeter 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.370
 great 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.709
 LED which works from very 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.349
 very small voltage actually 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:47.930
 he already everything well I would say so everything already 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:51.150
 almost not working here these two 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.120
 LED and continues to work here with 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:00.959
 this diode com voltage on it 255 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.989
 I also tried it now so as not to waste 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.819
 I had already measured my time 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 multimeter damage here I have here 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.019
 replaced and now standards continue to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.810
 glow but I'll tell you right away that they 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.790
 dimly lit by the fact that he can you 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.090
 see that there somehow they can be there 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.269
 glows brightly it is actually wrong 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.230
 that status is on the lights means this one 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.269
 reference and this one here is left here 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.790
 they already work here and somewhere already 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.080
 counted six hundred and thirty-two hours well 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.390
 or 26 days 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.959
 and that's what I wanted to say 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.629
 Adam still look under these things 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.310
 which included through the diodes then remember 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.530
 yes checked this figovinu 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.250
 here is such another construction all of them 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.959
 have already gone the distance this here 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:06.069
 move on to this diagram again 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.520
 that is, according to statements, I forgot it 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.590
 already 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.450
 Sokolovsky and Mishon, but that means nothing 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.610
 I do not know that's how I kind of withdraw 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.609
 talked to even pointed this scheme 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:25.300
 mean with 3 volts dc 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:29.169
 ran so here ran into the diode and then 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.660
 theoretically supposedly from minus came here 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:37.660
 part of the energy must be through the diode 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.669
 pass part of the energy goes into minus but 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.360
 when she goes here here he is not her 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.860
 lets supposedly does not let but as we see 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.150
 This thing is a long time ago 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.919
 discharged and there are currents in the diodes 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.720
 leak that is when voltage when 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.500
 positively charged particles run along 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 this wire 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.390
 they partially run through a light diode and 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.789
 partially go through leakage currents over here 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.180
 so 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:13.510
 diodes quickly discharge them that's all 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.960
 there's a fake ruined that's all it's not 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:20.289
 this thought came a little later a long long time 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.030
 I did not drive him in the head and I understood why 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:29.650
 the diodes are faster discharged then well 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:34.260
 Here passes it burns well, that's the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.820
 is burning but I immediately tell you this thing 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.500
 he just saved energy from the very 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.450
 start here just some kind of 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.520
 neponyatka well that's all thanks for 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.509
 Attention 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:52.050
 here waiting for your kids comments 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:56.789
 comments by the way I was asked about 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.039
 the fact that the LED supposedly there 20 30 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.379
 milliamps consumes the very beginning 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.490
 experiment was able to revise the most 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:08.610
 the first video clips of them attaching below 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.060
 consumption was six milliamps here 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.819
 Well, to the extent that they are working with them 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.680
 each time dimmer dimmer dimmer 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.270
 work that is the amount of milliamps a 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.490
 not consume less and less and 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:27.930
 less here that there is still some question 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:31.520
 asked about cooking brewed means 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.099
 salty water then narrowed then 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.509
 washed and 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:42.169
 bullshit is bullshit that 's all thank you 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.169
 for your attention
