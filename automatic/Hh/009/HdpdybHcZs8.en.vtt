next you can install low poly count Team
Fortress<00:00:54.090> 2<00:00:54.360> models<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> few

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Fortress 2 models there are a few

Fortress 2 models there are a few
different<00:00:55.530> types<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.829> models<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
different types of models you can

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
different types of models you can
install<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> best<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
install but the best one that I think is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
install but the best one that I think is
the<00:00:58.680> old-school<00:00:59.280> poly<00:00:59.699> count<00:00:59.969> pack<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the old-school poly count pack this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
the old-school poly count pack this
replaces<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> models<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> game<00:01:02.219> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
replaces all the models in the game with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
replaces all the models in the game with
a<00:01:02.609> lower<00:01:02.940> poly<00:01:03.270> count<00:01:03.539> model<00:01:03.930> counterpart

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
a lower poly count model counterpart

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
a lower poly count model counterpart
this<00:01:04.860> makes<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> easier<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> computer<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this makes it easier on the computer to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
this makes it easier on the computer to
be<00:01:06.390> able<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.780> process<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> graphics<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
be able to process the graphics this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.920 
be able to process the graphics this
along<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> particle<00:01:09.450> removers<00:01:09.900> are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
along with the particle removers are

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
along with the particle removers are
probably<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> best<00:01:11.100> things<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
probably the best things you can do to

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
probably the best things you can do to
be<00:01:12.210> able<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.450> improve<00:01:12.840> frames<00:01:13.260> per<00:01:13.500> second<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
be able to improve frames per second in

the<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.390> big<00:01:15.750> difference<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the other big difference that you can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.010 
the other big difference that you can
make<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.979> using<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.430> FPS<00:01:17.970> config<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
make is using an FPS config now there is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
make is using an FPS config now there is

and<00:02:19.750> shuts<00:02:20.350> them<00:02:20.560> off<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.100> your<00:02:21.250> computer<00:02:21.430> is

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790

other<00:02:26.260> thing<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.830> recommend<00:02:26.950> doing<00:02:27.400> is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
other thing I can recommend doing is

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.790 
other thing I can recommend doing is
upgrading<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.360> motherboards<00:02:28.960> bios<00:02:29.440> if<00:02:29.710> you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
upgrading your motherboards bios if you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.440 
upgrading your motherboards bios if you
don't<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.460> I'm<00:02:30.580> talking<00:02:31.000> about<00:02:31.090> then

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
don't know what I'm talking about then

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.840 
don't know what I'm talking about then
maybe<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:32.050> ignore<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.710> step<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.490> if<00:02:33.670> you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
maybe just ignore this step but if you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.700 
maybe just ignore this step but if you
haven't<00:02:34.090> upgraded<00:02:34.360> your<00:02:34.780> BIOS<00:02:35.140> here's<00:02:35.500> your

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
haven't upgraded your BIOS here's your

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.010 
haven't upgraded your BIOS here's your
reminder<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.460> upgrade<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.540> might<00:02:37.750> give

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
reminder to upgrade it as it might give

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.830 
reminder to upgrade it as it might give
you<00:02:38.170> CPU<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:38.740> GPU<00:02:39.010> performance<00:02:39.730> boosts<00:02:40.570> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
you CPU or GPU performance boosts so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.000 
you CPU or GPU performance boosts so
that<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.080> pretty<00:02:41.260> much<00:02:41.380> everything<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.860> can

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
that is pretty much everything I can

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.740 
that is pretty much everything I can
recommend<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.640> terms<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:43.060> making<00:02:43.420> your<00:02:43.540> Team
