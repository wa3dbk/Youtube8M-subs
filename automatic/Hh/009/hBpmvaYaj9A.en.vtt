00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
locked these other two motors will

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
locked these other two motors will
operate<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.369> lean<00:01:24.000> them

forward<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> backward<00:01:35.659> adjustment<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> we're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
forward and backward adjustment so we're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.469

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
vehicle okay here's the way we did it

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.789 
vehicle okay here's the way we did it
just<00:01:52.619> work<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:54.409> there's<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> cable

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
just work that out there's a cable

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.300 
just work that out there's a cable
behind<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.490> rubber<00:01:56.939> cover

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420 

this<00:02:04.310> was<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.550> little<00:02:04.850> awkward<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.280> them

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
this was a little awkward the of them

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.770 
this was a little awkward the of them
came<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.820> easy<00:02:11.770> there<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.840> see

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
came out easy there it is you can see

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
came out easy there it is you can see
sorry<00:02:17.780> about<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.140> lights<00:02:21.820> maybe<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.940> little

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
sorry about the lights maybe a little

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:34.479 
sorry about the lights maybe a little
better<00:02:23.300> light<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
better light so you can see the the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.050 
better light so you can see the the
cable<00:02:34.940> loose<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:37.070> would<00:02:37.250> just<00:02:37.280> slide<00:02:37.700> out

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
cable loose and it would just slide out

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.509 
cable loose and it would just slide out
of<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:40.160> off<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.670> which<00:02:41.239> look<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.959> so

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
of there off so which look like that so

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840 
of there off so which look like that so
we'll<00:02:43.519> put<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.820> back<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:46.220> we'll<00:02:46.370> retract

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
we'll put it back in and we'll retract

00:02:46.850 --> 00:03:34.559 
we'll put it back in and we'll retract
that<00:02:46.940> one

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.349 

so<00:03:35.569> that's<00:03:35.870> basically<00:03:36.409> how<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.769> do<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.359> on

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
so that's basically how you do it on

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.740 
so that's basically how you do it on
these<00:03:38.829> boards<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.189> that<00:03:41.180> should<00:03:41.420> be<00:03:41.569> locked

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
these boards and that should be locked

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.610 
these boards and that should be locked
in<00:03:42.049> place<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:43.370> problem<00:03:43.849> is<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.329> put<00:03:44.620> these

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
in place the problem is if we put these

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.819 
in place the problem is if we put these
back<00:03:45.950> in<00:03:47.769> some<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.930> doubtful<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.650> these

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
back in some it's doubtful that these

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.920 
back in some it's doubtful that these
are<00:03:52.040> going<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.310> slide<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:53.690> how<00:03:53.870> you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
are going to slide that's how you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.979 
are going to slide that's how you
retract<00:03:54.409> those<00:03:54.650> seats<00:03:55.659> when<00:03:56.659> they're<00:03:56.810> locked

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
retract those seats when they're locked

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.770 
retract those seats when they're locked
in<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:58.000> don't<00:03:59.000> know<00:03:59.120> if<00:03:59.180> we<00:03:59.299> had<00:03:59.420> a<00:03:59.450> switch

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
in I don't know if we had a switch

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.509 
in I don't know if we had a switch
problem<00:04:00.319> we<00:04:00.439> don't<00:04:00.620> have<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.950> time<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.310> figure

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
problem we don't have the time to figure

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.140 
problem we don't have the time to figure
it<00:04:01.639> out

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
it out

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.110 
it out
we'll<00:04:02.510> get<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.930> switch<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.939> change<00:04:04.939> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
we'll get the switch and change the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.610 
we'll get the switch and change the
switch<00:04:05.329> out<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:05.930> if<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.200> makes<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
switch out and see if that makes it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.179 
switch out and see if that makes it
different<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:07.700> seat<00:04:07.970> would<00:04:08.150> go<00:04:08.359> forward<00:04:08.629> only

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
different the seat would go forward only

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.309 
different the seat would go forward only
it<00:04:10.189> wouldn't<00:04:10.579> retract<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.329> as<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.989> can<00:04:12.139> see

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
it wouldn't retract and as you can see

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.250 
it wouldn't retract and as you can see
both<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:13.030> worm<00:04:14.030> gears<00:04:14.329> are<00:04:14.510> operational

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
both of the worm gears are operational

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.289 
both of the worm gears are operational
and<00:04:15.579> so<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.340> fix<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.519> we're<00:04:19.699> working

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
and so this is a fix that we're working

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.080 
and so this is a fix that we're working
on<00:04:20.570> right<00:04:20.810> now<00:04:20.840> for<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.410> car<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:22.010> then<00:04:22.910> we'll

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
on right now for this car and then we'll

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.330 
on right now for this car and then we'll
try<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.539> new<00:04:23.780> another<00:04:24.199> switch<00:04:24.650> when<00:04:24.889> we<00:04:25.010> can<00:04:25.190> get

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
try a new another switch when we can get

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.170 
try a new another switch when we can get
one<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.849> see<00:04:26.720> if<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.610> actually<00:04:28.610> makes<00:04:29.060> it

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
one and see if that actually makes it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
one and see if that actually makes it
operate<00:04:29.570> forward<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.110> backwards<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:30.710> that's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
operate forward and backwards but that's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.600 
operate forward and backwards but that's
basically<00:04:31.789> how<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.479> works<00:04:32.539> I<00:04:33.130> just<00:04:34.130> wanted

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
basically how this works I just wanted

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.740 
basically how this works I just wanted
to<00:04:34.699> show<00:04:34.849> that<00:04:35.199> thanks<00:04:36.199> for<00:04:36.260> watching
