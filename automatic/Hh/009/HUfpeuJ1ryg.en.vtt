00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.740
 frames made with profiles 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.050
 decklink blend the aesthetics of a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.439
 thin profile with an abundance of 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.779
 colors and maximum comfort of heat e 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.689
 all this with the maximum continuum 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.699
 attention to the environment light and space 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.580
 are the central themes in modern homes 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.890
 from which more and more doors and windows are derived 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.800
 wide and sturdy but our windows 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.260
 they must also protect us and oppose the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.989
 more extreme weather conditions since 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.989
 hot from cold and storms 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.550
 backlink has chosen pvc because it is the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.059
 best insulation material for doors e 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.700
 windows to be anchored sturdy and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.039
 usable in the largest windows i 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.520
 PVC profiles are further 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.520
 reinforced 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.320
 the internal steel reinforcements are 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.790
 sturdy and durable but they also lead 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.830
 heat and cold 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.710
 for this reason as 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 technically innovator the clinic has 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 developed the innovative technology 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 the inclusion this innovative 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 technology allows the production of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.220
 profiles for windows and doors from very small 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 components and fuses them into a whole 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.660
 robust that forms the foundation 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 of its strength in the body of the profile 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.160
 in the door of the window where the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 sturdiness and the fiber is crucial 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.350
 integral in the pvc profile with the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
 other components in an exclusive 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.509
 pvc reinforcements production process 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.500
 they are installed in the frame combining 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.810
 coextruded steel cables with foamed PVC 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.490
 highly insulating and 100% recyclable 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 percent 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.170
 both exclusive features 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.539
 of technology the intrusion is the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.060
 result of an equally exceptional 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.399
 production technique 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.580
 simultaneously over 260 coils of 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.250
 fiberglass or a 7.5 containing 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.799
 km of cables composed of over a thousand 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 individual strands of fiberglass fill 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.140
 the extrovert the cables are heated 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.810
 calibrated again heated and melted 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.470
 together to form thicker cables or one 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.690
 thin flat cast pvc is pressed 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.420
 in a matrix together with the fiber of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.120
 glass which carefully placed in the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.910
 correct position in every meter of 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 profile the intrusions are present 200 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.500
 thousand of fiberglass a process 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.320
 very similar is used for the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.750
 intrusion heat reinforcement with cables of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.820
 steel and pvc cell 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.030
 in this case the steel cables are 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.430
 coextruded with the PVC profile which 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 is simultaneously filled with del 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.709
 insulating material in cellular pvc 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.140
 both proceedings are the core 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.420
 intrusion technology and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.390
 guarantee dimensional stability e 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.000
 durable strength thanks to 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.470
 intrusion technology is possible 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.140
 obtain thermal insulation 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.720
 excellent pursuing through 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.739
 energy efficiency the beneficial 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.330
 individual and collective intrusion 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.750
 represents sustainability for each 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.540
 home and for the old link environment 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.849
 intrusion building a house 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.680
 sustainable with innovation
