00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
have the traction available so no we're

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
but the revving up we're slowing flows

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
but the revving up we're slowing flows
down<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.870> takes<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> lot<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> discipline
