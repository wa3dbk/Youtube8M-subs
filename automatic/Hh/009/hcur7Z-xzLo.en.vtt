the<00:03:23.609> wing<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:24.180> important<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.810> think<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
the wing is really important I think a

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.569 
the wing is really important I think a
lot<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.319> us<00:03:25.500> messed<00:03:25.829> up<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.160> wing<00:03:26.340> that's

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
lot of us messed up on the wing that's

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.330 
lot of us messed up on the wing that's
what<00:03:26.760> really<00:03:27.000> frustrates<00:03:27.359> us<00:03:27.799> because<00:03:28.799> I

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
what really frustrates us because I

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.920 
what really frustrates us because I
don't<00:03:29.579> know<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.790> wing<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.359> always<00:03:30.569> wanted<00:03:30.780> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
don't know the wing you always wanted to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.680 
don't know the wing you always wanted to
make<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.680> look<00:03:31.859> very<00:03:32.220> sharp<00:03:32.670> one<00:03:33.299> thing<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.630> I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
make it look very sharp one thing that I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.870 
make it look very sharp one thing that I
really<00:03:34.139> really<00:03:34.170> recommend<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:35.010> take<00:03:35.760> your

I'm doing the way

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.020 
I'm doing the way
liner<00:04:25.009> but<00:04:25.220> I'm<00:04:25.280> going<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.490> really<00:04:25.669> try<00:04:25.729> to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
liner but I'm going to really try to

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.450 
liner but I'm going to really try to
what<00:04:26.539> they<00:04:26.659> say<00:04:26.990> usually<00:04:27.259> is<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.949> follow<00:04:28.220> your

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
what they say usually is to follow your

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.939 
what they say usually is to follow your
waterline<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.389> extend<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.259> outwards<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
waterline and extend it outwards and

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.270 
waterline and extend it outwards and
that's<00:04:31.159> how<00:04:31.400> your<00:04:31.580> eyeliner<00:04:31.940> should<00:04:32.270> go<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.349> to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
that's how your eyeliner should go I to

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.890 
that's how your eyeliner should go I to
be<00:04:34.370> honest<00:04:34.669> don't<00:04:35.030> do<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.479> I<00:04:35.690> probably

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
be honest don't do that I probably

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.010 
be honest don't do that I probably
recommend<00:04:36.319> you<00:04:36.590> doing<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.509> but<00:04:38.509> I<00:04:38.539> really

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020

long<00:04:41.810> as<00:04:42.379> a<00:04:42.409> wing<00:04:42.800> liner<00:04:43.009> is<00:04:43.310> not<00:04:43.580> too<00:04:44.000> straight

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
long as a wing liner is not too straight

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.619
