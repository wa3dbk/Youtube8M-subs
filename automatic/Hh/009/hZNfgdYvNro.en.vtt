mtar nothing else grip is always helpful

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
mtar nothing else grip is always helpful
on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> mtar<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.600> mtar<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> huge

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
on the mtar the mtar can have a huge

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
on the mtar the mtar can have a huge
kick<00:01:44.310> when<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> doesn't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.149> grip<00:01:45.450> also

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
kick when it doesn't have the grip also

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
kick when it doesn't have the grip also
with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> muzzle<00:01:46.770> brake<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.610> mtar<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> an<00:01:48.240> SMG

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
with the muzzle brake the mtar is an SMG

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.819 
with the muzzle brake the mtar is an SMG
so<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.259> i<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.649> much

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
so you know so i can have that much

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
so you know so i can have that much
range<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.610> muzzle<00:01:51.000> brake<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.270> needed<00:01:51.659> mostly

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
range so muzzle brake is needed mostly

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.569 
range so muzzle brake is needed mostly
on<00:01:52.409> any<00:01:52.619> SMG<00:01:53.280> um<00:01:54.079> perks<00:01:55.079> i<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:55.770> agility

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
on any SMG um perks i was using agility

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.510 
on any SMG um perks i was using agility
marathon<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.299> place<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.979> quick<00:01:58.979> draw<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
marathon in place of quick draw and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.749 
marathon in place of quick draw and
sleight<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> hand<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.630> use<00:02:00.899> steady<00:02:01.140> aim

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
sleight of hand i also use steady aim

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
sleight of hand i also use steady aim
this<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.270> being<00:02:03.509> why<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:04.500> when<00:02:05.159> you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this this being why because when you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
this this being why because when you
have<00:02:05.399> quick<00:02:05.939> draw<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.780> still<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> aim<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
have quick draw you still have to aim in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.589 
have quick draw you still have to aim in
the<00:02:08.250> people<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> think<00:02:08.940> quick<00:02:09.149> draw<00:02:09.360> over

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the people you think quick draw over

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.510 
the people you think quick draw over
steady<00:02:09.929> aim<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.770> having<00:02:11.039> quick-draw<00:02:11.400> is

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
steady aim not having quick-draw is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.140 
steady aim not having quick-draw is
better<00:02:11.730> because<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.870> have

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
better because if you have

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.960 
better because if you have
draw<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.750> min<00:02:14.049> faster<00:02:14.739> but<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:15.640> steady

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
draw you a min faster but with steady

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.319 
draw you a min faster but with steady
aim<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:17.019> can<00:02:17.200> shoot<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:18.189> off<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.489> bat<00:02:18.670> so

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
aim you can shoot right off the bat so

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.240 
aim you can shoot right off the bat so
all<00:02:19.689> that<00:02:19.750> time<00:02:20.290> even<00:02:20.709> with<00:02:20.829> quick-draw

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
all that time even with quick-draw

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.179 
all that time even with quick-draw
there's<00:02:21.459> still<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.939> min<00:02:22.689> time<00:02:22.959> compared<00:02:23.799> to<00:02:24.069> if

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
there's still a min time compared to if

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.619 
there's still a min time compared to if
you're<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.519> shooting<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.879> gun<00:02:25.030> with<00:02:25.269> hipfire

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
you're just shooting a gun with hipfire

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.229 
you're just shooting a gun with hipfire
also<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.920> steady<00:02:27.220> with<00:02:27.549> steady<00:02:27.819> aim<00:02:27.970> on

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
also kind of steady with steady aim on

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.750 
also kind of steady with steady aim on
the<00:02:28.420> mtar<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.110> almost<00:02:29.439> like<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> laser<00:02:29.950> with

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the mtar it's almost like a laser with

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.539 
the mtar it's almost like a laser with
the<00:02:30.970> hipfire<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:32.099> think<00:02:33.099> about<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.310> if<00:02:33.459> you're

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
the hipfire so think about it if you're

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.089 
the hipfire so think about it if you're
using<00:02:33.819> an<00:02:34.120> avatar<00:02:34.329> with<00:02:34.599> hip<00:02:34.750> fire<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.260> you

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
using an avatar with hip fire and you

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.530 
using an avatar with hip fire and you
right<00:02:36.519> when<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.939> guy<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.329> shoot

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
right when you see the guy you can shoot

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.479 
right when you see the guy you can shoot
that<00:02:38.140> maybe<00:02:38.349> like<00:02:38.560> two<00:02:38.769> bullets<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.189> them<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
that maybe like two bullets in them and

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.940 
that maybe like two bullets in them and
then<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.239> min<00:02:40.480> while<00:02:41.049> continuing<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.739> fire

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
then a min while continuing the fire

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.490 
then a min while continuing the fire
compared<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.849> seeing<00:02:43.239> your<00:02:43.390> enemy<00:02:43.659> aiming<00:02:44.379> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
compared to seeing your enemy aiming and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.289 
compared to seeing your enemy aiming and
firing<00:02:44.650> there's<00:02:45.280> still<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.670> time<00:02:46.060> between

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
firing there's still a time between

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.089 
firing there's still a time between
where<00:02:46.780> he<00:02:46.930> can<00:02:47.139> probably<00:02:47.530> get<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:47.980> way

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
where he can probably get out of the way

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.289 
where he can probably get out of the way
and<00:02:48.340> shoot<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.730> or<00:02:48.970> should<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.879> can

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
and shoot you or should you it's it can

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.530 
and shoot you or should you it's it can
be<00:02:52.420> very<00:02:52.950> time<00:02:53.950> consuming<00:02:54.090> aiming<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.239> and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
be very time consuming aiming in and

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.990 
be very time consuming aiming in and
also<00:02:55.930> aiming<00:02:56.200> at<00:02:56.409> your<00:02:56.560> target<00:02:56.939> compared<00:02:57.939> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
also aiming at your target compared to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.539 
also aiming at your target compared to
just<00:02:58.239> firing<00:02:58.959> like<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.379> madman<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.159> then

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
just firing like a madman and then

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.490 
just firing like a madman and then
aiming<00:03:00.939> in<00:03:01.090> we're<00:03:01.930> seeing<00:03:02.109> you<00:03:02.200> might<00:03:02.349> get<00:03:02.470> a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
aiming in we're seeing you might get a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
kind of works really well together

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.800 
kind of works really well together
because<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.430> like<00:03:18.609> it's<00:03:19.090> almost<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.510> um

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
because it's like it's almost like um

what<00:03:20.709> am<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.859> trying<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.129> think<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.400> what's<00:03:21.849> that

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
what am I trying to think of what's that

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.360 
what am I trying to think of what's that
in<00:03:22.030> perk<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.359> makes<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.660> move<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.739> stalker

in perk that makes you move a stalker

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.800 
in perk that makes you move a stalker
it's<00:03:24.819> kind<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.030> like<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.329> if<00:03:25.449> you<00:03:25.599> move

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
it's kind of like that if you move

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.409 
it's kind of like that if you move
faster<00:03:26.230> than<00:03:26.260> your<00:03:26.440> enemy<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.489> enemies

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
faster than your enemy the enemies

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.089 
faster than your enemy the enemies
usually<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.079> tend<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.590> have<00:03:29.769> high

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
usually don't tend to have high

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.740 
usually don't tend to have high
sensitivity<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:31.000> they'll<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.329> low

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
sensitivity so they'll have low

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.089 
sensitivity so they'll have low
sensitivities<00:03:32.349> they<00:03:32.440> won't<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.680> able<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.919> keep

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
sensitivities they won't be able to keep

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.099 
sensitivities they won't be able to keep
with<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.000> if<00:03:34.090> you're<00:03:34.209> moving<00:03:34.569> kind<00:03:34.989> of

with you so if you're moving kind of

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.420

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
way more often just just think about

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.260 
way more often just just think about
that<00:05:00.319> also<00:05:00.740> your<00:05:01.039> mindset<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.729> have<00:05:02.060> awareness

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
that also your mindset I have awareness

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.350 
that also your mindset I have awareness
but<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.930> usually<00:05:03.259> do<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.710> tend<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.250> look<00:05:05.120> left

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
but I usually do is I tend to look left

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.870 
but I usually do is I tend to look left
right<00:05:05.509> behind<00:05:06.470> left<00:05:06.830> right<00:05:07.159> behind<00:05:07.550> left

kind<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.120> keeps<00:05:11.270> me<00:05:11.509> from<00:05:11.720> dying<00:05:12.110> from<00:05:12.500> all

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
kind of keeps me from dying from all

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.580
