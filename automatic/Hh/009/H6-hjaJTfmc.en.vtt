00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.340
 this edge of the line should be further 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.779
 starting to twist 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.779

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.250
 So 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.250

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:58.250

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:08.950

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:08.950

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:22.320
