00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
there and when we double-click on it I'm

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.620 
there and when we double-click on it I'm
maybe<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.470> trying<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.070> run<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> oh<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.299> guess

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
maybe it's trying to run it oh I guess

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899 
maybe it's trying to run it oh I guess
it<00:01:57.810> gives<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> executable<00:01:58.729> permissions<00:01:59.729> when

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it gives it executable permissions when

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.389 
it gives it executable permissions when
you<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> automatically<00:02:01.020> adds<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.799> your

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you do that automatically adds your your

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
you do that automatically adds your your
little<00:02:02.939> header<00:02:03.149> they're<00:02:03.390> saying<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
little header they're saying that it's a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039 
little header they're saying that it's a
script<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:06.090> nice<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> creates

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
script so that's nice that it creates

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.690 
script so that's nice that it creates
that<00:02:07.200> script<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.039> seems<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> make<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030 

there<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.160> go<00:02:44.310> okay<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.900> now<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.500> go

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
there we go okay so now we can go

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.620 
there we go okay so now we can go
through<00:02:47.340> here<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.060> wanted<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.420> add<00:02:48.600> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
through here and if we wanted to add a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.100 
through here and if we wanted to add a
shortcut<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.950> these<00:02:50.959> let's<00:02:51.959> say<00:02:52.080> we

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
shortcut to one of these let's say we

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.660 
shortcut to one of these let's say we
want<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.350> err<00:02:52.500> shortcut<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.070> our<00:02:53.190> web<00:02:53.400> browser

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
want to err shortcut to our web browser

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.900 
want to err shortcut to our web browser
we<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.120> click<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.780> click<00:02:54.930> add<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
we can click that we can click add and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.850 
we can click that we can click add and
there<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:57.150> we<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> shortcut<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.170> our<00:02:58.680> web

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
there now we have a shortcut to our web

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.100 
there now we have a shortcut to our web
browser<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.520> loads<00:02:59.730> very<00:03:00.000> fast<00:03:00.360> there<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
browser that loads very fast there the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
browser that loads very fast there the
reason<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.440> probably<00:03:01.680> took<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.890> second

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
reason this probably took a second

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.020 
reason this probably took a second
openings<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.610> probably<00:03:02.730> had<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
openings because it probably had to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.880 
openings because it probably had to
generate<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.660> list<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.260> installed

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
generate this list of installed

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.980 
generate this list of installed
applications<00:03:05.730> since<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.209> constantly

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
applications since it's constantly

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.110 
applications since it's constantly
changing<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.620> add<00:03:07.800> remove<00:03:08.220> programs<00:03:08.280> it's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
changing as you add remove programs it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.400 
changing as you add remove programs it's
got<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.390> do<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.930> fly<00:03:10.080> there<00:03:12.170> next<00:03:13.170> thing

do a tutorial on in the future autostart
scripts<00:04:33.350> this<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.620> important<00:04:34.040> if<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:34.850> want<00:04:35.090> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
scripts this is important if you want a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.140 
scripts this is important if you want a
program<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.110> script<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.830> run<00:04:37.040> when<00:04:37.760> the

program or a script to run when the
computer<00:04:38.330> starts<00:04:38.510> up<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.650> where<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.950> put

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
computer starts up this is where you put

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.390 
computer starts up this is where you put
it<00:04:41.440> right<00:04:42.440> here<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:42.770> can<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:43.070> there's<00:04:43.220> four

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
it right here you can see there's four

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.950 
it right here you can see there's four
things<00:04:43.610> on<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.820> list<00:04:43.850> one<00:04:44.120> has<00:04:44.240> an<00:04:44.360> X<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.840> so

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
things on the list one has an X to it so

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.150 
things on the list one has an X to it so
I'm<00:04:45.020> assuming<00:04:45.110> there's<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> issue<00:04:45.830> with<00:04:46.010> that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
I'm assuming there's a issue with that

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.490 
I'm assuming there's a issue with that
but<00:04:47.120> we're<00:04:47.660> using<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.110> LX<00:04:48.590> panel<00:04:48.950> now<00:04:49.040> LX<00:04:49.520> is

but we're using the LX panel now LX is
another<00:04:51.500> desktop<00:04:51.800> environment<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.310> we're

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
another desktop environment but we're

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.830 
another desktop environment but we're
just<00:04:52.490> using<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.940> panel<00:04:53.300> from<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.690> and

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
that's the panel down here which I'm

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.379 
that's the panel down here which I'm
going<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.130> do<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> whole<00:04:55.460> tutorial<00:04:55.820> on<00:04:56.090> here

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389

giving<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.520> full<00:05:01.669> tutorials<00:05:02.419> later<00:05:02.540> on<00:05:03.820> this

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
giving you full tutorials later on this

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.580 
giving you full tutorials later on this
is<00:05:04.940> basically<00:05:05.300> starting<00:05:05.720> up<00:05:05.840> your<00:05:05.990> wallpaper

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
is basically starting up your wallpaper

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.560 
is basically starting up your wallpaper
and<00:05:07.010> icon<00:05:07.430> your<00:05:07.669> desktop<00:05:07.729> which<00:05:08.540> is<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:09.250> running

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
and icon your desktop which is a running

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.670 
and icon your desktop which is a running
basically<00:05:11.570> your<00:05:11.690> file<00:05:11.960> manager<00:05:12.410> is<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:12.560> charge

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
basically your file manager is in charge

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.379 
basically your file manager is in charge
of<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:14.470> this<00:05:15.470> will<00:05:15.650> automatically<00:05:16.400> runs

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
of that and this will automatically runs

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.629 
of that and this will automatically runs
in<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.600> background<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.950> mounts<00:05:19.100> devices

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
in the background and it mounts devices

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.190 
in the background and it mounts devices
so<00:05:19.729> if<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.880> plug<00:05:20.030> in<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.240> USB<00:05:20.600> Drive<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.110> will

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
so if you plug in a USB Drive it will

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.570 
so if you plug in a USB Drive it will
automatically<00:05:21.740> mail<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.250> those<00:05:22.400> are<00:05:22.550> the

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
automatically mail so those are the

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.700 
automatically mail so those are the
three<00:05:22.669> things<00:05:23.060> very<00:05:23.840> short<00:05:24.169> list<00:05:24.350> here<00:05:24.590> which

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
three things very short list here which

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.230 
three things very short list here which
is<00:05:24.800> good<00:05:24.950> less<00:05:25.100> things<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.460> there<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:26.030> better

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
is good less things in there the better

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.790 
is good less things in there the better
really<00:05:26.660> but<00:05:26.810> if<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.990> want<00:05:27.200> something<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.590> run

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
really but if you want something to run

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.250 
really but if you want something to run
at<00:05:28.040> startup<00:05:28.430> when<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.330> desktop<00:05:29.840> starts<00:05:30.140> up

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
at startup when the desktop starts up

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.750 
at startup when the desktop starts up
not<00:05:30.410> necessarily<00:05:30.770> when<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:30.979> system<00:05:31.190> starting

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
not necessarily when the system starting

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.719 
not necessarily when the system starting
up<00:05:31.990> this<00:05:32.990> is<00:05:33.229> where<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.890> can<00:05:34.070> add<00:05:34.130> it<00:05:34.490> you<00:05:34.580> can

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
up this is where you can add it you can

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.540 
up this is where you can add it you can
click<00:05:35.000> add<00:05:35.229> any<00:05:36.229> type<00:05:36.440> in<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.740> application

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
click add any type in the application

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.080 
click add any type in the application
and<00:05:37.789> any<00:05:38.270> comments<00:05:38.780> on<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.700> if<00:05:40.700> you<00:05:40.850> choose

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
and any comments on it and if you choose

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.500 
and any comments on it and if you choose
one<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.479> can<00:05:41.600> click<00:05:41.810> configuration<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:43.510> you

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
one you can click configuration and you

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.060 
one you can click configuration and you
can<00:05:44.660> actually<00:05:44.810> see<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.380> guess<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:45.860> want<00:05:46.010> to

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
can actually see I guess you want to

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.469 
can actually see I guess you want to
click<00:05:46.190> on<00:05:46.280> one<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:46.880> is<00:05:47.000> your<00:05:47.120> auto<00:05:47.240> start

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
click on one this is your auto start

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.590 
click on one this is your auto start
script<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:47.870> basically<00:05:48.410> this<00:05:49.250> is<00:05:49.610> creating<00:05:50.450> a

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
script so basically this is creating a

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.779 
script so basically this is creating a
shell<00:05:51.200> script<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:51.770> loads<00:05:51.919> at<00:05:52.100> start<00:05:52.340> time<00:05:52.610> so

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
shell script it loads at start time so

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.080 
shell script it loads at start time so
you<00:05:52.880> can<00:05:52.940> manually<00:05:53.330> edit<00:05:53.660> this<00:05:53.810> as<00:05:54.020> well<00:05:54.850> so<00:05:55.850> I

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
you can manually edit this as well so I

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.400 
you can manually edit this as well so I
would<00:05:56.330> do<00:05:56.419> one<00:05:56.570> or<00:05:56.690> other<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:56.960> wouldn't<00:05:57.350> be

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
would do one or other I wouldn't be

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.219 
would do one or other I wouldn't be
bouncing<00:05:57.740> back<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.039> forth<00:05:58.130> between<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.639> two

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
bouncing back and forth between the two

computer savvy at all I mean it's just

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.969 
computer savvy at all I mean it's just
an<00:06:29.060> XML<00:06:29.419> file<00:06:29.690> so<00:06:29.960> it's<00:06:30.110> a<00:06:30.169> tagging<00:06:30.590> language

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
an XML file so it's a tagging language

you should if you've never messed with

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.149 
you should if you've never messed with
it<00:06:32.840> before<00:06:32.930> if<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:33.200> look<00:06:33.380> at<00:06:33.560> it<00:06:33.590> you<00:06:34.010> should

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
it before if you look at it you should

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.529 
it before if you look at it you should
be<00:06:34.250> able<00:06:34.310> to<00:06:34.430> figure<00:06:34.550> out<00:06:34.820> how<00:06:34.970> it<00:06:35.120> works<00:06:35.300> but

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
be able to figure out how it works but

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.450 
be able to figure out how it works but
I'll<00:06:35.659> might<00:06:36.020> do<00:06:36.289> it<00:06:36.440> or<00:06:36.710> have<00:06:37.010> time<00:06:37.159> on<00:06:37.340> that

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
I'll might do it or have time on that

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.830 
I'll might do it or have time on that
