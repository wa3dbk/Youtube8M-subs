00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 the Pharisees and the Sadducees approached 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 of Jesus and put him to the test by asking him 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.840
 that would show them a sign from heaven he 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.699
 replied when the afternoon comes you say 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 It's going to be a long time since the sky is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.650
 red and morning today have the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.220
 storm after the sky is red and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220
 cloudy 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.420
 You know how to interpret the aspect of the sky. 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 but they can not interpret the signs of the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 times a perverse and adulterous generation 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:59.719
 asks for a miraculous sign but none will be 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:59.719
 given but the sign of jonas 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.990
 Jesus left us and retired in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.350
 of the disciples to the other side of the sea 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.149
 forgot to bring bread if they are 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.369
 attentively told them jesus and have 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.869
 beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:36.039
 and they discussed each other. 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.800
 saying it 's because we did not bring bread 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:42.280
 realizing the discussion jesus 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.350
 asked men of little faith why 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.550
 you are arguing with each other about 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.950
 not having bread still do not understand not 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.679
 remember the five loaves for the five thousand 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.929
 and how many baskets you have collected 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:01.299
 of the seven loaves to the four thousand and how much 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:03.280
 baskets collected how come you do not 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.920
 understand that it was not bread I 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.300
 was talking 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.270
 be careful with yeast from the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.489
 Pharisees and his followers then understood 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.700
 that I was not telling them to take 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.190
 beware of bread yeast but with the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.190
 teaching of the Pharisees seduction of the heavens 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.730
 Jesus came to the region of Caesarea from 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.010
 Philip asked his disciples 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.019
 who the others say that the son of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.500
 man is they answer some say 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.660
 It is John the Baptist, and yet 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:53.780
 others 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:57.030
 jeremiah or one of the prophets and you 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.440
 he asked 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.440
 who do you say I am 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.790
 Simon Peter replied you are the Christ 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.790
 Son of the living god 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:33.080
 answered jesus happy are you Simon son 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.700
 because this was not revealed 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.980
 by flesh and blood but by my father who 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.099
 it's in the skies 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.640
 and I tell you that you are Pedro and about 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.870
 this stone I will build my church and 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.910
 the doors of hades can not win there 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.910
 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.120
 What you call on earth will have been 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.500
 connected in the skies and what you hang up in 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.680
 earth will have been turned off in the skies 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.660
 then he warned his disciples that 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.140
 did not tell anyone that he was the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.140
 Christ 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.639
 from that moment Jesus began to 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.109
 explain to his disciples that he was 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.350
 necessary for him to go to jerusalem 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.590
 and suffered many things in the hands of 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:33.080
 religious leaders of the chief priests 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:37.270
 and of the teachers of the law and to be slain and 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.270
 resuscitate if on the third day 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.669
 Then Pedro calling him started 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.110
 rebuke him say lord this never 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.410
 will happen 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.830
 jesus saw himself said there is fear behind 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.830
 I satan 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:04.949
 you're a stumbling block to me and 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.459
 does not think of the things of God but of the 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.459
 men 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.390
 Then Jesus said to his disciples 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:25.530
 if anyone wants to accompany me 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:28.600
 let him take up his cross and follow me. 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.860
 because who wants to save his life to 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:37.020
 lose and whoever loses his life for 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.020
 my cause will find it 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:46.300
 because it will advance the man to gain the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.730
 whole world and lose your soul or 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.040
 that man can give in exchange for his 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.980
 soul, for the Son of Man will come 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.810
 glory of his father with his angels and 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.070
 then reward each one according to 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.070
 What have you done? 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.520
 I assure you that some of the people here 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.289
 find 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.180
 not experience a death before 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.599
 see the son of man coming in his 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.599
 Kingdom 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.430
 Hmm
