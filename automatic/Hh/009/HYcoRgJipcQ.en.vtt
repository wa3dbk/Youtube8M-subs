00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 This is especially true is the inliner drive 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.320
 much faster 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.060
 Professionals like the gate make it easy 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.549
 the polyphony of 50 to 60 kilometers per hour 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.929
 but of course they hurt me 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.349
 Tricks in stock 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.349
 Exercise also makes the master here 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.800
 There are no deadlines, especially since he is in Lima 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 I had to play my major role in getting these complaints Steinfurt 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 and now has to workout 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.740
 Wiesberger the crossbar 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.220
 the most important thing now is not the time i'm thanks 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.320
 he is only now have no substitute 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 Prorektor LIEBLANG does not do so 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.980
 how beautiful i must be as wrong so it is two ways to slow down the 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.260
 first artist rinsed as when skiing braking adjusts the check digit 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.790
 for me as well as a v 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 as he way that is approx 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210
 Merz 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.689
 important for this is my title favorite and is just the back door 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.900
 and I do not care 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.880
 at least if you do not drive too fast, it is his fault 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 Well 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.229
 then have 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.369
 Fritzlar Gallen 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.480
 Dominik Hammerstein 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 However, it could be that we also have an end 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 Ballack himself 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190
 because of a 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 me too of course 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.180
 preventively active 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.720
 to have a win of the championship 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.200
 important is therefore required 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.370
 us coach Bob Bradley Smith translate from Torsten Wewer 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 No laughs 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 but many others too 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.869
 it emblazoned 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 9 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.860
 Now let's see who of us both had better taken care of the 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.819
 Of course, boys and girls on the racetrack have plenty of space 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 four 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.189
 it was 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.720
 now he does not have to spend a whole day 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.629
 he has the 1 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.629
 the white line 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 Goar 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.630
 I can 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.680
 No 7 Fiat can
