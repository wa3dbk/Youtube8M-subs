management platform okay okay so explain
k2<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:43.530> where<00:00:44.040> does<00:00:44.280> kaseya<00:00:44.640> mobile<00:00:45.059> come<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
k2 now where does kaseya mobile come in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
k2 now where does kaseya mobile come in
well<00:00:46.200> Kaseya<00:00:46.620> mobile<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.160> extension<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
well Kaseya mobile is an extension of it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
well Kaseya mobile is an extension of it
right<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.750> look<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.110> there's<00:00:49.530> there's<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
right so if we look at there's there's a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
right so if we look at there's there's a
way<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> manage<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> access<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> system

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
way to manage and access the system

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.160 
way to manage and access the system

have a browser you can access it there
one<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> things<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.109> wanted<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.710> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
one of the things we wanted to do with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.420 
one of the things we wanted to do with
Taylor<00:01:02.489> specific<00:01:03.149> applications<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.860> phone

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Taylor specific applications for phone

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670 
Taylor specific applications for phone
use<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> browser

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
use because there's you know the browser

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.840 
use because there's you know the browser
is<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.450> really<00:01:09.930> needs<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.470> be

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
is little so it really needs to be

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
is little so it really needs to be
oriented<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> screen<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.680> lot

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
oriented to the screen and there's a lot

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
oriented to the screen and there's a lot
of<00:01:13.890> things<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> iphone<00:01:14.970> give<00:01:15.270> us<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
of things that the iphone give us in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
of things that the iphone give us in
building<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.470> application<00:01:17.119> especially<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
building an application especially as a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.690 
building an application especially as a
service<00:01:18.990> desk<00:01:19.280> extension<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
service desk extension which is the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270 
service desk extension which is the
first<00:01:20.939> piece<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> say<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> mobile<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.740> really

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
first piece of say a mobile that really

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
first piece of say a mobile that really
lets<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.880> usable<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> functional<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
lets it be usable and functional for the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
lets it be usable and functional for the
user<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> suite<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.330> Casilla

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
user so this will be a suite of Casilla

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.410 
user so this will be a suite of Casilla
mobile<00:01:28.259> applications<00:01:28.829> yeah<00:01:29.549> kassam<00:01:29.970> mobile

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
mobile applications yeah kassam mobile

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.170 
mobile applications yeah kassam mobile
is<00:01:30.840> essentially<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> platform<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> which<00:01:32.939> we

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
is essentially the platform of which we

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
is essentially the platform of which we
can<00:01:33.390> build<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.840> their<00:01:33.990> applications<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
can build up their applications so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.429 
can build up their applications so
things<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.520> asset<00:01:36.060> management<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
things like asset management or a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.280 
things like asset management or a
control<00:01:38.400> management<00:01:39.000> screen<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:39.960> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
control management screen so you can do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.330 
control management screen so you can do
various<00:01:40.770> things<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:42.060> machines<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
various things to machines and the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.850 
various things to machines and the
settings<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:44.970> Kaseya<00:01:45.450> server
