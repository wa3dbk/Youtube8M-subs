00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
chapters and he's the expert but you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
chapters and he's the expert but you
might<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.059> interested<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.660> his<00:01:00.780> conclusion

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the creative world and he says the best

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
the creative world and he says the best
way<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> put<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.659> two<00:01:27.869> things<00:01:28.020> together<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
way to put these two things together is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
way to put these two things together is
what<00:01:28.860> he<00:01:29.009> calls<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> theory<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> theistic

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
what he calls the theory of theistic

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
what he calls the theory of theistic
evolution<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.200> he<00:01:31.259> doesn't<00:01:31.500> really

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
evolution now he doesn't really

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.870 
evolution now he doesn't really
understand<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.310> theory<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.390> means<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
understand what theory really means but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.050 
understand what theory really means but
the<00:01:35.880> notion<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> theistic<00:01:36.689> evolution

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the notion of theistic evolution

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.380 
the notion of theistic evolution
theistic<00:01:39.060> evolution<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:41.729> notion<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
theistic evolution is this notion that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.520 
theistic evolution is this notion that
God<00:01:43.009> ordained<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> sustained<00:01:45.149> an

clouser is a little bit of his bio there
the<00:03:22.470> reason<00:03:22.740> why<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.860> mentioned<00:03:23.310> him<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.730> that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the reason why I mentioned him is that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.200 
the reason why I mentioned him is that
he<00:03:24.420> wrote<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:25.110> very<00:03:25.560> nice<00:03:26.190> chapter<00:03:26.820> in<00:03:27.030> this

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
he wrote a very nice chapter in this

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.230 
he wrote a very nice chapter in this
book<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.980> MV<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.550> incompatible<00:03:30.030> with

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
book is the MV is incompatible with

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.400 
book is the MV is incompatible with
evolution<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:31.050> he<00:03:31.140> does<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> very

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
evolution I think he does a very

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.820 
evolution I think he does a very
even-handed<00:03:32.400> job<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.910> addressing<00:03:33.210> this<00:03:33.830> from

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
even-handed job of addressing this from

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.390 
even-handed job of addressing this from
a<00:03:35.450> Christian<00:03:36.450> perspective<00:03:37.130> he's<00:03:38.130> not<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
a Christian perspective he's not a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.660 
a Christian perspective he's not a
scientist<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.210> he's<00:03:39.540> like<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.960> philosopher<00:03:40.890> so

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
scientist but he's like a philosopher so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.220 
scientist but he's like a philosopher so
it's<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.910> professor<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> philosophy<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
it's a professor of philosophy and

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
it's a professor of philosophy and
religion<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.070> he's<00:03:44.250> coming<00:03:44.580> at<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.700> from<00:03:44.820> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
religion so he's coming at it from the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.810 
religion so he's coming at it from the
Genesis<00:03:45.510> angle<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.830> chapter<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.490> well

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
Genesis angle and this chapter is well

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.430 
Genesis angle and this chapter is well
worth<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> read<00:03:48.480> I've<00:03:48.750> actually<00:03:48.960> brought<00:03:49.410> a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
worth the read I've actually brought a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.650 
worth the read I've actually brought a
few<00:03:49.770> copies<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.550> photocopy<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.510> also

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
few copies of it photocopy and I also

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.720 
few copies of it photocopy and I also
have<00:03:51.960> it<00:03:52.080> available<00:03:52.140> as<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.710> PDF<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.580> can

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
have it available as a PDF but you can

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.830 
have it available as a PDF but you can
read<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.210> think<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.600> make<00:03:54.750> an

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
read it and I think it would make an

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.330 
read it and I think it would make an
excellent<00:03:54.930> whatever<00:03:55.620> one's<00:03:55.860> take<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
excellent whatever one's take on the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.980 
excellent whatever one's take on the
material<00:03:56.700> tonight<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:57.150> think<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.720> would<00:03:57.840> make

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
material tonight I think it would make

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.490

of what we find in the fossil record i

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.120 
of what we find in the fossil record i
mentioned<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.290> humans<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.800> chimpanzees

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130

numerous numerous other species in the

criteria of other forms of life that are

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.969 
criteria of other forms of life that are
intermediate<00:05:04.210> between<00:05:04.840> what<00:05:05.470> we<00:05:05.590> see<00:05:05.800> in

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
modern humans and modern chimpanzees so

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.540 
modern humans and modern chimpanzees so
you're<00:05:08.440> probably<00:05:08.620> familiar<00:05:08.919> with<00:05:09.190> some<00:05:09.520> of

you're probably familiar with some of

you're probably familiar with some of
them<00:05:09.790> even<00:05:11.940> Neanderthals<00:05:12.940> would<00:05:13.180> be<00:05:13.300> one<00:05:13.510> or

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
them even Neanderthals would be one or

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.510 
them even Neanderthals would be one or
the<00:05:13.810> different<00:05:14.200> australopithecines<00:05:14.979> like

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
that surface yet but those you would

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.730 
that surface yet but those you would
