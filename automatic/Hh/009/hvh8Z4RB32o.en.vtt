this<00:00:56.580> hair<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.150> now<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.689> not<00:00:57.750> saying<00:00:58.559> it's

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
this hair right now I'm not saying it's

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.859 
this hair right now I'm not saying it's
perfect<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.939> not<00:01:00.089> perfect<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.689> does

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
perfect because it's not perfect it does

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.500 
perfect because it's not perfect it does
shed<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:02.339> bit<00:01:02.580> but<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.150> only<00:01:03.239> reason

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
shed a little bit but the only reason

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
shed a little bit but the only reason
why<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.689> think<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> sheds<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
why I think that it sheds is because I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
why I think that it sheds is because I
cut<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> wefts<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> front<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> that's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
cut the wefts in the front and that's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.590 
cut the wefts in the front and that's
like<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> only<00:01:08.369> place<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.420> shedding

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
like the only place that it's shedding

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.539 
like the only place that it's shedding
in<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.439> back<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.829> not<00:01:11.009> really<00:01:11.219> shedding

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
in the back that's not really shedding

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.569 
in the back that's not really shedding
and<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:13.380> am<00:01:13.829> getting<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.219> bit<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
and I am getting a little bit of

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.999 
and I am getting a little bit of
breakage<00:01:14.939> from<00:01:15.409> bleaching<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.770> that's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
breakage from bleaching it but that's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060 
breakage from bleaching it but that's
obviously<00:01:17.780> what<00:01:18.780> comes<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.289> but<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.740> will

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
obviously what comes with it but i will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.919 
obviously what comes with it but i will
keep<00:01:20.549> deep<00:01:20.820> conditioning<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.539> hair<00:01:21.719> and

keep deep conditioning the hair and

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.830
