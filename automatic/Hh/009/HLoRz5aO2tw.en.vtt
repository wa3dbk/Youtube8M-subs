simmer<00:03:05.520> i'm<00:03:05.760> not<00:03:05.940> sure<00:03:06.150> what<00:03:06.300> exactly<00:03:06.660> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
simmer i'm not sure what exactly you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.410 
simmer i'm not sure what exactly you
have<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.230> watch<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:10.550> but<00:03:11.550> then<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.090> may<00:03:12.240> be<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
have to watch it but then it may be a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.260 
have to watch it but then it may be a
little<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.840> darker<00:03:13.880> sometimes<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
little bit darker sometimes you think of

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.760 
little bit darker sometimes you think of
butterscotch<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:15.990> being<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.350> know<00:03:16.440> very<00:03:16.650> very

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
butterscotch is being you know very very

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.980 
butterscotch is being you know very very
pale<00:03:17.220> yellow<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.810> because

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
pale yellow but that's just because

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.390 
pale yellow but that's just because
there's<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.470> little<00:03:19.710> more<00:03:19.830> than<00:03:19.980> last<00:03:20.130> less

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
there's a little more than last less

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.130 
there's a little more than last less
than<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.880> since<00:03:21.060> i<00:03:21.180> made<00:03:21.360> my<00:03:21.720> own<00:03:21.750> brown

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
than this one since i made my own brown

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.300 
than this one since i made my own brown
sugar<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.530> let<00:03:25.710> this<00:03:25.860> cook<00:03:26.070> for<00:03:26.130> a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
sugar so you just let this cook for a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.540 
sugar so you just let this cook for a
while<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:27.360> five<00:03:27.660> minutes<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.310> stir<00:03:29.520> it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
while by five minutes and you stir it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.850 
while by five minutes and you stir it
frequently<00:03:30.480> it's<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> be<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.650> bit

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
frequently it's going to be a little bit

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.700 
frequently it's going to be a little bit
thin<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.210> be<00:03:33.330> very<00:03:33.540> hot<00:03:33.900> but

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
thin this is going to be very hot but

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.710 
thin this is going to be very hot but
when<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.040> cools<00:03:35.250> down<00:03:35.550> it'll<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> little

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
when it cools down it'll be a little

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.470 
when it cools down it'll be a little
thicker<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:38.190> put<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> time<00:03:38.760> around<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.270> five

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
thicker so put the time around for five

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.620 
thicker so put the time around for five
minutes<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:41.490> it's<00:03:41.670> better<00:03:41.820> cook<00:03:42.120> cook<00:03:42.480> away

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
minutes and it's better cook cook away

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.770 
minutes and it's better cook cook away
dirt<00:03:43.560> every<00:03:43.830> once<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> while<00:03:44.570> now<00:03:45.570> we're

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
dirt every once in a while now we're

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.280 
dirt every once in a while now we're
going<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.140> turn<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.790> flame<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.960> has<00:03:49.140> been

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
going to turn the flame it has been

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.010 
going to turn the flame it has been
simmering<00:03:49.560> for<00:03:49.770> five<00:03:50.130> minutes<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:51.020> we're

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
simmering for five minutes and we're

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.950 
simmering for five minutes and we're
going<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.440> add<00:03:52.620> vanilla<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:54.060> mu<00:03:54.570> 2

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
going to add vanilla that is mu 2

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.630 
going to add vanilla that is mu 2
teaspoons<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.620> vanilla<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:58.340> that's<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.520> end

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
teaspoons of vanilla and that's the end

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.570 
teaspoons of vanilla and that's the end
of<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.960> now<00:04:00.960> it's<00:04:01.140> going<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.350> be<00:04:01.500> thin<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:02.070> once

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
of it now it's going to be thin but once

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.670 
of it now it's going to be thin but once
it<00:04:02.730> cools<00:04:02.910> down<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.330> little<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.810> lot<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.380> will<00:04:04.530> be

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it cools down a little a lot it will be

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.820 
it cools down a little a lot it will be
thinner<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.840> we're<00:04:07.020> going<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.320> let<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.590> cool

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
thinner so we're going to let this cool

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.500 
thinner so we're going to let this cool
down<00:04:08.130> see<00:04:08.550> how<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.670> looks<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.270> is<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> little

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
down see how it looks so it is a little

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.130 
down see how it looks so it is a little
bit<00:04:09.810> darker<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.330> pushing<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> that's

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
bit darker just be pushing it that's

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.340 
bit darker just be pushing it that's
what<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.380> looks<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.770> on<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.980> weight<00:04:14.250> plate

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
