00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 with a soy sauce and go red yes we 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 will try to combine Asian cuisine 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 with the red wine g dare you will see 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.429
 it's pretty original there it's really 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.440
 very nice and it's not very complicated to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.980
 to do to their guards we will start with 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.060
 in a saucepan put the soy sauce 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.060
 you will put the red wine 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 if we make them a nice discount 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.640
 it's perfect we'll put sugar for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 bring a little sweetness to the sauce 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 exactly we will put a tiny 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 little ginger cut into chunk 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.469
 because that way we'll be able to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 recover after that agree we go 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 bring to a boil to reduce 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.390
 A half 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.620
 ok agree to our sauce has reduced 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.579
 half and now we're going to tie her up and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.050
 germain with a little bit of that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 vehicle in the back chacha the cold water 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.820
 we have a little bit of corn starch or 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 potato 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.409
 you have not too nice delay too much the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.710
 found too much water and you'll put 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 gradually in the reduction of which 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.570
 mix makes that lÃ©o it's just for 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.729
 one donated but half to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 see what it gives 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.920
 go mix we think you can 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 add greece 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.730
 so I live in starch and we have a 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.020
 only sphere of people waiting 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.680

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.480

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.350
