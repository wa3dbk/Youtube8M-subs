to this and the way we're going to do
that<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> by<00:00:56.820> sliding<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.690> board<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that is by sliding the board and you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
that is by sliding the board and you
actually<00:00:59.430> physically<00:01:00.000> slide<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> board<00:01:01.020> I'm

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
actually physically slide the board I'm

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.889 
actually physically slide the board I'm
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> push<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> blocks<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.750> all

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
going to push up and the blocks are all

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.410 
going to push up and the blocks are all
going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> move<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:07.939> as<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.330> them

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
going to move up as you can see them

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to move up as you can see them
actually<00:01:10.970> pushing<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.740> course<00:01:13.950> you

actually pushing it up and of course you
can<00:01:14.250> push<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.670> four<00:01:14.939> directions<00:01:15.110> here

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
can push it in all four directions here

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.649 
can push it in all four directions here
this<00:01:16.290> push<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> left<00:01:20.090> as<00:01:21.090> well<00:01:21.479> as

this push it to the left as well as
rotate<00:01:24.409> that's<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> cause<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
rotate that's going to cause it to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.960 
rotate that's going to cause it to
rotate<00:01:26.490> 90<00:01:26.850> degrees<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.430> press<00:01:29.700> again
