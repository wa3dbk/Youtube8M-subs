00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.150 

for<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> TV<00:00:02.629> the<00:00:03.629> world<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.290> thinking<00:00:07.160> because

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
for a TV the world is thinking because

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.310 
for a TV the world is thinking because
what<00:00:08.309> happens<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.090> gravity<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.200> black

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
what happens is the gravity of the black

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.240 
what happens is the gravity of the black
hole<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:11.960> extreme<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.710> imagine<00:00:13.799> light

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
hole is extreme as you can imagine light

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.730 
hole is extreme as you can imagine light
doesn't<00:00:14.700> even<00:00:14.820> escape<00:00:15.179> its<00:00:15.839> gravity<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.500> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
doesn't even escape its gravity is so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060 
doesn't even escape its gravity is so
extreme<00:00:17.190> light<00:00:18.119> traveling<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.740> speed<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
extreme light traveling at the speed of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.410 
extreme light traveling at the speed of
light<00:00:20.220> all<00:00:21.090> right

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
light all right

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.230 
light all right
like<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> put<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.070> context<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
like just to put that in context if you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
like just to put that in context if you
wanted<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> escape<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.199> earth<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.830> actually

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
wanted to escape the earth it's actually

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099 
wanted to escape the earth it's actually
possible<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.180> contrary<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> what

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
possible to do that contrary to what

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
possible to do that contrary to what
your<00:00:28.289> grandparents<00:00:28.890> told<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> where<00:00:29.730> they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
your grandparents told you where they

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
your grandparents told you where they
said<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.210> goes<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.539> must<00:00:30.570> come<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:31.019> that's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
said what goes up must come down that's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.659 
said what goes up must come down that's
just<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.340> true

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
just not true

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
just not true
that<00:00:33.630> well<00:00:33.809> there's<00:00:34.200> nothing<00:00:34.590> your

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that well there's nothing your

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
that well there's nothing your
grandparents<00:00:35.250> ever<00:00:35.430> through<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.600> never

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
grandparents ever through that never

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.520 
grandparents ever through that never
came<00:00:37.050> down

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
came down

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
came down
but<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.040> rockets<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.180> high<00:00:39.390> enough<00:00:39.600> speed

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but with rockets with high enough speed

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
but with rockets with high enough speed
you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.620> send<00:00:40.829> something<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> never<00:00:41.520> comes

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you can send something so it never comes

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.500 
you can send something so it never comes
back<00:00:42.050> for<00:00:43.050> earth<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.160> speed<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.760> 7<00:00:45.090> miles<00:00:45.300> per

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
back for earth that speed is 7 miles per

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
back for earth that speed is 7 miles per
second<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.829> call<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> escape

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
second and we call it the escape

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
second and we call it the escape
velocity<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> throw<00:00:48.420> something<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
velocity but if I throw something that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
velocity but if I throw something that
apples<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.649> good<00:00:50.149> if<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.270> throw<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.539> not

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
apples here good if I throw this not

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
apples here good if I throw this not
fast<00:00:52.739> enough<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.280> comes<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.940> most<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
fast enough it comes back so most of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
fast enough it comes back so most of
life<00:00:54.480> experience<00:00:55.020> tells<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.800> goes

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
life experience tells you that what goes

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
life experience tells you that what goes
up<00:00:56.070> comes<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.370> 7<00:00:56.940> miles<00:00:57.090> per<00:00:57.210> second<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
up comes out 7 miles per second this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
up comes out 7 miles per second this
never<00:00:57.840> comes<00:00:57.989> back<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> goes<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> edge<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
never comes back it goes to the edge of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.360 
never comes back it goes to the edge of
the<00:00:59.039> universe<00:00:59.539> there<00:01:00.539> okay<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:01.859> turns<00:01:02.280> out

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the universe there okay so now turns out

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.240 
the universe there okay so now turns out
on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> black<00:01:03.300> hole<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> escape

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on the on a black hole the escape

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.609 
on the on a black hole the escape
velocity<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.909> high<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
velocity is so high that you have to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
velocity is so high that you have to
speed<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> light<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.729> good<00:01:09.000> enough<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.750> if

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
speed of light is not good enough so if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
speed of light is not good enough so if
light<00:01:09.990> doesn't<00:01:10.229> come<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.560> nothing's<00:01:11.250> coming

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
light doesn't come out nothing's coming

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
light doesn't come out nothing's coming
out<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.000> black<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.810> fall<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.680> not

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
out it's black you fall in you're not

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
out it's black you fall in you're not
coming<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> one-way<00:01:14.850> trip<00:01:15.259> okay<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
coming out it's a one-way trip okay so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
coming out it's a one-way trip okay so
if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.640> die<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.150> way<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.570> won't<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
if you die this way you won't get to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.300 
if you die this way you won't get to
tell<00:01:19.290> anyone<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.860> died<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.590> he<00:01:22.680> started

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
tell anyone how you died then he started

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.230 
tell anyone how you died then he started
but<00:01:24.000> second<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.259> fall<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> don't<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
but second as you fall in you don't just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.170 
but second as you fall in you don't just
die<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.840> disappear<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.970> die

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
die because you disappear you you die

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690 
die because you disappear you you die
long<00:01:30.479> before<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.049> disappear<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.040> fall<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
long before you disappear as you fall in

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.230 
long before you disappear as you fall in
the<00:01:33.380> gravity<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.770> feet<00:01:35.240> becomes

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the gravity it's your feet becomes

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480 
the gravity it's your feet becomes
rapidly<00:01:36.840> greater<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> gravity<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.310> your

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
rapidly greater than the gravity at your

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.679 
rapidly greater than the gravity at your
head<00:01:39.619> now<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.670> turns<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
head now now it turns out as if you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.700 
head now now it turns out as if you
stand<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.170> earth<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:44.520> fact<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.090> true<00:01:45.840> under

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
stand on earth that fact is true under

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
stand on earth that fact is true under
those<00:01:46.920> conditions<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.579> well<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.450> your

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
those conditions as well because your

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
those conditions as well because your
feet<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.750> closer<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.439> Earth's<00:01:49.649> center<00:01:49.979> than

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
feet are closer to Earth's center than

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
feet are closer to Earth's center than
the<00:01:50.700> top<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.119> head<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.990> feet

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the top of your head is so your feet

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990 
the top of your head is so your feet
actually<00:01:52.500> feel<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> stronger<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.430> segrete

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
actually feel is stronger for segrete

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
actually feel is stronger for segrete
but<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:55.020> much

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
but not by much

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.560 
but not by much
because<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.299> feet

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
because if you're you know five feet

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
because if you're you know five feet
tall<00:01:57.719> six<00:01:58.020> feet<00:01:58.200> tall<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> earth<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.579> like

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
tall six feet tall and earth is like

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
tall six feet tall and earth is like
four<00:02:00.000> thousand<00:02:00.540> miles<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:01.020> radius<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
four thousand miles in radius that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.999 
four thousand miles in radius that
difference<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.210> great<00:02:04.009> compared

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
difference is not that great compared

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.200 
difference is not that great compared
with<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> distance<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> center<00:02:05.969> there

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
with the distance to the center there

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.410 
with the distance to the center there
black<00:02:06.719> hole<00:02:06.960> they're<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.799> small<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.119> compact

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
black hole they're so small so compact

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
black hole they're so small so compact
that<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.319> height<00:02:10.590> becomes<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.580> height

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that your height becomes your height

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.390 
that your height becomes your height
matter

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
matter

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.330

as<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.450> fall<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:14.019> towards<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.440> black<00:02:14.620> hole<00:02:14.650> so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
as you fall in towards the black hole so

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.330 
as you fall in towards the black hole so
your<00:02:15.610> feet<00:02:15.909> start<00:02:16.360> falling<00:02:17.040> faster<00:02:18.040> than<00:02:18.069> your

your feet start falling faster than your
head<00:02:18.549> does<00:02:19.409> that's<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.590> bad<00:02:20.830> situation<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.580> be

in you don't really know initially you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
in you don't really know initially you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
kind of feel good you know because it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.509 
kind of feel good you know because it's
every<00:02:28.900> all<00:02:29.440> stretch<00:02:29.860> when<00:02:30.129> you<00:02:30.190> wake<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.430> in

every all stretch when you wake up in
the<00:02:30.579> morning<00:02:30.790> initially<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.810> feels<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.440> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the morning initially it feels like a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
the morning initially it feels like a
stretch<00:02:32.829> right<00:02:33.310> sort<00:02:33.549> of<00:02:33.610> general<00:02:33.940> relativity

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
stretch right sort of general relativity

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.690

a<00:02:34.510> kind<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.780> yoga<00:02:35.019> okay<00:02:35.739> two<00:02:36.010> kind<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.310> yoga

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
a kind of yoga okay two kind of yoga

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.920 
a kind of yoga okay two kind of yoga
cosmic<00:02:37.450> yoga's<00:02:38.909> but<00:02:39.909> what<00:02:40.120> happens<00:02:40.569> is<00:02:40.720> that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
cosmic yoga's but what happens is that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.490 
cosmic yoga's but what happens is that
stretch<00:02:41.319> continues<00:02:42.000> beyond<00:02:43.140> comfort<00:02:44.140> levels

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
stretch continues beyond comfort levels

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.420 
stretch continues beyond comfort levels
and<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.720> reach<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.079> point<00:02:47.290> where<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.040> then

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
and you reach a point where and then

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.270 
and you reach a point where and then
call<00:02:48.609> the<00:02:48.730> tidal<00:02:49.120> forces<00:02:49.680> tides<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.099> body

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
call the tidal forces tides on your body

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.190 
call the tidal forces tides on your body
basically<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.060> tidal<00:02:52.420> force<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:52.930> great

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
basically the tidal force can so great

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.819 
basically the tidal force can so great
that<00:02:54.010> they<00:02:54.310> exceed<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.829> intermolecular

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
that they exceed the intermolecular

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.770 
that they exceed the intermolecular
forces<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.120> bind<00:02:58.420> your<00:02:58.810> flesh<00:02:59.109> and<00:03:00.599> so<00:03:01.599> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
forces that bind your flesh and so the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.860 
forces that bind your flesh and so the
point<00:03:02.079> comes<00:03:02.379> where<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.099> snap<00:03:03.970> into<00:03:04.540> two

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
point comes where you snap into two

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.319 
point comes where you snap into two
pieces<00:03:05.549> likely<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.670> happen<00:03:06.819> at<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> base<00:03:07.299> of

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
pieces likely to happen at the base of

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.800 
pieces likely to happen at the base of
your<00:03:07.510> spine<00:03:07.859> now<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:08.920> are<00:03:09.190> two<00:03:09.370> pieces<00:03:09.579> now<00:03:10.060> it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
your spine now you are two pieces now it

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.160 
your spine now you are two pieces now it
turns<00:03:11.079> out<00:03:12.450> now<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> know<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.720> didn't<00:03:14.049> ask

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
turns out now I know you didn't ask

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.570 
turns out now I know you didn't ask
about<00:03:14.379> this<00:03:14.739> but

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
about this but

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.440 
about this but
I<00:03:16.660> got<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> whole<00:03:17.870> chapter<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.770> got<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.450> so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
I got a whole chapter on it I got it so

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.710 
I got a whole chapter on it I got it so
it<00:03:21.440> turns<00:03:21.680> out<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.890> will<00:03:22.280> survive<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.270> snap

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
it turns out you will survive that snap

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.060 
it turns out you will survive that snap
because<00:03:24.700> below<00:03:25.700> your<00:03:26.060> waist<00:03:26.210> while<00:03:26.510> there<00:03:26.720> are

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
because below your waist while there are

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.470 
because below your waist while there are
important<00:03:28.070> organs<00:03:28.520> there<00:03:28.880> are<00:03:28.970> no<00:03:29.090> vital

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
important organs there are no vital

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.850 
important organs there are no vital
organs<00:03:29.600> below<00:03:30.140> your<00:03:30.320> waist<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.640> torso

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
organs below your waist so your torso

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.160 
organs below your waist so your torso
will<00:03:33.860> stay<00:03:34.190> alive<00:03:34.580> for<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.210> little<00:03:35.690> while<00:03:35.840> okay

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
will stay alive for a little while okay

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.170 
will stay alive for a little while okay
until<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.160> bleed<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.460> death<00:03:37.580> but<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.030> all

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
until you bleed to death but this all

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.850 
until you bleed to death but this all
happens<00:03:38.510> much<00:03:38.720> faster<00:03:38.750> than<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.650> would<00:03:39.740> take

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
happens much faster than it would take

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.190 
happens much faster than it would take
to<00:03:39.920> bleed<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.310> death<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.940> these<00:03:41.570> two<00:03:41.990> pieces

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
to bleed to death so these two pieces

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.530 
to bleed to death so these two pieces
then<00:03:42.620> feel<00:03:42.920> tidal<00:03:43.310> forces<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.910> then<00:03:44.390> they

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
then feel tidal forces and then they

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.530 
then feel tidal forces and then they
snap<00:03:45.020> into<00:03:45.320> two<00:03:45.470> pieces<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.070> then<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:47.210> snap

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
snap into two pieces and then they snap

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.950 
snap into two pieces and then they snap
again<00:03:47.750> into<00:03:48.560> 8<00:03:48.710> and<00:03:48.980> then<00:03:49.850> 16<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.660> then<00:03:50.840> your

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
again into 8 and then 16 and then your

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.380 
again into 8 and then 16 and then your
bifurcating<00:03:51.890> your<00:03:52.100> way<00:03:52.250> down<00:03:52.490> and<00:03:52.790> so

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
bifurcating your way down and so

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.540 
bifurcating your way down and so
eventually<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:54.260> your<00:03:54.410> head<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.010> multiple

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
eventually it's your head and multiple

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.660 
eventually it's your head and multiple
other<00:03:55.700> parts<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.330> so<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:58.040> will<00:03:58.190> continue

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
other parts and so that will continue

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.390 
other parts and so that will continue
until<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.150> are<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.300> stream<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.960> atoms

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
until you are a stream of atoms

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.310 
until you are a stream of atoms
descending<00:04:01.400> toward<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> abyss<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:03.140> turns

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
descending toward the abyss and it turns

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.840 
descending toward the abyss and it turns
out<00:04:03.410> that's<00:04:03.590> not<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.940> worst<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:06.220> ok<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
out that's not the worst of it ok the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.290 
out that's not the worst of it ok the
work<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.720> turns<00:04:08.990> out<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.830> fabric<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.820> space

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
work it turns out the fabric of space

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.350 
work it turns out the fabric of space
and<00:04:11.540> time<00:04:12.430> funnels<00:04:13.430> down<00:04:13.550> towards<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.240> black

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
and time funnels down towards a black

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.800 
and time funnels down towards a black
hole<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.800> space<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:16.940> occupy<00:04:17.299> up

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
hole so the space that you occupy up

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.370 
hole so the space that you occupy up
here<00:04:18.170> is<00:04:19.239> larger<00:04:20.239> than<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.600> space<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.080> occupy

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
here is larger than the space you occupy

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.790 
here is larger than the space you occupy
down<00:04:21.830> here<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:23.300> in<00:04:23.600> fact<00:04:23.990> you're<00:04:24.380> getting

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
down here so in fact you're getting

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.940 
down here so in fact you're getting
while<00:04:25.760> you're<00:04:25.970> getting<00:04:26.120> stretched<00:04:26.950> you're

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
while you're getting stretched you're

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.920 
while you're getting stretched you're
getting<00:04:28.480> squeezed<00:04:30.940> extruded<00:04:31.940> through<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
getting squeezed extruded through the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.980 
getting squeezed extruded through the
fabric<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.680> space<00:04:34.010> like<00:04:34.880> toothpaste<00:04:35.450> through

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
fabric of space like toothpaste through

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.580 
fabric of space like toothpaste through
a<00:04:36.050> tube<00:04:37.480> now<00:04:39.310> we<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:40.430> a<00:04:40.460> word<00:04:40.730> for<00:04:40.760> that
