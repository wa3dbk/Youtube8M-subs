00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
styles of foot pegs different distances

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
styles of foot pegs different distances
of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.289> displacement<00:00:52.829> arms<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> factory

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of the displacement arms but the factory

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
of the displacement arms but the factory
foot<00:00:54.930> peg<00:00:55.140> replacement<00:00:55.710> piece<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.219> specific

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
foot peg replacement piece is specific

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
foot peg replacement piece is specific
only<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.809> motorcycle

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
only to your motorcycle

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
only to your motorcycle
so<00:00:59.329> removal<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.510> factory<00:01:01.050> foot<00:01:01.260> peg<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.649> very

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so removal your factory foot peg is very

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.570 
so removal your factory foot peg is very
simple<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.940> often<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> pin

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
simple most often is just to that pin

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
simple most often is just to that pin
I'm<00:01:05.580> replacing<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.689> peg<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.710> Reed

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I'm replacing the peg here Reed

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
I'm replacing the peg here Reed
replacing<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> pin<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.320> off<00:01:10.470> hook

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
replacing the pin and I'm just off hook

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
replacing the pin and I'm just off hook
on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> clip<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.280> there's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> clip<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> goes

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
on the clip but there's a clip that goes

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
on the clip but there's a clip that goes
in<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:14.159> main<00:01:14.400> foot<00:01:14.700> peg

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
in on the back so your main foot peg

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
in on the back so your main foot peg
here<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.659> able<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.560> many

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
here is then able to go in many

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
here is then able to go in many
positions<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.390> depending

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
positions all the way around depending

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
positions all the way around depending
on<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.740> displacement<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> arm<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
on this the displacement of the arm that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
on this the displacement of the arm that
you're<00:01:21.479> using<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you're using so that way you can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're using so that way you can
increase<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.970> distance<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.630> waist<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
increase the distance from your waist to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.530 
increase the distance from your waist to
your<00:01:25.170> foot<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.100> farther<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
your foot you can go farther back to the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
your foot you can go farther back to the
rear<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> bike<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.710> farther<00:01:28.950> down

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rear of the bike if you go farther down

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.399 
rear of the bike if you go farther down
you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.729> forward<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you can go forward a little up and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
you can go forward a little up and
forward<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.640> many<00:01:32.939> different

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
forward you can put it in many different

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.399 
forward you can put it in many different
positions<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.930> actually<00:01:34.200> eight

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
positions there's actually eight

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
positions there's actually eight
different<00:01:34.799> positions<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.850> around

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
different positions all the way around

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
different positions all the way around
on<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> spline<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> attach<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
on this spline where you can attach the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.330 
on this spline where you can attach the
displacement<00:01:39.329> arm

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.149 

simply<00:01:44.340> unscrewing<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:46.469> go<00:01:46.590> an<00:01:46.770> almost

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
simply unscrewing it I can go an almost

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.749 
simply unscrewing it I can go an almost
straight<00:01:47.310> forward<00:01:49.070> tighten<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.189> just

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
straight forward tighten it down just

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
straight forward tighten it down just
have<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> readjust<00:01:51.329> them<00:01:51.719> tighten<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.200> foot

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
have to readjust them tighten my foot

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
have to readjust them tighten my foot
peg<00:01:54.140> now<00:01:55.140> I'm<00:01:55.409> essentially<00:01:55.799> 30<00:01:56.280> millimeters

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
peg now I'm essentially 30 millimeters

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.690 
peg now I'm essentially 30 millimeters
almost<00:01:57.570> straight<00:01:57.810> forward<00:01:58.289> maybe<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
almost straight forward maybe down just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
almost straight forward maybe down just
ever<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.179> slightly<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.740> you
