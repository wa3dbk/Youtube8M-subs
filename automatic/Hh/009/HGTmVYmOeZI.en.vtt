00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 hello movie fans and welcome 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.850
 to a new video and we'll take a look 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.500
 today the 3d godzilla steelbook 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.110
 Exclusively available from Amazon 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.960
 we were asked by blu-ray 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.610
 I can not do it often enough 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 say an absolutely cool site so if 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.830
 which has not tended on facebook 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 own fault for the cancel I say 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.700
 I almost in the hour mode 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040
 Great deals on facebook at 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.760
 and so you miss absolutely nothing 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.630
 once among others dinslaken 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.420
 you are on the safe side 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.700
 and definitely does not miss any deals 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.770
 Now we start with the shortcut 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:09.360
 a 3d steelbook yes i have more as well 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.399
 had presented the big collector's 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.979
 edition with the statue also eyes 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.830
 with that greeting lastrup in it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.810
 but not arrived yet 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.289
 that i believe the same steelbook me 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.440
 knows exactly are only 1500 pieces 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.000
 and since you have to see times but we 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.220
 look now only first time that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.709
 the booker and short info also results 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 a media mark to these as 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.350
 alternatively variants are priced 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.100
 but he's the same with me on the 30th 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.190
 euro and I have to say short has none 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.380
 3d and moves much more modest 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.240
 as that comes the better we 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.720
 therefore with this red and black and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 silver we see from the back very much 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.050
 very cool artwork thumbs up yes 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 take a closer look at the thing 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.050
 So it looks like it shines like that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.490
 I have another camera 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 that's why this is all here today 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.090
 a bit different and full of quality 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.150
 I hope there are other cameras in the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.329
 repair so math so steelbook 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.390
 train is glossy I hope you can 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.280
 see well enough 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.610
 otherwise I would just have my words 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 so trust the whole looks from behind 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.230
 I think there was something better 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.659
 maybe you can still do it 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.079
 another motive of mozilla or or 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.709
 or 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:49.060
 I think a bit sad inside 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:50.890
 once in there the two nothing 3d and 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.510
 normal blu ray 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.139
 I can take it out for a moment 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.930
 get up to the motive of your dance style 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:04.840
 you can see that looks like that and that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:14.859
 it was actually already now 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:16.269
 short the bag paper and I get that 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.519
 still a bit so that then 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.290
 with Rheinberg that's once on top 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.870
 no fsk bottles like that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.629
 knows usual thing and she herself 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.410
 whole from behind and are also one 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.989
 few extras on it here you have to 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.840
 just read what's up with it 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.609
 what I wanted to watch now was just 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.760
 I mona the file moto car and engine 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.639
 Act sounds quite interesting otherwise 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.400
 I can only say whopping 123 minutes 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:52.629
 godzilla looks at the movie because 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.079
 who has not seen what 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.849
 lost 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.900
 but I have to say something 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.190
 we were like that you can do it completely 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.889
 just look at the open tv 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.269
 nice and good 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:08.190
 I think I have it here 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.109
 a 7.1 hd master dts on tour stops 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.250
 just a fat sound, it goes 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:18.820
 let's see what was on it 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:23.260
 it is clear that here blablabla dts hd 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.699
 master audio german 7.1 yes you have 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.070
 a 5.1 sound system 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.279
 do not worry the whole thing is super over 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.110
 definitely i have a 7.1 system that 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:35.680
 was gigantic it was gigantic me 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.419
 I think I have never had my home cinema 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.990
 So loud both had about this movie 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.080
 I think 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.680
 and it is because she was not absolute 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.969
 kinofeeling yes absolutely thumb up 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.620
 great release and me 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.110
 I think that too 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.729
 film does not come across so well without 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.349
 a home theater so if you live over 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.990
 tv speaker yes nice and good 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.370
 a great movie but that that works 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.400
 becomes in this film just like that 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.990
 gigantic so no cinema for me 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.029
 I really would like this film 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.870
 Others really did too too 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:15.120
 turn so yes I hope you have that 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.120
 it's all fallen from the side 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.320
 little de buck looks so easy 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.490
 it makes beautiful what a collection 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.630
 and otherwise I thank you for that 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.760
 I'll pack a few more 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.539
 Picture in and see you at 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.250
