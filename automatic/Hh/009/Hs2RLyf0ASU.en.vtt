hey guys what's up shadow n its back for
another<00:00:13.269> review<00:00:13.690> I<00:00:13.719> had<00:00:14.019> not<00:00:14.320> done<00:00:14.589> a<00:00:14.619> review

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
another review I had not done a review

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.370 
another review I had not done a review
in<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.250> super<00:00:15.759> long<00:00:16.000> time<00:00:16.449> and<00:00:16.779> I<00:00:16.840> realized<00:00:17.259> that

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
in a super long time and I realized that

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.080 
in a super long time and I realized that
I<00:00:17.470> actually<00:00:17.710> still<00:00:18.099> had<00:00:18.130> gameplay<00:00:18.849> that<00:00:19.000> I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
I actually still had gameplay that I

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.490 
I actually still had gameplay that I
never<00:00:19.300> used<00:00:19.630> from<00:00:19.840> before<00:00:20.169> when<00:00:20.349> I<00:00:20.410> was

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
never used from before when I was

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.740 
never used from before when I was
recording<00:00:20.949> the<00:00:21.160> Black<00:00:21.400> Dragon<00:00:21.610> TRG<00:00:22.329> review<00:00:22.720> I

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
recording the Black Dragon TRG review I

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.120 
recording the Black Dragon TRG review I
had<00:00:22.960> never<00:00:23.050> actually<00:00:23.289> got<00:00:23.500> around<00:00:23.529> of<00:00:23.739> making

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
had never actually got around of making

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.679 
had never actually got around of making
because<00:00:24.279> i<00:00:24.369> had<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.550> billion<00:00:25.060> other<00:00:25.119> videos<00:00:25.509> i

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
because i had a billion other videos i

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.210 
because i had a billion other videos i
wanted<00:00:25.929> to<00:00:25.990> make<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.710> just<00:00:26.890> completely

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
wanted to make and I just completely

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.410 
wanted to make and I just completely
forgot<00:00:27.310> around<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.759> get<00:00:27.880> around<00:00:28.000> of<00:00:28.119> this<00:00:28.210> one

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
forgot around to get around of this one

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.570 
forgot around to get around of this one
so<00:00:28.660> this<00:00:28.869> game<00:00:29.109> plays<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.410> bit<00:00:29.650> old<00:00:29.859> but<00:00:30.099> it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
so this game plays a bit old but it's

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.800 
so this game plays a bit old but it's
not<00:00:30.699> old<00:00:30.880> enough<00:00:31.089> that<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.359> doesn't<00:00:31.390> show<00:00:31.779> the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
not old enough that it doesn't show the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.420 
not old enough that it doesn't show the
gun<00:00:32.080> accurately<00:00:32.619> so<00:00:33.010> without<00:00:33.220> any<00:00:33.280> further

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
gun accurately so without any further

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.250 
gun accurately so without any further
ado<00:00:33.699> we<00:00:34.000> can<00:00:34.150> dive<00:00:34.300> right<00:00:34.570> into<00:00:34.690> this<00:00:34.839> review

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
ado we can dive right into this review

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740 
ado we can dive right into this review
this<00:00:35.739> is<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.070> black<00:00:36.280> dragon<00:00:36.670> TRG<00:00:37.000> 21<00:00:37.420> one<00:00:37.660> of

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
this is the black dragon TRG 21 one of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.329 
this is the black dragon TRG 21 one of
my<00:00:37.870> favorite<00:00:38.320> snipers<00:00:38.650> in<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.829> entire<00:00:39.040> game

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
my favorite snipers in the entire game

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.130 
my favorite snipers in the entire game
partially<00:00:40.089> because<00:00:40.180> it<00:00:40.390> looks<00:00:40.540> badass<00:00:40.750> and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
partially because it looks badass and

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.479 
partially because it looks badass and
partially<00:00:41.559> because<00:00:41.680> it's<00:00:41.890> actually<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> really

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
partially because it's actually a really

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.790 
partially because it's actually a really
great<00:00:42.820> sniper<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.750> only<00:00:43.989> real<00:00:44.170> downside<00:00:44.350> is

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
great sniper the only real downside is

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.139 
great sniper the only real downside is
it<00:00:44.920> doesn't<00:00:45.219> have<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.370> ton<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.579> ammo<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
it doesn't have a ton of ammo it's the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.290 
it doesn't have a ton of ammo it's the
same<00:00:46.360> as<00:00:46.510> an<00:00:46.600> l<00:00:46.750> 95<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.829> 15<00:00:48.190> shots<00:00:48.489> not<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:49.000> ton<00:00:49.210> of

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
same as an l 95 of 15 shots not a ton of

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.660 
same as an l 95 of 15 shots not a ton of
amelie<00:00:49.570> only<00:00:49.750> get<00:00:49.840> 20<00:00:49.989> total<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.670> sometimes

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
amelie only get 20 total and sometimes

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.400 
amelie only get 20 total and sometimes
the<00:00:51.850> shots<00:00:52.090> tank<00:00:52.420> but<00:00:52.660> they're<00:00:52.780> not<00:00:52.899> that<00:00:52.960> bad

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
the shots tank but they're not that bad

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.290 
the shots tank but they're not that bad
and<00:00:53.770> they're<00:00:54.160> not<00:00:54.250> going<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.519> tank<00:00:54.699> every<00:00:55.059> time

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
and they're not going to tank every time

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.689 
and they're not going to tank every time
like<00:00:55.539> some<00:00:55.840> other<00:00:55.960> weapons<00:00:56.379> but<00:00:56.980> here<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.579> go

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
like some other weapons but here we go

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.580 
like some other weapons but here we go
with<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.940> stats<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.449> by<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.600> way<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:59.289> stats

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
with the stats and by the way the stats

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.500 
with the stats and by the way the stats
are<00:00:59.739> going<00:00:59.859> to<00:00:59.920> be<00:01:00.010> from<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.280> old<00:01:00.489> system<00:01:00.879> not

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
are going to be from the old system not

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.000 
are going to be from the old system not
the<00:01:01.539> new<00:01:01.899> system<00:01:02.170> because<00:01:02.710> more<00:01:02.980> people

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
the new system because more people

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.070 
the new system because more people
understand<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.969> old<00:01:04.119> system<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.600> stats<00:01:04.839> than

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
understand the old system of stats than

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.560 
understand the old system of stats than
the<00:01:05.199> new<00:01:05.350> system<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.009> here<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.670> go<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.210> damage

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
the new system so here we go the damage

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.690 
the new system so here we go the damage
is<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.720> 100<00:01:08.350> but<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.860> performs<00:01:09.280> much<00:01:09.460> higher

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
is a 100 but it performs much higher

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.400 
is a 100 but it performs much higher
than<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.090> especially<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.539> closer<00:01:10.750> ranges<00:01:11.259> if

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
than that especially in closer ranges if

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.590 
than that especially in closer ranges if
you<00:01:11.860> are<00:01:12.009> at<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> medium<00:01:12.700> range<00:01:12.880> or<00:01:13.030> closer<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
you are at a medium range or closer it

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.680 
you are at a medium range or closer it
will<00:01:13.780> always<00:01:14.319> be<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.500> one-shot<00:01:14.770> kill<00:01:15.310> it's<00:01:15.940> my

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
will always be a one-shot kill it's my

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.359 
will always be a one-shot kill it's my
tank<00:01:16.959> at<00:01:17.170> longer<00:01:17.500> ranges<00:01:17.860> but<00:01:18.039> it's<00:01:18.190> pretty

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
tank at longer ranges but it's pretty

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.919 
tank at longer ranges but it's pretty
unlikely<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.209> even<00:01:19.330> going<00:01:19.599> to<00:01:19.630> do<00:01:19.780> that

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
unlikely that it's even going to do that

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.350 
unlikely that it's even going to do that
it's<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.679> pretty<00:01:20.979> solid<00:01:21.340> one<00:01:21.700> shot<00:01:21.970> kill<00:01:22.209> at

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
it's a pretty solid one shot kill at

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.120 
it's a pretty solid one shot kill at
most<00:01:22.569> ranges<00:01:23.050> so<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.319> shouldn't<00:01:23.709> be<00:01:23.860> worrying

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
most ranges so you shouldn't be worrying

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.309 
most ranges so you shouldn't be worrying
about<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.429> too<00:01:24.580> much<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.940> besides<00:01:25.330> past<00:01:25.989> kill

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
about it too much and besides past kill

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.199 
about it too much and besides past kill
creek<00:01:26.590> range<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.310> might<00:01:27.489> not<00:01:27.640> want<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.000> start

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
creek range you might not want to start

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:29.760 
creek range you might not want to start
a<00:01:28.300> gunfight<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.959> that<00:01:29.050> range<00:01:29.289> anyway<00:01:29.619> it's

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
a gunfight of that range anyway it's

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.169 
a gunfight of that range anyway it's
probably<00:01:29.979> better<00:01:30.099> to<00:01:30.160> get<00:01:30.340> closer<00:01:30.610> if<00:01:30.849> you<00:01:30.880> can

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
probably better to get closer if you can

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.359 
probably better to get closer if you can
anyway<00:01:31.509> so<00:01:32.229> statistically<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:33.009> portability

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
anyway so statistically the portability

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.249 
anyway so statistically the portability
is<00:01:33.550> 40<00:01:34.000> which<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.270> fine<00:01:34.539> it's<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.899> much<00:01:35.110> more

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
is 40 which is fine it's a much more

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.260 
is 40 which is fine it's a much more
portable<00:01:35.530> than<00:01:35.770> average<00:01:36.160> sniper<00:01:36.459> although

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
portable than average sniper although

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.389 
portable than average sniper although
it's<00:01:37.539> not<00:01:37.780> exactly<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.319> most<00:01:38.649> portable<00:01:39.099> there

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
it's not exactly the most portable there

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's not exactly the most portable there
are<00:01:39.580> more<00:01:39.849> portable<00:01:40.209> snipers<00:01:40.660> than<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.020> for

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
are more portable snipers than this for

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.400 
are more portable snipers than this for
example<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.069> hemos<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.880> m107<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.899> Old<00:01:44.080> Glory

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
example the hemos the m107 the Old Glory

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.219 
example the hemos the m107 the Old Glory
is<00:01:44.709> a<00:01:44.739> 47<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.420> original<00:01:46.899> one<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.110> only

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
is a 47 and the original one is only

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.109 
is a 47 and the original one is only
like<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.470> 32<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:48.099> something<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.880> kind

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
like a 32 or something so this is kind

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.669 
like a 32 or something so this is kind
of<00:01:49.209> in<00:01:49.390> between<00:01:49.539> those<00:01:50.020> two<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
of in between those two so the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.680 
of in between those two so the
portability<00:01:51.069> is<00:01:51.280> definitely<00:01:51.640> not<00:01:51.729> bad<00:01:51.970> but<00:01:52.599> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
portability is definitely not bad but it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.449 
portability is definitely not bad but it
could<00:01:52.720> be<00:01:52.959> better<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.649> rate<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.860> fire<00:01:54.160> however

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
could be better the rate of fire however

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.070 
could be better the rate of fire however
is<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.819> 16<00:01:55.300> that's<00:01:55.420> right<00:01:55.629> up<00:01:55.750> there<00:01:55.929> with<00:01:55.989> the

you<00:02:06.459> don't<00:02:06.729> even<00:02:06.879> need<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.119> quick<00:02:07.330> switch<00:02:07.599> if

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
you don't even need a quick switch if

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.270 
you don't even need a quick switch if

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
a 16 rate of fire so that's totally fine

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the accuracies of 98 which means it's so

especially<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.310> you're<00:02:27.400> camping<00:02:27.760> with<00:02:27.910> this

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
especially if you're camping with this

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.790 
especially if you're camping with this
rifle<00:02:28.240> do<00:02:28.840> i<00:02:28.930> recommend<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.380> quick<00:02:29.560> switch

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
rifle do i recommend you quick switch

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.710 
rifle do i recommend you quick switch
with<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.610> probably<00:02:30.850> don't<00:02:31.000> need<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
with it you probably don't need to I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.660 
with it you probably don't need to I
don't<00:02:32.260> usually<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.860> most<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.280> time<00:02:33.460> but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
don't usually do most of the time but

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.850 
don't usually do most of the time but
you<00:02:33.820> totally<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.320> not<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.770> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
you totally can and it's not going to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.080 
you totally can and it's not going to
hurt<00:02:35.980> your<00:02:36.160> performance<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.700> any<00:02:36.850> way

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
hurt your performance in any way

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.360 
hurt your performance in any way
although<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.840> may<00:02:38.110> slow<00:02:38.350> down<00:02:38.710> your<00:02:38.920> fire<00:02:39.130> rate

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
although it may slow down your fire rate

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.830 
although it may slow down your fire rate
a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:39.820> although<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.420> might<00:02:40.540> be<00:02:40.690> good

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
a little bit although that might be good

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.390 
a little bit although that might be good
because<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.200> need<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.380> give<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> spread<00:02:42.220> time

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
because you need to give the spread time

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
because you need to give the spread time
to<00:02:42.520> recover<00:02:42.700> anyway<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.570> recoil<00:02:43.960> is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
to recover anyway the recoil is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.050 
to recover anyway the recoil is
technically<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.560> 65<00:02:45.160> which<00:02:45.670> doesn't<00:02:45.940> really

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
technically a 65 which doesn't really

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.480 
technically a 65 which doesn't really

matter it's a bolt-action rifle you fire

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.920 
matter it's a bolt-action rifle you fire
slow<00:02:48.880> enough<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.390> recoil<00:02:49.720> doesn't

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
really have time to hurt you that much

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.710 
really have time to hurt you that much
anyway<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.150> bolt-action<00:02:52.420> sniper

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.080

absolutely what do I give it about an
8.5<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.850> 10<00:03:25.060> there<00:03:25.240> are<00:03:25.300> a<00:03:25.360> couple<00:03:25.510> of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
maximum ranges then I would probably

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.180 
maximum ranges then I would probably
like<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.900> bit<00:03:55.959> more<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.230> think<00:03:56.410> since<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:56.950> so

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
like it a bit more I think since it's so

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.310 
like it a bit more I think since it's so

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.470

just something that you get out of a

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
be considered an ex rare in my opinion

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.259 
be considered an ex rare in my opinion
and<00:04:05.860> then<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.310> should<00:04:06.459> perform<00:04:06.580> like<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.120> it

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
and then it should perform like that it

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.670 
and then it should perform like that it
should<00:04:07.420> be<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.810> consistent<00:04:08.110> one<00:04:08.410> shot

should be a more consistent one shot

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.229 
should be a more consistent one shot
kill<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:09.430> would<00:04:09.550> definitely<00:04:09.700> bring<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.090> lot

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
kill that would definitely bring a lot
