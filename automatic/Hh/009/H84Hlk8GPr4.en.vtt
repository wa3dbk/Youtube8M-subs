there when you're wearing the sneaker
will<00:05:37.650> happen<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.190> sneakers<00:05:38.550> right<00:05:38.580> here

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
will happen is the sneakers right here

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.550 
will happen is the sneakers right here
and<00:05:39.240> it<00:05:39.360> will<00:05:39.420> just<00:05:39.600> come<00:05:39.750> up<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.020> ankle<00:05:40.350> but

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
and it will just come up the ankle but

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.930 
and it will just come up the ankle but
if<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.740> was<00:05:40.830> pains<00:05:41.070> it<00:05:41.220> would<00:05:41.310> just<00:05:41.460> fall<00:05:41.640> over
