00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
just recently and I had to buy it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
just recently and I had to buy it
because<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.580> can't<00:01:09.759> find<00:01:09.940> out<00:01:10.119> no<00:01:10.240> more<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
this one it actually came with this it's

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.060 
this one it actually came with this it's
the<00:01:18.880> cube<00:01:19.240> brand<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.440> course<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.890> to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
the cube brand and of course that to

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.580 
the cube brand and of course that to
stick<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.850> can<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.290> on<00:01:23.380> there

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.770 
I can get 100 of them for 20 to 25 bucks
and<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:52.090> minis<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.690> can<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:53.129> 60<00:02:54.129> of<00:02:54.250> them<00:02:54.780> for

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and the minis I can get 60 of them for

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.110 
and the minis I can get 60 of them for
about<00:02:56.370> $30<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.610> it's<00:02:57.760> not<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.269> big<00:02:59.140> price<00:02:59.409> drop

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
about $30 so it's not a big price drop

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.479 
about $30 so it's not a big price drop
but<00:03:01.120> they're<00:03:01.450> hard<00:03:01.689> to<00:03:01.719> find<00:03:02.159> add<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.219> little

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
but they're hard to find add a little

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.250 
but they're hard to find add a little
value<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.909> your<00:03:04.180> game<00:03:04.420> view

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
value to your game view

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:15.559 
value to your game view
so

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:33.150 

you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.370 

I'm<00:03:34.160> out
