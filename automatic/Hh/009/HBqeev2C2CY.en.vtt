00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.960
 today we will cut the white to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.639
 it takes a size and his son 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 to tell you the truth it is not quite his 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.410
 son there is a son inside 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.289
 of the box as well as a charger because it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.730
 need from time to time recharge our 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 cut 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.090
 the first thing to do is to insert 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.720
 the blade in the device 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.760
 for this it must open is inserted the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 blade until one hears a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.680
 snap shut and remove the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 sheath to start there is a security 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.960
 you have to use the thumb and the index in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.140
 same time as demonstrated laugh and lo and behold 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.510
 we can begin to carve the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 yes it can be done so 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.770
 relaxed do not cut too much 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.489
 deeply 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 but at each size the noise will reinforce 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.000
 its structure with time that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 will become easier we use the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.400
 thumb and forefinger with one hand the other hand 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.729
 is held at a respectable distance for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.729
 your security 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460
 m 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.630
 the little people on the right can 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.350
 to use a son recourse of the strained by 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.020
 but if you take the trouble 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 watch and from time to time take a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.940
 little distance we can see that a 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.940
 elegant little hen occurs 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.580
 if the size runs in spring the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 young twig color indicates 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.490
 which have just pushed the most 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 much of his eyes a twig 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.060
 will be removed 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.010
 there is yet another benefit to cutting 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.290
 a ball of noise very often one can 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.980
 notice that the upper leaves 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.200
 are a little folded on it even a little 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.739
 like a cabbage it's an insect that in 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 is the cause 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:31.379
 by cutting you also remove these 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.379
 insects and a digg and the scourge 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 if we do this about twice 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.319
 year you get a nice ball well 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.480
 close once will suffice but two 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.930
 time is ideal size is practiced 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.020
 still hanging them -100 their so from 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 May to end of August 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.840
 but we can still do it at the beginning of 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.840
 September if we want
