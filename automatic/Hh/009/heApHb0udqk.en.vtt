00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.290
 good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.100
 we are in plants see solutions for 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.050
 what are uruguay? 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 well we are here on the screen 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260
 start because I'm teaching what 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.470
 is what you see above that is the range 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 maximum that your avatar the color that is a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.590
 sapphire blue and white maximum 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.129
 of 233 there you can not happen to not be 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.350
 make another update here and now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.020
 you can not pass rank from the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 maximum and good range gives you to have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 all the achievement because it has reached the rank 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.240
 maximum more than anything this video for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.580
 report that either maximum range 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.690
 As you can see all the characters have 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.380
 reached its level 30 until peas 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.380
 carnivorous plant 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.140
 sunflower cactus 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.260
 hi is this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.479
 scientific engineer and soldier level 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.790
 30 and apart from having all the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.130
 characters at the maximum level you know that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.970
 I have all the stickers 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.330
 then if you think 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.290
 or someone doubts my professionalism 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.300
 As a player 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.200
 at the time of going to play I have all 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.200
 the accessory stickers 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.290
 spend a little bit is going to be long 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.800
 the ways all these stickers the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.410
 You can see in the video 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.030
 customizations and gestures because that's it 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.250
 represent all these stickers 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.250
 they are gestures there you see the gestures 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.860
 too much to that you 're also down 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.480
 they all go to a game that I 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.480
 I like to keep playing logically 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.800
 soon mario lime will come out with 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.170
 which will be more inactive in this game 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.870
 but good 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.280
 I loved it and of course I will continue 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.380
 playing and from time to time 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.600
 videos 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.540
 always some and even I still have 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.500
 videos in the manga that I still do not know no 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.500
 time to prepare it 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.790
 but we will see videos of this game 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 Mario Kart and other games other titles 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.620
 acquired so you can enjoy them 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.750
 in the channel 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.360
 I do not tell you because, well, if I say them 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.730
 many would not even see what 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.849
 come and see it for yourselves and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.620
 what do you think and comment what you think 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.620
 each game they exhibit 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.549
 what you like is what we like 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.920
 as you can see all the good stickers this 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.160
 before level 230 I had all the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.080
 stickers before level 233 that decides 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 the last rank already had all the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.440
 stickers I think at 180 or 160 out there 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.410
 between 60 and 180 I already had all the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.090
 stickers of this game 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 weapons weapons 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.800
 the two that have there are many 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.750
 weapon stickers other than those of 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.750
 helmets and facial hair 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.330
 sixth 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.099
 we give this quickly to layers 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.480
 I already tell you that if I pass quickly because 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.579
 I have uploaded the video of the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.079
 customizations if all the 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.909
 weapons because I would have to look take it for 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.909
 zombie and pass all your weapons 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.310
 that many of them the only thing that changes 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.840
 it is the color of series but good you have 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.730
 there two videos of personalization of 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.230
 each character in this game of each 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.230
 character class of this game 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.620
 and nothing I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.080
 I have enjoyed it if I still enjoy it 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.130
 just like I do with monster hunter that 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.350
 from time to time I stay with the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.780
 companions to do hunts too 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.020
 I'm logically at 999 maximum 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.020
 of that game and good in the games that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.870
 I catch if I like game that I blow 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.170
 I assure because of the urban xv that I have 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.720
 to the maximum would be the east 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.160
 zombie of 3 and 3 that also what 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.640
 you can see my playlist is 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.770
 the guide of secondary missions of the 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.840
 game that the rest comes on screen to 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.640
 the objects where they are all the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.070
 map marked with which I have not done in 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.740
 the guide of that because it already leaves mark 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.240
 ong on the map but the missions 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.070
 secondary many do not know where 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.050
 go when they put a mission 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.720
 secondary or what survivors are there for 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.020
 save 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.620
 and in the channel you can find why 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.930
 I was dedicated to completing the game one hundred 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.180
 for one hundrerd 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.460
 there are people to others youtube is me 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.440
 complete things one hundred percent and they 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.250
 I usually devote many hours when I take 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.250
 a game that I like 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.639
 and here we come to the last album that is 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.699
 the zombies 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.460
 with their weapons here each one these are the 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.990
 aspect that you give rules all change 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.860
 well they have a chrome one of 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.330
 future and one of gold and then and that of 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.490
 special from the zombie fool is also me 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.999
 forgot and then good other kind of 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.659
 customizations with other colors or 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.659
 more curious 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.129
 and finally I need to teach the achievements 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.439
 of this game 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.839
 that the achievements of this game as we go 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.119
 to go see them also complete when 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.769
 came out the update I had to go back to 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:24.499
 make new achievements because they took out 

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:27.649
 new achievements the game had 100% and 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:29.769

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.769

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.240
 the partial 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:40.060
 we give it and we get the 55 drinks 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.280
 points that we can achieve with this 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.260

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.430
 challenges with all the challenges achieved the 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.580
 game that they give us in the form of a sticker 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.849
 as well 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.650
 of images you already know are not glasses 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:03.229
 they are images and apart they give us 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.229
 money depending on the type of challenge 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.330
 there are challenges easier and also difficult 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:17.080
 here 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.080
 the last challenge of block 27 of 2014 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:30.290
 the last challenge 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:33.510
 and one as this would be 21/04/2011 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.730

 sandby with the other the memory in the 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.080
