00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
recommend turning that on because if you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
recommend turning that on because if you
leave<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.150> you'll<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> there's<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this and the other thing you can do here

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.260 
this and the other thing you can do here
is<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> auto<00:01:14.460> save<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:14.970> photo

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
is you can auto save to your photo

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
is you can auto save to your photo
library<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.080> default<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.280> done

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
library so by default when you're done

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
library so by default when you're done
you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.820> save<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.330> images<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> photo

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
you can save your images to a photo

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.859 
you can save your images to a photo
gallery<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.369> photo<00:01:20.610> library

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
gallery but it's not your photo library

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
gallery but it's not your photo library
so<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> automatically<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> need<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so to automatically do that you need to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
so to automatically do that you need to
turn<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.119> I'm<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> leave<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> off

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
turn that on I'm going to leave it off

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
turn that on I'm going to leave it off
for<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.180> easy

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
for now now to do this it's really easy

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
for now now to do this it's really easy
first<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> either<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> take<00:01:28.979> a
