absolutely brilliant for menu I think

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.280 
absolutely brilliant for menu I think
it's<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> second<00:00:36.480> season<00:00:36.630> factor

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's actually a second season factor

like<00:01:19.380> 12<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> honest<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.750> there's<00:01:21.770> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
like 12 to be honest but there's it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.030 
like 12 to be honest but there's it
looks<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.280> made<00:01:23.610> known<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
looks like he made known in the in the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
looks like he made known in the in the
prone<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.310> obviously<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.420> fake

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
prone so obviously that's got to be fake

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
prone so obviously that's got to be fake
because<00:01:28.020> he<00:01:28.560> would<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.799> made<00:01:28.920> tears<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
because he would have made tears but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.789 
because he would have made tears but
yeah<00:01:29.520> anyway<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.360> think<00:01:30.750> dahej<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
yeah anyway I think dahej was going to

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
yeah anyway I think dahej was going to
go<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> 83<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.119> honest<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.079> maybe

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
go to 83 to be honest I can see maybe

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890 
go to 83 to be honest I can see maybe
minimum<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> 82<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.329> he's<00:01:36.420> got<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.780> up

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
minimum is 82 I think he's got to go up

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.289 
minimum is 82 I think he's got to go up
a<00:01:36.990> couple<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> levels<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.770> least<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.299> he

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a couple of levels at least because he

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
a couple of levels at least because he
is<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.840> ears<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.680> keeper<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
is a good ears of really good keeper a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
is a good ears of really good keeper a
lot<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> people<00:01:41.430> slates<00:01:41.909> him<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.270> he<00:01:43.079> lets<00:01:43.259> in

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lot of people slates him as he lets in

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
like the next van der sar van der sar

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.270 
like the next van der sar van der sar
owned<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.969> box<00:02:03.299> when<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.990> menu<00:02:04.290> he<00:02:04.829> he

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
owned that box when he was at menu he he

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
owned that box when he was at menu he he
dominated<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.090> he<00:02:06.149> knew<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
dominated and he knew what to do and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.760 
dominated and he knew what to do and
what<00:02:07.140> how<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.320> won

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
what how we won

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
what how we won
done<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.580> hopefully<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.149> hair<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.509> become

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
done so hopefully the hair will become

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.380 
done so hopefully the hair will become
that<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.289> rate<00:02:10.500> player<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.970> ratings

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that kind of rate player as for ratings

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.509 
that kind of rate player as for ratings
83<00:02:13.019> i<00:02:13.050> think<00:02:13.349> is<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> good<00:02:13.739> rate<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.160> i'll<00:02:14.280> know

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
83 i think is a good rate and i'll know

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.330 
83 i think is a good rate and i'll know
a<00:02:14.550> lot<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> keepers<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> BPO<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.950> get

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
a lot of keepers in the BPO don't get

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.430 
a lot of keepers in the BPO don't get
high<00:02:17.489> ratings<00:02:17.910> apart<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.360> loris<00:02:19.019> who<00:02:19.140> came

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
high ratings apart from loris who came

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.670 
high ratings apart from loris who came
in<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.800> smashed<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.940> 87<00:02:21.720> Weaver<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
in and smashed is 87 Weaver that's a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.100 
in and smashed is 87 Weaver that's a
pretty<00:02:22.860> decent<00:02:23.310> rain<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.000> think<00:02:24.209> check<00:02:24.480> got<00:02:24.629> 85

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
pretty decent rain I think check got 85

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.289 
pretty decent rain I think check got 85
/<00:02:25.260> 84<00:02:25.709> was<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.879> forward<00:02:27.180> to

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
/ 84 was it I think it was a forward to

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.309 
/ 84 was it I think it was a forward to
be<00:02:27.390> honest<00:02:27.629> ha<00:02:28.470> good<00:02:28.680> 84<00:02:29.099> Raina<00:02:29.430> got<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.730> free<00:02:30.319> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
be honest ha good 84 Raina got a free so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.110 
be honest ha good 84 Raina got a free so
you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.830> see<00:02:32.129> there<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:32.549> don't<00:02:32.879> really

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you can see there that they don't really

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.229 
you can see there that they don't really
get<00:02:33.330> high<00:02:33.569> ratings<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.910> keeping<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.120> mind

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
get high ratings so keeping that in mind

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.600 
get high ratings so keeping that in mind
if<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:36.870> don't<00:02:37.170> upgrade<00:02:37.440> check<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> heart

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
if they don't upgrade check and heart

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
if they don't upgrade check and heart
and<00:02:38.870> rank<00:02:39.870> well<00:02:40.049> rain<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.440> kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.769> going<00:02:40.890> on

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and rank well rain is kind of going on

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
and rank well rain is kind of going on
the<00:02:41.069> down<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:42.180> if<00:02:42.450> they<00:02:42.569> don't<00:02:42.750> change

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the down really but if they don't change

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.620 
the down really but if they don't change
like<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.860> keepers<00:02:44.220> hot<00:02:44.430> too<00:02:44.640> high<00:02:44.790> rated<00:02:45.269> then

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
like the keepers hot too high rated then

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.870 
like the keepers hot too high rated then
I<00:02:45.720> think<00:02:45.930> AC<00:02:46.140> free<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> perfect<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.790> of

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
I think AC free is the perfect kind of

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720 
I think AC free is the perfect kind of
rain<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.510> him<00:02:48.630> he<00:02:49.079> is<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.549> keepers

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
rain for him he is one of the keepers

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.460 
rain for him he is one of the keepers
it's<00:02:51.060> pretty<00:02:51.329> decent<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.810> hopefully<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's pretty decent and hopefully is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.319 
it's pretty decent and hopefully is
going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> next<00:02:53.940> stars<00:02:54.150> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
going to be one of the next stars of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.120 
going to be one of the next stars of
menu<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.140> move<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.349> over<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.799> status<00:02:56.099> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
menu so move it over to the status that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.699 
menu so move it over to the status that
we've<00:02:56.340> got<00:02:56.579> their<00:02:56.819> 85<00:02:57.720> Dave<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.319> think<00:02:58.560> his

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
we've got their 85 Dave and I think his

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.910 
we've got their 85 Dave and I think his
reflexes<00:02:59.400> diving<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.209> positioning<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.019> pretty

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
reflexes diving in positioning is pretty

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.220 
reflexes diving in positioning is pretty
decent<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.489> think<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.780> makes<00:03:04.019> up<00:03:04.200> for

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
decent I think that kind of makes up for

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.890 
decent I think that kind of makes up for
his<00:03:04.380> speed<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:05.040> real<00:03:05.640> life<00:03:05.910> because<00:03:06.690> obviously

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
his speed in real life because obviously

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.720 
his speed in real life because obviously
he's<00:03:07.230> not<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.440> fastest<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.040> keepers<00:03:08.430> he<00:03:08.549> does

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
he's not the fastest of keepers he does

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.970 
he's not the fastest of keepers he does
make<00:03:08.910> kind<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.510> bit<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.440> bit<00:03:10.680> slow

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
make kind of a bit like bit slow

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.410 
make kind of a bit like bit slow
movements<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.579> when<00:03:11.819> he's<00:03:11.940> read<00:03:12.180> when<00:03:12.329> he

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
movements but when he's read when he

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420 
movements but when he's read when he
gets<00:03:12.569> reflex<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.290> he's<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.310> at

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
gets reflex on it he's really good at

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.629 
gets reflex on it he's really good at
them<00:03:14.609> kind<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.970> last-minute<00:03:15.660> kind<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.639> put

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
them kind of last-minute kind of put

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.849 
them kind of last-minute kind of put
pushes<00:03:18.120> into<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.720> corner<00:03:19.200> or<00:03:19.380> pushing<00:03:19.769> it

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
pushes into like a corner or pushing it

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.129 
pushes into like a corner or pushing it
out<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.100> his<00:03:20.220> goal<00:03:20.450> he's<00:03:21.450> really<00:03:21.720> good<00:03:21.959> at<00:03:22.049> that

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
out of his goal he's really good at that

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.770 
out of his goal he's really good at that
so<00:03:22.680> 71<00:03:23.250> handle<00:03:23.519> nothing<00:03:23.850> that's<00:03:24.329> kind<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.600> for

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
so 71 handle nothing that's kind of for

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.059 
so 71 handle nothing that's kind of for
you<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.989> decide<00:03:25.230> what<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.650> reckon<00:03:25.950> that

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
you to decide what do you reckon that

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.259 
you to decide what do you reckon that
will<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.639> couldn't<00:03:26.910> see<00:03:27.060> what

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
will be because I couldn't see what

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.180 
will be because I couldn't see what
handling<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.900> because<00:03:28.590> he's<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
handling is because he's not the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
handling is because he's not the
greatest<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.850> captured<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.269> ball<00:03:30.510> he's

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
greatest that captured the ball he's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.509 
greatest that captured the ball he's
really<00:03:31.139> just<00:03:31.290> one<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.560> them<00:03:31.650> ones<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.310> likes

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
really just one of them ones that likes

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.910 
really just one of them ones that likes
to<00:03:32.730> parry<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.299> preferred<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.410> thought<00:03:34.620> I'd

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
to parry in a preferred so I thought I'd

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
to parry in a preferred so I thought I'd
leave<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.790> decide<00:03:36.109> 86<00:03:37.109> kicking

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
leave that to you to decide 86 kicking

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.839 
leave that to you to decide 86 kicking
just<00:03:37.620> one<00:03:37.769> more<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.130> balance<00:03:38.250> everything<00:03:38.549> out

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
just one more to balance everything out

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.930 
just one more to balance everything out
18<00:03:39.510> on<00:03:39.599> reflex<00:03:40.260> from<00:03:40.680> an<00:03:40.859> extra<00:03:41.220> two<00:03:41.519> there<00:03:41.760> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
18 on reflex from an extra two there I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
18 on reflex from an extra two there I
think<00:03:42.630> his<00:03:42.720> reflexes<00:03:43.019> are<00:03:43.230> absolutely

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think his reflexes are absolutely

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.800 
think his reflexes are absolutely
fantastic<00:03:44.250> I've<00:03:45.239> kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> gave<00:03:45.630> him<00:03:45.750> a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
fantastic I've kind of gave him a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
fantastic I've kind of gave him a
four-speed<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.530> even<00:03:46.829> things<00:03:47.069> out<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.400> he<00:03:47.519> goes

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
four-speed to even things out as he goes

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.970 
four-speed to even things out as he goes
20<00:03:48.030> free<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:48.959> his<00:03:49.049> speed<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.349> quite<00:03:49.709> low

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
20 free I think his speed is quite low

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.400 
20 free I think his speed is quite low
but<00:03:50.359> it's<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.690> it's<00:03:51.720> one<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.200> things<00:03:52.230> that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
but it's a it's one of the things that

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.870 
but it's a it's one of the things that
he'll<00:03:52.560> hopefully<00:03:52.739> work<00:03:53.130> on<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.489> maybe<00:03:53.639> get

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
he'll hopefully work on and maybe get

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.879 
he'll hopefully work on and maybe get
faster<00:03:54.329> or<00:03:54.389> whatever<00:03:55.139> he<00:03:55.260> can<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.739> improve

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
faster or whatever he can do to improve

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.490 
faster or whatever he can do to improve
and<00:03:56.549> then<00:03:56.970> finally<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.359> gave<00:03:57.480> him<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:57.840> extra<00:03:58.079> few

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and then finally I gave him an extra few

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.650 
and then finally I gave him an extra few
on<00:03:58.739> his<00:03:59.310> position<00:03:59.849> and<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.329> as<00:04:00.510> I

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
on his position and as you see as I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.809 
on his position and as you see as I
think<00:04:00.900> positioning<00:04:01.620> why's<00:04:01.769> he<00:04:02.400> needs<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.730> be

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
think positioning why's he needs to be

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.370 
think positioning why's he needs to be
in<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.000> position<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> reflex<00:04:04.079> saves

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
in the position to do the reflex saves

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.740 
in the position to do the reflex saves
and<00:04:04.590> get<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.459> good<00:04:05.639> dives<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.150> him<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.599> I<00:04:06.630> think

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and get the good dives on him so I think

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.690 
and get the good dives on him so I think
really<00:04:07.200> positioning<00:04:08.010> should<00:04:08.250> go<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.609> little

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
really positioning should go up a little

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.150 
really positioning should go up a little
bit<00:04:08.940> as<00:04:09.090> he<00:04:09.389> is<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.660> really<00:04:10.230> good<00:04:10.349> stops<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.980> shot

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
bit as he is a really good stops a shot

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.699 
bit as he is a really good stops a shot
stopper<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.690> there<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:12.989> hopefully<00:04:13.410> did

stopper so there you go hopefully did

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.129
