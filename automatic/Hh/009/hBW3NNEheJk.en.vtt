00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
it's very different for me I would say

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.780 
it's very different for me I would say
it's<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.470> challenge<00:03:11.860> because<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.400> very

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
it's a challenge because it's very

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.520 
it's a challenge because it's very
different<00:03:13.090> from<00:03:13.390> my<00:03:13.630> stallion<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.410> other

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
different from my stallion so the other

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.140 
different from my stallion so the other
horses<00:03:14.770> are<00:03:14.950> right<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.430> huge<00:03:15.670> different<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
writing and of course it's very it's

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.300 
writing and of course it's very it's
good<00:03:19.810> because<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.170> makes<00:03:20.350> me<00:03:20.530> even<00:03:20.590> more

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
good because it makes me even more

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.890 
good because it makes me even more
skilled<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.510> still<00:03:23.110> it's<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.770> air<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.870> we'll

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
skilled but still it's an air now we'll

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.500 
skilled but still it's an air now we'll
see<00:03:26.110> let's<00:03:26.560> see<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.830> manage<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.030> what<00:03:28.420> does
