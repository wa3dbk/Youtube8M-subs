 the fox was essentially American 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.110
 90% must say that the United States the Americans are recovering I think that 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.270
 300 million people they are very very melted reptiles are of 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.229
 people who are passionate about reptiles 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.180
 and there are a lot of deaths including jewelry for example who buy in 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.389
 mass in their windows to protect the ump against thieves know some 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.099
 buying spiders scorpions et cetera that are born in the showcase the 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.099
 evening 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.729
 Why 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.800
 moreover it is positive 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.780
 and that's a species since a person who is traveling but it's 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.099
 a species in e2 specific 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.639
 it's a very special species to invest among others in togo 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.969
 Benin a little bit of air france klm was very impressed by the 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.050
 to move from a very big world 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 anger of the inhabitants has dancers 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.599
 movable capital 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.189
 at a number of years the main problem was is very 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.889
 certainly the traffic but at the moment the trade has taken such a 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.889
 extent 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.330
 that but now it's the illegal trade supermarkets and big 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.840
 shops the hall species of popularization of these new animals 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.650
 company that we are seeing at the moment which represents a 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.139
 threat very very serious of course it's a social phenomenon that 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.169
 is linked to a 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.500
 to a malaise to an ill-being of our society people now prefer 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.999
 caring for their help who have the pride of their python or their 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.999
 exotic animal animals rather than chatting with neighbors 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.330
 on the internet he decides to sell millinois pushed like 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.460
 mushrooms some forums are real hubs 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.080
 for the sale of animals and costs 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 here we came across a page that is offered for sale 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.449
 so come to no control in mind for once if anyone is 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.510
 remember a blue card can command an animal like this as 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.869
 a mygale she has revenge him a few days after my heart 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:51.979
 by a carrier simply as resale actually 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.879
 here for example proposed 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.039
 denis dyack belongs to a kind as possible career 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.199
 the sound is available aggressively and especially that laurent bonnart is very 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.149
 toxic 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:04.469
 she already has trained organizations that are 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:06.689
 and reveal enough fatty liver that leads the calm 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.369
 the coma one day so how the animal has not put in all hands true 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:12.749
 that internet allows very easy contacts between 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.839
 between him and between the passionate and therefore inevitably trade islands 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.279
 which are therefore sometimes not very legally 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.109
 so here it is hello I received time on earth a turtle earth 

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.799
 from Tunisia have yielded the information building on a 

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:27.899
 turtle who was extradited from tunisia which completely illegally 

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.919
 e as what it is about a phenomenon that is quite common they are on 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:33.979
 the forum is mostly about the form tonight the second level of the Portuguese who 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.039
 were trading exchange requests 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.039
 then these animals in the trade is forbidden 

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:47.999
 regulatory measures and that exist globally 

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:51.159
 we deliver you national good blood will be enough 

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:54.249
 but I would say that for me I would not say it's the priority if you want to 

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:56.629
 reinforce them that would already be applied this client
