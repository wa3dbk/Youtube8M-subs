according<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> botany<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.340> true<00:00:26.939> nut<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
according to botany a true nut is a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990 
according to botany a true nut is a
shelled<00:00:28.199> pod<00:00:28.500> containing<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> single<00:00:29.490> edible

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
shelled pod containing a single edible

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.519 
shelled pod containing a single edible
kernel<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> other

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
kernel there are a lot of other

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.260 
kernel there are a lot of other
characteristics<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.460> well<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
characteristics as well but that's the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200 
characteristics as well but that's the
basic<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.829> true<00:00:35.190> botanical<00:00:35.969> nut

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
basic so what is this true botanical nut

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
basic so what is this true botanical nut
and<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:37.020> isn't<00:00:37.320> we've<00:00:37.920> been<00:00:38.040> doing<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.399> all

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and what isn't we've been doing this all

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.770 
and what isn't we've been doing this all
wrong<00:00:38.879> our<00:00:39.120> whole<00:00:39.329> lives

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
wrong our whole lives

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010 
wrong our whole lives
okay<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.469> nuts<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.579> single<00:00:42.030> seeds<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.840> there

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
okay so nuts are single seeds then there

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.790 
okay so nuts are single seeds then there
are<00:00:43.140> droops

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
are droops

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
are droops
which<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.430> pits<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.239> stones<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> thing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which are like pits or stones that thing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
which are like pits or stones that thing
in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> center<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> peach<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> drupe<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in the center of a peach is a drupe and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420 
in the center of a peach is a drupe and
then<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.870> legumes<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.039> edible

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
then there are legumes which are edible

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
then there are legumes which are edible
seeds<00:00:50.730> inside<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> seed<00:00:51.809> pods<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.860> beans

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
seeds inside of seed pods think beans

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.389 
seeds inside of seed pods think beans
peas<00:00:54.000> lentils<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.980> armed<00:00:56.340> with

has spread to India Vietnam in parts of
Africa<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:07.080> delicious<00:01:07.710> snacks<00:01:08.070> are

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
Africa these delicious snacks are

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
Africa these delicious snacks are
actually<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> seeds<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.810> cashew<00:01:10.320> tree

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually the seeds of a cashew tree

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
actually the seeds of a cashew tree
which<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.130> attached<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> bottom<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
which are attached to the bottom of a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
which are attached to the bottom of a
fruit<00:01:12.659> called<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> cashew<00:01:13.619> apple<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
fruit called a cashew apple it's the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
fruit called a cashew apple it's the
seed<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> center<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> fruit<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
seed in the center of a fruit and is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.700 
seed in the center of a fruit and is
therefore<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> nut<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> drupe<00:01:18.750> cashews

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
therefore not a nut but a drupe cashews

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
therefore not a nut but a drupe cashews
grow<00:01:19.890> inside<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> shell<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.670> contain<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> very
