of all time however his movie was

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
of all time however his movie was
probably<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> worst<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
probably the worst of all of them and

probably the worst of all of them and
