read some reviews repeals though it was
to<00:02:33.730> soul<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.450> thought<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.319> was<00:02:35.440> appropriate

for the book at created suspense and
tension<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.890> think<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.549> we<00:02:39.670> got<00:02:39.849> into<00:02:40.090> the

but in the same time their characters
were<00:05:01.110> all<00:05:01.260> quite<00:05:01.440> strong<00:05:01.860> characters<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.000> they

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
were all quite strong characters so they

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.410 
were all quite strong characters so they
all<00:05:03.240> had<00:05:03.450> appealing<00:05:03.900> aspects<00:05:04.680> as<00:05:05.670> in<00:05:06.030> Edward

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.430 
Julia and Montgomery dr. Moreau had very
very<00:05:11.340> little<00:05:11.580> going<00:05:11.850> for<00:05:12.210> him<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.600> think<00:05:13.320> it's

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
very little going for him I think it's

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.140 
very little going for him I think it's
because<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.490> genre<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.820> this<00:05:14.970> book

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
because of the the genre of this book

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.700 
because of the the genre of this book
but<00:05:15.270> nobody<00:05:15.570> really<00:05:15.660> comes<00:05:15.990> under<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.410> clear

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
but nobody really comes under that clear

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.580 
but nobody really comes under that clear
a<00:05:17.070> good<00:05:17.970> guy<00:05:18.180> bad<00:05:18.390> guy<00:05:18.450> category<00:05:19.170> obviously

a good guy bad guy category obviously

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.890 
a good guy bad guy category obviously
there<00:05:19.740> are<00:05:19.770> characters<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.430> are<00:05:20.640> definitely

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
there are characters that are definitely

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.480 
there are characters that are definitely
you're<00:05:21.900> reaching<00:05:22.170> for<00:05:22.620> but<00:05:23.220> they<00:05:23.340> all<00:05:23.460> have

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
you're reaching for but they all have

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.030 
you're reaching for but they all have
something<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.420> little<00:05:24.600> bit<00:05:24.870> something<00:05:25.530> darker

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
something a little bit something darker

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.990 
something a little bit something darker
some<00:05:26.280> secrets<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.240> going<00:05:28.020> on<00:05:28.170> with<00:05:28.380> them<00:05:28.590> and

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
some secrets and going on with them and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.150 
some secrets and going on with them and
I<00:05:30.000> think<00:05:30.360> you'll<00:05:30.870> constantly<00:05:31.410> get<00:05:31.890> little

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
I think you'll constantly get little

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160 
I think you'll constantly get little
surprises<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:32.970> book<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.450> also<00:05:33.900> think

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
surprises for the book I also think

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.430 
surprises for the book I also think
there's<00:05:34.350> clues<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.870> some<00:05:36.870> things<00:05:37.140> I

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
there's clues and some things I

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.080 
there's clues and some things I
suspected<00:05:38.040> before<00:05:38.400> they<00:05:38.490> happened<00:05:38.850> other

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
suspected before they happened other

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.450 
suspected before they happened other
things<00:05:39.420> I<00:05:39.630> was<00:05:39.810> completely<00:05:40.110> shocked<00:05:40.590> by<00:05:40.860> but

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
things I was completely shocked by but

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.250 
things I was completely shocked by but
when<00:05:41.640> they<00:05:41.760> were<00:05:42.120> revealed<00:05:42.540> I<00:05:42.750> was<00:05:42.870> like<00:05:43.020> that

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
when they were revealed I was like that

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.220 
when they were revealed I was like that
makes<00:05:43.500> sense<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.250> sort<00:05:44.970> of<00:05:45.090> wanted<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.200> go

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
makes sense and sort of wanted to go

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.620 
makes sense and sort of wanted to go
back<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.560> be<00:05:46.830> like<00:05:46.860> oh<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:48.150> I'd<00:05:48.330> known<00:05:48.600> that

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
back and be like oh if I'd known that

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.470 
back and be like oh if I'd known that
then<00:05:49.170> I<00:05:49.530> think<00:05:50.040> it's<00:05:50.250> I'm<00:05:50.460> really<00:05:50.790> done<00:05:51.030> well

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
then I think it's I'm really done well

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.300 
then I think it's I'm really done well

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
like a thriller mystery at least from my

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.680 
like a thriller mystery at least from my
perspective<00:06:21.360> with<00:06:21.990> some<00:06:22.140> sort<00:06:22.320> of<00:06:22.410> gruesome

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690

elements<00:06:24.690> too<00:06:26.000> but<00:06:27.000> in<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.240> way<00:06:27.450> that<00:06:27.720> I<00:06:27.780> think

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
elements too but in a way that I think

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.080 
elements too but in a way that I think
most<00:06:28.890> people<00:06:29.160> could<00:06:29.280> treat<00:06:29.460> this<00:06:29.640> even<00:06:29.970> if

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
most people could treat this even if

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.270 
most people could treat this even if
they<00:06:30.210> weren't<00:06:30.360> really<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.780> hoarder<00:06:31.350> person
