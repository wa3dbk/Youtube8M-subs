00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 it can take months 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.249
 but the share 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 2 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.520

 the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.430
 the list too 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 it has become clear in 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 ill I heard it too

 to be made public there 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 construction 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.690

 the local market is the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.930
 2 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 every year my life also comes 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 8 yes I have the high advice I want 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.520
 but the contractor 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 at ger 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.300
 on 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.930
 the conglomerate becomes attractive 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 under the motto 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.590
 after the most benefit 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.330
 etc 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 l with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 also 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.559
 the 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.459
 I thought 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 in mind 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.919
 lod 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.919
 but I have to expand this further 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.240
 i had only 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
 ridiculous in all cases 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.840
 9 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.430
 3 cents we request 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.160
 anp 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.230
 the typical when agents go digital on the spot 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.069
 all 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.279
 nijkerk 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:18.089
 we put that says a spokesperson prevent it is over 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.789
 so the killer is a pile 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.999
 14 x finally 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.459
 beh 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.459
 on 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.499
 mpe anp here in my heart and head 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:32.639
 all 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.769
 walked 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.769
 d anp 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.909
 That 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.589
 That 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.019
 book desert 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.019
 4 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.159

 I can knock 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.140
 thirties within that happened once again pinte there I think it is 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.939
 odd that a product is ready 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.630
 the long time made after months and it says a bit more than the other 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.520
 in the Netherlands 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.840

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.779
 7 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:41.779
 to honor that hooper 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.449
 all of them 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.370
 van bommel 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.070
 after the resident 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.260
 the rocket as the room to the bottom three partners were allowed to do too 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.690

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.279
 arrived on Monday 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.490

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.900
 making a profit 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.580
 I can be underestimated 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.659

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.780
 the ordinary 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.330
 but I do know that in 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.680
 a reason 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.550
 at 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.330
 p 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.689
 to become 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.389
 Keeping a criminal record under surveillance is not getting stricter either 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.740
 the 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.490
