gobble<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:07.720> like<00:02:07.990> almost<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.440> 90<00:02:08.740> degrees<00:02:09.070> I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
gobble up like almost just 90 degrees I

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600 
gobble up like almost just 90 degrees I
feel<00:02:10.240> like<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.600> gives<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> biggest<00:02:11.610> chunk

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
feel like it gives you the biggest chunk

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
feel like it gives you the biggest chunk
of<00:02:12.730> double<00:02:13.030> up<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.780> into<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:15.010> off

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
of double up to get into and take off

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.720 
of double up to get into and take off
from<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:16.270> lot<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.810> people<00:02:16.980> prefer<00:02:17.980> more<00:02:18.370> open

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
from a lot of people prefer more open

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.880 
from a lot of people prefer more open
it's<00:02:19.300> when<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> vote<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.170> slightly<00:02:20.380> leaves

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
it's when the vote just slightly leaves

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's when the vote just slightly leaves
the<00:02:21.070> double-up<00:02:21.400> open<00:02:21.730> easier<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.180> get<00:02:22.270> into<00:02:22.480> I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
the double-up open easier to get into I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.170 
the double-up open easier to get into I
believe<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:24.160> don't<00:02:24.550> feel<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.850> there's<00:02:25.060> as

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
believe but I don't feel like there's as

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.510 
believe but I don't feel like there's as
much<00:02:25.330> pop<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.900> an<00:02:26.260> open<00:02:26.380> double<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.400> then

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
much pop on an open double up and then

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.460 
much pop on an open double up and then
nothing<00:02:27.730> worse<00:02:28.030> than<00:02:28.390> an<00:02:28.570> over<00:02:28.810> T<00:02:28.960> double<00:02:29.350> up

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
nothing worse than an over T double up

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.240 
nothing worse than an over T double up
when<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.550> boat<00:02:30.700> kind<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.060> passes<00:02:31.480> 90<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
when the boat kind of passes 90 and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.410 
when the boat kind of passes 90 and
makes<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:33.550> really<00:02:33.700> challenging<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
makes it really really challenging to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.750 
makes it really really challenging to
get<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:34.840> even<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.110> first<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.800> most<00:02:36.520> times

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
get into even the first and most times

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.240 
get into even the first and most times
you<00:02:36.940> can't<00:02:37.180> get<00:02:37.330> into<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> second<00:02:38.100> alright<00:02:39.100> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you can't get into the second alright so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.690 
you can't get into the second alright so
this<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:40.470> borderline<00:02:41.470> triple<00:02:42.040> upper<00:02:42.340> rusty

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
this is a borderline triple upper rusty

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700 
this is a borderline triple upper rusty
rusty<00:02:42.970> really<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:43.990> rusty<00:02:44.290> goes<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
rusty really this is one rusty goes the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.070 
rusty really this is one rusty goes the
biggest<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.520> you're<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.820> your<00:02:45.850> pre<00:02:46.180> turn<00:02:46.420> I'm

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
biggest so you're on your pre turn I'm

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.360 
biggest so you're on your pre turn I'm
going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.290> give<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.530> little<00:02:47.680> bit<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.070> kink

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
going to give it a little bit of a kink

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.260 
going to give it a little bit of a kink
to<00:02:48.670> these<00:02:48.820> rollers<00:02:50.490> now<00:02:51.490> what<00:02:51.670> will<00:02:51.820> happen<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
to these rollers now what will happen is

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.200 
to these rollers now what will happen is
these<00:02:52.390> rollers<00:02:52.780> will<00:02:52.960> converge<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.940> that's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
these rollers will converge and that's

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.610 
these rollers will converge and that's
the<00:02:55.360> spot<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.690> i'm<00:02:55.960> going<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.110> give<00:02:56.260> rush<00:02:56.470> in

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the spot that i'm going to give rush in

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.280 
the spot that i'm going to give rush in
the<00:02:56.710> double<00:02:57.040> up<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.280> makes<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.550> gum<00:02:57.700> up

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the double up and makes the gum up

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.870 
the double up and makes the gum up
probably<00:02:59.290> another<00:02:59.560> foot<00:02:59.890> bigger<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.670> it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
probably another foot bigger so it

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.810 
probably another foot bigger so it
allows<00:03:01.150> rusty<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.100> into<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.459> go<00:03:03.700> as

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
allows rusty to really get into it go as

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.250 
allows rusty to really get into it go as
high<00:03:03.970> as<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.150> possibly<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.930> probably<00:03:05.020> do

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
high as you possibly can and probably do

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.800 
high as you possibly can and probably do
like<00:03:05.380> an<00:03:05.530> indie<00:03:05.800> glide<00:03:06.010> or<00:03:06.220> something<00:03:06.810> really

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
like an indie glide or something really

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.160 
like an indie glide or something really
key<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.200> leave<00:03:08.380> these<00:03:08.560> open

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
key to leave these open

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.210 
key to leave these open
so<00:03:10.440> sometimes<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.950> hardest<00:03:11.160> thing<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.459> do

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.620 

make<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.460> double<00:03:19.490> up<00:03:19.880> before<00:03:20.240> you<00:03:20.390> got<00:03:20.510> to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
make it a double up before you got to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.570 
make it a double up before you got to
leave<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.900> open<00:03:21.140> because<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:22.100> makes<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.430> really

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
leave it open because it makes it really

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.370 
leave it open because it makes it really
tough<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.150> into<00:03:23.450> as<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.870> rollers<00:03:24.200> get

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
tough to get into as these rollers get

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.860 
tough to get into as these rollers get
bigger<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.920> as<00:03:25.100> your<00:03:25.340> keep<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.330> into<00:03:26.600> 90

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
bigger and as your keep going into 90

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.810 
bigger and as your keep going into 90
degrees<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.470> bigger<00:03:28.040> they<00:03:28.220> are<00:03:28.250> trying<00:03:28.700> to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
degrees so bigger they are trying to

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:37.960 
degrees so bigger they are trying to
leave<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.060> open<00:03:35.380> all<00:03:36.380> right<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.880> double<00:03:37.880> up

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
leave it open all right a double up

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.150 
leave it open all right a double up
three<00:03:38.270> rollers<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:39.470> very<00:03:39.680> first<00:03:39.920> roller

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
three rollers the very first roller

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.190 
three rollers the very first roller
definitely<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.090> easiest<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.540> get<00:03:41.690> into<00:03:42.020> I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
definitely the easiest to get into I

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.260 
definitely the easiest to get into I
would<00:03:42.350> say<00:03:42.470> for<00:03:42.710> your<00:03:42.830> beginner<00:03:42.980> go<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.180> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
too hard to get into second roller

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
too hard to get into second roller
definitely<00:03:58.940> nine<00:03:59.240> times<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.660> ten<00:03:59.720> that's

situation the only time i go for third
roller<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.810> if<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.620> second<00:04:12.950> one<00:04:13.040> doesn't<00:04:13.310> look

big enough or if as of lately trying to
double<00:04:17.030> flip<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.510> those<00:04:18.440> are<00:04:18.590> your<00:04:18.620> three

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709

double up sup you know shaping up and

double up sup you know shaping up and
it's<00:04:26.540> looking<00:04:26.660> like<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> good<00:04:27.140> one<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.470> then

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
it's looking like a good one and then

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.140 
it's looking like a good one and then
last<00:04:27.800> second<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.160> driver<00:04:28.400> makes<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.120> know

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
last second the driver makes it you know

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.570 
last second the driver makes it you know
a<00:04:29.270> little<00:04:29.540> change<00:04:29.810> he<00:04:30.380> might<00:04:30.680> over<00:04:31.130> t<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.400> just

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
a little change he might over t it just

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.880 
a little change he might over t it just
a<00:04:31.670> touch<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.690> plan<00:04:33.170> on<00:04:33.350> going<00:04:33.530> for<00:04:33.800> the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
a touch and you plan on going for the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.080 
a touch and you plan on going for the
second<00:04:34.280> or<00:04:34.370> third<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.790> you're<00:04:34.880> gonna<00:04:34.970> have

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
second or third and you're gonna have

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.610 
second or third and you're gonna have
maybe<00:04:35.300> change<00:04:35.660> really<00:04:35.900> quick<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:36.290> go<00:04:36.410> for<00:04:36.590> the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
maybe change really quick and go for the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.370 
maybe change really quick and go for the
first<00:04:36.800> roller<00:04:37.100> or<00:04:37.400> vice<00:04:38.120> versa<00:04:38.360> he<00:04:38.900> opens<00:04:39.320> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
first roller or vice versa he opens it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.470 
first roller or vice versa he opens it
up<00:04:39.500> too<00:04:39.710> much<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.400> then<00:04:40.550> when<00:04:40.880> its<00:04:41.000> open<00:04:41.180> you

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
up too much so then when its open you

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:57.480 
up too much so then when its open you
can<00:04:41.510> go<00:04:41.930> for<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.200> third<00:04:42.410> one

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.980 

so<00:04:58.490> mm<00:04:58.850> so<00:04:59.000> obviously<00:04:59.360> one<00:04:59.540> of<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.660> hardest

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
so mm so obviously one of the hardest

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.240 
so mm so obviously one of the hardest
things<00:05:00.170> they<00:05:00.230> hit<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.560> Wayborn<00:05:00.890> not<00:05:01.100> like

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
things they hit and Wayborn not like

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.980 
things they hit and Wayborn not like
your<00:05:01.400> typical<00:05:01.430> wakeboard<00:05:02.210> trick<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:02.750> takes

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
your typical wakeboard trick it takes

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.720 
your typical wakeboard trick it takes
time<00:05:03.260> experience<00:05:03.920> and<00:05:04.100> you<00:05:04.190> actually<00:05:04.340> have<00:05:04.610> to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
time experience and you actually have to

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.700 
time experience and you actually have to
watch<00:05:04.940> this<00:05:05.150> thing<00:05:05.330> happen<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:06.170> figure<00:05:06.470> it<00:05:06.590> out

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
watch this thing happen to figure it out

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.620 
watch this thing happen to figure it out
it'll<00:05:07.280> be<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> mystery<00:05:07.670> for<00:05:07.790> a<00:05:07.940> while<00:05:08.090> but<00:05:08.330> stay

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
it'll be a mystery for a while but stay

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.860 
it'll be a mystery for a while but stay
at<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.960> keep<00:05:09.560> your<00:05:09.680> finger
