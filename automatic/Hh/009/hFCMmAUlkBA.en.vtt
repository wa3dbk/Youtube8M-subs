so<00:00:00.240> we<00:00:00.359> need<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.599> get<00:00:00.719> our<00:00:00.840> rough<00:00:01.079> Florida

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
so we need to get our rough Florida

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.460 
so we need to get our rough Florida
floor<00:00:01.970> from<00:00:02.970> where<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.600> stair<00:00:03.810> starts<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
floor from where the stair starts to

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.590 
floor from where the stair starts to
where<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.740> stair<00:00:04.950> finishes<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.640> by<00:00:06.210> far<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
where the stair finishes and by far the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.330 
where the stair finishes and by far the
easiest<00:00:06.629> way<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.620> using<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> laser

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
easiest way to do that is using a laser

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.870 
easiest way to do that is using a laser
level<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.920> we're<00:00:10.920> projecting<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.580> little

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
level you see we're projecting a little

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.189 
level you see we're projecting a little
line<00:00:12.059> already<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:14.150> at<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.960> height

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
line already here at about this height

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.080 
line already here at about this height
so<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.740> quite<00:00:16.980> easily<00:00:17.240> measure<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.630> here

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
so I can quite easily measure down here

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.029 
so I can quite easily measure down here
from<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.240> landing<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.939> find<00:00:23.939> my<00:00:24.119> laser<00:00:24.359> line

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.870 

and<00:00:29.240> that<00:00:30.240> laser<00:00:30.510> line<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.500> 59<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and that laser line is at 59 and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.110 
and that laser line is at 59 and
three-quarter<00:00:33.450> inches<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
three-quarter inches and I'm going to

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
three-quarter inches and I'm going to
write<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.870> my<00:00:36.989> book<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> don't

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
write that down in my book so I don't

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.139 
write that down in my book so I don't
forget<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:40.340> start<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:41.550> page<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.059> this

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
forget it and start a new page for this

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
forget it and start a new page for this
job<00:00:49.850> then<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.149> go<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.160> my<00:00:53.309> stair

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
job then I can go to where my stair

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
job then I can go to where my stair
starts<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> measure<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
starts and I can measure up from the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:06.820 
starts and I can measure up from the
floor<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:57.170> here<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:59.210> 39<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.480> 7/8<00:01:00.960> inches

calculator which will really work for
stair<00:01:24.960> calculations<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> give

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
stair calculations and I'm going to give

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
stair calculations and I'm going to give
you<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> whole<00:01:26.880> series<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.240> keystrokes<00:01:27.720> which

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you a whole series of keystrokes which

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
you a whole series of keystrokes which
will<00:01:28.829> enable<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> layer<00:01:29.850> stair<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.329> very

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
will enable you to layer stair out very

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
will enable you to layer stair out very
accurately<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> first<00:01:32.070> thing<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
accurately so the first thing we do is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.510 
accurately so the first thing we do is
we<00:01:32.790> add<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.890> distance<00:01:34.890> from<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> second

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
we add our distance from the second

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280 
we add our distance from the second
floor<00:01:35.640> down<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> first<00:01:36.900> floor<00:01:37.049> up

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
floor down and from the first floor up

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
floor down and from the first floor up
to<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.680> raw<00:01:37.890> floor<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> floor<00:01:38.689> I'm<00:01:39.689> going

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to get our raw floor to floor I'm going

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
to get our raw floor to floor I'm going
to<00:01:39.900> push<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> clear<00:01:40.680> key<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.130> few<00:01:41.159> times<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to push the clear key a few times to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.889 
to push the clear key a few times to
make<00:01:42.000> sure<00:01:42.150> there's<00:01:42.360> nothing<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
make sure there's nothing in the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.710 
make sure there's nothing in the
calculators<00:01:43.380> memory<00:01:43.909> then<00:01:44.909> I'll<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.270> five

that's<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.899> rough<00:02:07.200> Florida<00:02:07.619> Flora

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
that's my rough Florida Flora

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.849 
that's my rough Florida Flora
okay<00:02:09.670> now<00:02:09.849> we<00:02:09.909> know<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.239> 99<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.170> 5/8<00:02:11.530> inches

okay now we know that 99 and 5/8 inches
is<00:02:12.040> our<00:02:12.219> rough<00:02:12.459> floor-to-floor<00:02:12.939> can<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:13.510> just

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
is our rough floor-to-floor can we just

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.020 
is our rough floor-to-floor can we just
divide<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.260> by<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.590> number<00:02:14.859> of<00:02:15.280> risers<00:02:15.549> and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
divide that by the number of risers and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.050 
divide that by the number of risers and
that'll<00:02:16.269> give<00:02:16.390> us<00:02:16.510> our<00:02:16.689> finish<00:02:17.650> net<00:02:18.280> rise<00:02:19.109> know

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that'll give us our finish net rise know

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.729 
that'll give us our finish net rise know
we<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.390> know<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.569> few<00:02:23.019> other<00:02:23.170> things<00:02:23.260> we

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
we have to know a few other things we

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.440 
we have to know a few other things we

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.220 
what's the thickness of the finish flow
upstairs<00:02:33.359> then<00:02:34.359> we<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.750> find<00:02:34.959> out<00:02:35.049> what<00:02:35.200> our

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
upstairs then we can find out what our

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.309 
upstairs then we can find out what our
finished<00:02:35.560> Florida<00:02:35.889> floor<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.250> let's<00:02:36.639> say<00:02:37.319> that

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
finished Florida floor is let's say that

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.390 
finished Florida floor is let's say that
this<00:02:38.500> gets<00:02:38.769> three<00:02:39.069> quarter-inch

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
this gets three quarter-inch

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.800 
this gets three quarter-inch
tongue-and-groove<00:02:40.109> so<00:02:41.109> we<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.189> add<00:02:42.400> 3/4<00:02:43.209> 299

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
tongue-and-groove so we can add 3/4 299

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.970 
tongue-and-groove so we can add 3/4 299
and<00:02:43.840> five-eighths<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:45.159> just<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:45.489> plus<00:02:46.980> 3/4

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and five-eighths we just go plus 3/4

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.229 
and five-eighths we just go plus 3/4
equals<00:02:50.069> what<00:02:51.069> about<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.519> floor<00:02:51.730> let's<00:02:52.030> say

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
equals what about this floor let's say

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.750 
equals what about this floor let's say
we<00:02:52.389> have<00:02:53.310> two<00:02:54.310> inches<00:02:54.669> of<00:02:55.319> mud<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.590> 3/4<00:02:57.370> inches
