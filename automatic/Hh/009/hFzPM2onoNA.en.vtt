my<00:02:35.519> year<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> pharmacy<00:02:36.569> student<00:02:36.599> I'll<00:02:37.140> learn

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
my year as a pharmacy student I'll learn

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.809 
my year as a pharmacy student I'll learn
about<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> different<00:02:38.129> pharmacists<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:38.670> are

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
about the different pharmacists they are

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.910 
about the different pharmacists they are
and<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.540> their<00:02:39.750> jobs<00:02:39.959> are<00:02:40.109> don't<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.739> daunted

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and what their jobs are don't be daunted

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.729 
and what their jobs are don't be daunted
viable<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.359> prospect<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:43.500> getting

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
viable and the prospect of not getting

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.650 
viable and the prospect of not getting
enough<00:02:43.889> experience<00:02:44.519> because<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.269> get<00:02:45.420> plenty

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
enough experience because you get plenty

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.089 
enough experience because you get plenty
on<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.139> course<00:02:46.349> in<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> first<00:02:46.829> year<00:02:47.040> alone

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
on the course in the first year alone

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.759 
on the course in the first year alone
and<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.170> not<00:02:49.349> as<00:02:49.440> hard<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and it's actually not as hard as it

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.759 
and it's actually not as hard as it
seems<00:02:50.180> Pharmacy<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.329> great<00:02:51.630> course<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
seems Pharmacy is a great course and I

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.500 
seems Pharmacy is a great course and I
think<00:02:53.160> anyone<00:02:53.459> who<00:02:53.760> wants<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> study<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
think anyone who wants to study it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.780 
think anyone who wants to study it
should<00:02:54.720> definitely<00:02:54.840> go<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.230> it

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
