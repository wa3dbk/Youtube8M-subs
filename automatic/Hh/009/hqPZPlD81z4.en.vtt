00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
because of course falling off of this

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
because of course falling off of this
airship<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.230> hazardous<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.520> your<00:01:54.700> health<00:01:54.850> I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and then you could knock them off and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.920 
and then you could knock them off and
hit<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.140> pic<00:02:20.320> with<00:02:20.470> them<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.540> that'll<00:02:22.750> take

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.880 

so<00:04:32.520> I'm<00:04:32.610> using<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.940> strategy<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:34.650> very

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
so I'm using a strategy that it's very

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.510 
so I'm using a strategy that it's very
simple<00:04:36.170> when<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.350> charge<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:37.920> rocket<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
simple when you charge your rocket and

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.550 
simple when you charge your rocket and
pull<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:38.940> down<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.600> do<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:39.870> spinning<00:04:40.290> attack

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
pull it down you do this spinning attack

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.350 
pull it down you do this spinning attack
thing<00:04:40.830> if<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.250> can<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.430> keep<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.120> get<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
thing if you can just keep to get the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.000 
thing if you can just keep to get the
