00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.680
 Each major airport is distinguished by its distinguishing characteristics. 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.730
 Some pilots believe that each airport runway has unique features. 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.590
 Depending on the weather and time of day. 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.320
 These attributes can be changed 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.020
 When it is sunny, it has certain characteristics, 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020
 When a storm blows, the situation becomes quite different. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.810
 And to help pilots adapt to the full runway features 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 Boeing and Embraer have worked together to develop a program 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.000
 Depends on a long-term strategy on pilot control. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.630
 This program is called "awareness of the status of the runway". 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.960
 [Marissa Jenkins, Principal Engineer in the establishment of the "Awareness of the Status of the Runway" program] The promiscuity is the main causative 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.490
 For aviation accidents in recent years. 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.010
 Disruptions occur when the plane abruptly deviates from the runway. 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.660
 It happens on the side of the runway, so called "change direction." 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.680
 Or sweep, which occurs when the plane takes off a bend at the end of the runway. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 [Speaker] Bong offers in collaboration with Embraer customers a range of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 Guidance and guidance tools for the aircraft alongside aid training and procedures 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.300
 To be followed by pilots. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.390
 The idea is to help pilots plan well for landing. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.700
 So that they can determine the status of a particular scale 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 In any weather conditions, and any time whether day or night. 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.100
 And before the aircraft reach the airport 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.420
 Pilots can make appropriate and informed decisions about how to land. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 [Genkis] The pilots were superbly trained. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 Aviation has become the safest transport, 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.110
 But the conditions that emerge are usually unpredictable. 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 [MALE SPEAKER] One of those tools illustrates the enhancement of images on a warning screen. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.950
 They include planning for the approach, layout of the runway, 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.990
 Along with guidance for stability and landing. 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.970
 [Jenkins] We should innovate because there is only one solution. 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.670
 We need to share the pilots. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.330
 We need to join regulators. 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.230
 We also need engineers 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.840
 To make the operating environment as safe as possible. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.340
 [Speaker] In the end, always bear the pilot responsibility and control of the aircraft, 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 But if this toolkit helps pilots reduce plane crashes, 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.620
 It's a program that really deserves the effort of both Boeing and Embraer. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.430
 Jinkis cooperation is the foundation. 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.250
 We as flight engineers aim to give pilots 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
 So that they can make the right decisions. 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 We strive to be the first and last line of defense 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
 When the plane takes off and lands. 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.730
