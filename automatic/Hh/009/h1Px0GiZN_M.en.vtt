tutorial today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:12.719> make<00:00:12.960> an<00:00:13.259> electric<00:00:14.009> match<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.820> your<00:00:15.059> RC

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to make an electric match for your RC

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.250 
to make an electric match for your RC
model<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.730> yeah<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.970> crack<00:00:18.180> into<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.480> this

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
model and yeah it's crack into it this

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.750 
model and yeah it's crack into it this
should<00:00:19.439> cost<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.920> hundred<00:00:20.400> dollars<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
should cost you about hundred dollars to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.330 
should cost you about hundred dollars to
make<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.500> need<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
make so first we need to get some of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.570 
make so first we need to get some of
this<00:00:23.490> steel<00:00:24.240> wool<00:00:24.510> drink<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.070> local

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this steel wool drink it from your local

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.780 
this steel wool drink it from your local
supermarket<00:00:28.670> pretty<00:00:29.670> easy<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.539> step<00:00:31.790> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
supermarket pretty easy first step it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.170 
supermarket pretty easy first step it's
just<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> cut<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.960> small<00:00:34.590> strand<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:38.180> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
just a cut a small strand out of this so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.160 
just a cut a small strand out of this so
we<00:00:39.270> end<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> strand<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
we end up with a strand like that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.150 
we end up with a strand like that
then<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.710> gonna<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.840> just<00:00:45.840> grab<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.860> case

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
then all I'm gonna do just grab my case

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.459 
then all I'm gonna do just grab my case
one<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:48.000> connectors<00:00:50.660> put<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> masking

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
one of these connectors put a masking

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.900 
one of these connectors put a masking
tape

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:09.140 

I<00:00:59.140> mean<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:00.290> join<00:01:00.620> these<00:01:00.890> two<00:01:01.790> H<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.680> eternal

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.700 

so<00:01:10.150> they<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:10.660> wear<00:01:10.840> lifts<00:01:11.170> with<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.500> do<00:01:11.590> they

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
so they all wear lifts with it do they

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.550 
so they all wear lifts with it do they
send<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.400> for<00:01:14.970> next<00:01:15.970> year<00:01:16.150> it's<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.230> hook<00:01:17.380> this

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
send that for next year it's a hook this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.730 
send that for next year it's a hook this
up<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.800> your<00:01:17.950> transmitter

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.980 

so<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.979> guess<00:01:26.869> they<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> transmitter

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
so my guess they have a transmitter

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
so my guess they have a transmitter
Icefall<00:01:30.990> -<00:01:31.229> cell<00:01:31.439> battery<00:01:32.450> which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> then

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
Icefall - cell battery which is then

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
Icefall - cell battery which is then
going<00:01:34.109> through<00:01:34.530> every<00:01:34.950> light<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
going through every light which is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.179 
going through every light which is
controlled<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.270> transmitter

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.919 

there<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.340> attacking<00:01:44.729> attack<00:01:45.060> -<00:01:45.599> so<00:01:45.719> we<00:01:45.810> can

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
there are attacking attack - so we can

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.080 
there are attacking attack - so we can
get<00:01:46.109> a<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.099> the<00:01:47.130> view<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.880> goes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
get a bit you know the view of what goes

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.830 
get a bit you know the view of what goes
on<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.170> grabbing<00:01:49.349> my<00:01:49.590> transmitter

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
on so I'm just grabbing my transmitter

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.209 
on so I'm just grabbing my transmitter
once<00:01:51.840> triggered<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.469> switch<00:01:52.799> down<00:01:53.009> here

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
once triggered by the switch down here

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.709 
once triggered by the switch down here
it<00:01:53.549> makes<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> heavens<00:01:58.250> just<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.719> so

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it makes the heavens just like that so

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
it makes the heavens just like that so
you<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.959> time<00:02:01.229> same<00:02:01.709> thing<00:02:01.739> in<00:02:02.189> its<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you this time same thing in its at this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.369 
you this time same thing in its at this
time<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> put<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> small<00:02:03.479> piece<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> juice<00:02:04.140> while

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:04.379 
time I put a small piece of juice while

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.309 
time I put a small piece of juice while
I<00:02:04.409> wrecked<00:02:04.709> in<00:02:04.950> between<00:02:05.849> the<00:02:06.030> wire<00:02:06.209> so<00:02:07.110> let's

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
I wrecked in between the wire so let's

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.509 
I wrecked in between the wire so let's
see<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.619> happens<00:02:10.160> make<00:02:11.160> sure<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> don't

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
see what happens make sure you don't

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.400 
see what happens make sure you don't
make<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.879> piece<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.239> wire<00:02:12.450> too<00:02:12.720> long<00:02:12.959> all

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
make your piece of wire too long all

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.849 
make your piece of wire too long all
your<00:02:13.530> result<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.519> this<00:02:15.200> divine<00:02:16.200> red-hot

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
your result will be this divine red-hot

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:23.449 
your result will be this divine red-hot
little<00:02:17.190> bit<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> wire<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.329> will<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:22.430> what<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
little bit of wire that will not what I

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.349 
little bit of wire that will not what I
am<00:02:23.670> using<00:02:23.819> for<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.269> has<00:02:24.720> eight<00:02:25.049> energy<00:02:26.359> on

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
am using for this has eight energy on

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.930 
am using for this has eight energy on
and<00:02:27.540> off<00:02:27.629> switch<00:02:27.989> with<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> relay<00:02:28.889> inside<00:02:29.250> I
