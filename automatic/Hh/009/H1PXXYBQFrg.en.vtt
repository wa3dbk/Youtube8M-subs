00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.370
 the word I colate comes from an ancient term meaning water 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 bitter 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.880
 because the cocoa beans that are used to make it have it 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.140
 originally bitter taste 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.210
 then how do they manage to transform these hard and bitter grains into a bar 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 sweet and creamy chocolate 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 no matter what kind of chocolate is made from milk chocolate 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.040
 until bitter chocolate they all start with the seeds of the cacao tree that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 they are commonly known as cocoa beans 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.130
 the grains arrive at the factory of chocolates tecos 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.109
 from the tropics where these trees grow 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.360
 as africa 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 yes mexico and south america 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.010
 if they do not have one of them now the taste would be very bitter 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 the transformation of bitter grains into chocolate begins when it is grazed 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 Reds inside a smoking machine 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.910
 It makes you vibrate the grains until you get the frit husk inside of 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.370
 miles works 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.400
 It is known as pulp and it is the part of the grain that contains all the flavor of the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.380
 chocolate 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.330
 once you brad the beans the husk if the faults are separated 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.430
 about migratory filters 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 the longer and lighter covers are on top of the filter and are 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.079
 eliminated 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.549
 while the smaller and heavier faults fall down 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.849
 to release the flavor of the guilts are toasted in a similar giant toaster 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.159
 which is used for coffee 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.129
 the exact time and temperature of toasting is the best preserved secret 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.399
 of chocolate makers 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.829
 because controlling these two variables implies controlling their taste 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.030
 another closely guarded secret is how it is done that is currently for 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.959
 transform the roasted beans into a thick chocolate-like liquid 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.529
 although it is done in a very similar way to the transformation of the hands 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.669
 fluffy in peanut butter 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.239
 cb tasty but this mixture known as the chocolate of the bakers is 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.619
 bitter sweet nothing 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.779
 jennings to sweeten the liquid is mixed with sugar and other ingredients 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.779
 inside a giant one-ton mixer 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:13.169
 until it becomes a sweet chocolate paste expresses and we will let you know 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.889
 the paste ejects like chocolate but nothing creamy 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.059
 the sandy texture is gradually worked with a series of five 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.159
 rollers 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.909
 you have to press the paste to remove the moisture and to refine it in 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.939
 increasingly smaller particles 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.779
 when finished they are reduced to a fine and dry powder with which they can be 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.779
 prepare a delicious cup of hot chocolate 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.469
 to transform the chocolate powder chocolate bars 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.909
 a conveyor belt moves it to the most important machine in the 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.929
 chocolate manufacturing process 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.069
 Car 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.929
 within the concept of powder banks with cocoa butter made with oil 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.109
 of cocoa beans and with other creamy ingredients 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.189
 that mix slowly for hours and even days 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.909
 to obtain the soft and creamy texture of the chocolate 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.760
 the constant friction between the plateau and the pallets of the machine produces friction 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.870
 and heat that leads a bad taste while or addicted to chocolate 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.139
 the longer the chocolate mix, the more creamy the result 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.139
 fairer or and more expensive 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.789
 after 16 hours - of course this chocolate is ready to transform 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.419
 in barbastro 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.569
 the machine fills 336 amounts per minute 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.740
 the field more than two hundred thousand bars of chocolate per day 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.160
 a quick step through the cooling tunnel hardens the chocolate 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.439
 another machine works equally fast wrapping the chocolate bars 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.880
 the silver paper you will find most of the bars that serve 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.010
 preserve chocolate by protecting it from moisture identity 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.740
 a decorative envelope is placed on top of that paper and then the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.650
 bitter seeds are ready to get rid of the mouth
