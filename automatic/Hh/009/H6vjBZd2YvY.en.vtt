dot and I twirl the saran wrap around so
that<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:28.140> pattern

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that I get some of it going in a pattern

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
that I get some of it going in a pattern
that<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.610> resemble<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> rose<00:01:30.540> or

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
that would kind of resemble a rose or

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.190 
that would kind of resemble a rose or
flower<00:01:31.530> leaves<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.360> mash<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.960> down

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
flower leaves and then I mash it down

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
flower leaves and then I mash it down
into<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:35.100> wet<00:01:35.520> wash<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.840> I'm<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
into the very wet wash and I'm going to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.249 
into the very wet wash and I'm going to
do<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.710> each<00:01:40.829> flower<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.780> one

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
do this for each flower this is just one

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
do this for each flower this is just one
way<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:44.070> saran<00:01:44.520> wrap<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:46.110> gives<00:01:46.320> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
way you can use saran wrap that gives it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
way you can use saran wrap that gives it
a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.740> hint<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> direction<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:49.460> mash<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a little hint of direction I mash it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:02.109 
a little hint of direction I mash it
down<00:01:50.700> firmly

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.630 

and<00:02:03.440> now<00:02:04.440> I'm<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.100> let<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.369> dry<00:02:05.610> for

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and now I'm going to let it dry for

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:16.070 
and now I'm going to let it dry for
about<00:02:05.970> 20<00:02:06.540> minutes<00:02:06.840> okay<00:02:13.880> now<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.090> dry<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.930> at

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
least the pain is set and I'm going to

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.240 
least the pain is set and I'm going to
pull<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> saran<00:02:19.260> wrap<00:02:19.470> off<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.950> we'll<00:02:20.069> see

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
pull the saran wrap off and we'll see

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.690 
pull the saran wrap off and we'll see
what<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.550> have<00:02:25.550> okay

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
what we have okay

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.059 
what we have okay
this<00:02:27.209> didn't<00:02:27.690> create<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.989> lot<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.560> texture<00:02:29.040> but

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
this didn't create a lot of texture but

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.510 
this didn't create a lot of texture but
there's<00:02:29.430> some<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.850> there<00:02:30.709> in<00:02:31.709> order<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.250> create

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
there's some in there in order to create

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.380 
there's some in there in order to create
the<00:02:32.820> flower<00:02:33.030> shapes<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.900> kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.830> draw<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.580> what

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the flower shapes I kind of draw on what

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.030 
the flower shapes I kind of draw on what
I<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.870> looks<00:02:37.050> like<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> flower<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
I think looks like a flower with the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
I think looks like a flower with the
pencil<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.860> paint<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.280> between<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.940> I'm

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
pencil now to paint in between them I'm

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.940 
pencil now to paint in between them I'm
going<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.300> switch<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.870> smaller<00:02:46.110> brush<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
going to switch to a smaller brush and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.520 
going to switch to a smaller brush and
I'll<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.910> using<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.390> same<00:02:48.690> colors<00:02:49.140> plus

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I'll be using the same colors plus

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.520 
I'll be using the same colors plus
phthalo<00:02:50.160> blue<00:02:50.190> which<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> lot<00:02:51.269> darker

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.699 

drawing<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.800> few<00:02:56.220> leaves<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.440> think

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
drawing on a few leaves and I think

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.199 
drawing on a few leaves and I think
about<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.670> want<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> leaves

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
about it I really want the leaves

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.479 
about it I really want the leaves
separated<00:03:04.110> from<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.500> flower<00:03:04.799> since<00:03:05.190> this

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
separated from the flower since this

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.860 
separated from the flower since this
flower<00:03:05.790> has<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> lot<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.390> yellow<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
flower has a lot of yellow in it so I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.350 
flower has a lot of yellow in it so I
put<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> hint<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.709> shadow<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.060> side<00:03:12.329> of

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
put a hint of a shadow on the side of

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.310 
put a hint of a shadow on the side of
the<00:03:12.630> flower<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:17.239> then<00:03:18.239> clean<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.750> brush<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the flower and then clean my brush and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.670 
the flower and then clean my brush and
add<00:03:19.530> water<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:21.049> don't<00:03:22.049> want<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.470> lot<00:03:22.650> of

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
add water you don't want a lot of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.509 
add water you don't want a lot of
definite<00:03:23.400> edges<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.480> leaves<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.519> want

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
definite edges in your leaves you want

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.120 
definite edges in your leaves you want
things<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.090> appear<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.660> disappear<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.530> so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
things that appear and disappear and so

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
things that appear and disappear and so
if<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.400> lay<00:03:29.579> down<00:03:29.609> color<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.450> then<00:03:31.170> add<00:03:31.350> water

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
if you lay down color and then add water

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.160 
if you lay down color and then add water
and<00:03:32.010> let<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.370> dissolve<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:33.209> you'll<00:03:33.930> have<00:03:34.140> a

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and let it dissolve out you'll have a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.430 
and let it dissolve out you'll have a
nice<00:03:34.410> look

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.710 

and<00:03:40.540> put<00:03:41.540> down<00:03:41.810> some<00:03:41.840> hints<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.500> color<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:43.720> add

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720

00:03:44.720 --> 00:05:36.250 
and put down some hints of color and add
water

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.620 

and<00:05:36.350> it's<00:05:37.100> just<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.550> very<00:05:37.730> intuitive<00:05:38.240> process

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
and it's just a very intuitive process

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.330 
and it's just a very intuitive process
having<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.990> pattern<00:05:42.470> made<00:05:42.710> by<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.010> plastic

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
having the pattern made by the plastic

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.530 
having the pattern made by the plastic
wrap<00:05:44.140> can<00:05:45.140> give<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.530> hints<00:05:46.190> as<00:05:46.340> to<00:05:46.540> some

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
wrap can give you hints as to some

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.290 
wrap can give you hints as to some
directions<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.290> might<00:05:48.500> want<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.830> take<00:05:49.300> it's

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
fun to follow the lines the plastic wrap

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.470 
fun to follow the lines the plastic wrap
created<00:05:56.980> but<00:05:57.980> what<00:05:58.160> makes<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.580> nice<00:05:58.790> picture<00:05:59.120> is

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
created but what makes a nice picture is

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.370 
created but what makes a nice picture is
a<00:05:59.540> unified<00:06:00.320> color<00:06:00.650> scheme<00:06:01.840> sticking<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:03.020> a<00:06:03.050> few

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
a unified color scheme sticking to a few

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.580 
a unified color scheme sticking to a few
colors<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:04.840> letting<00:06:05.840> them<00:06:05.990> appear<00:06:06.440> and

disappear<00:06:06.740> throughout<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.790> composition

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.210 

most<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.400> this<00:06:13.550> is<00:06:13.760> going<00:06:14.030> to<00:06:14.120> be<00:06:14.300> light<00:06:14.570> in

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
most of this is going to be light in

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.990 
most of this is going to be light in
value<00:06:16.220> but<00:06:16.970> a<00:06:17.000> few<00:06:17.270> dark<00:06:17.600> areas<00:06:18.670> will<00:06:19.670> make<00:06:19.850> the

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
value but a few dark areas will make the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.560 
value but a few dark areas will make the
rest<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.390> it<00:06:20.540> pop<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:22.060> help<00:06:23.060> lead<00:06:23.330> your
