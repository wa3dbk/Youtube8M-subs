milk will not separate into coconut
cream<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.709> water<00:00:14.010> so<00:00:14.760> this<00:00:15.119> is<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.270> pretty

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and you open it up it's nothing more

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.370 
and you open it up it's nothing more
than<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.330> soupy<00:00:42.870> mess<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> why<00:00:45.210> does<00:00:45.810> some

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
than a soupy mess so why does some

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.500 
than a soupy mess so why does some
coconut<00:00:46.950> milk<00:00:46.980> solidify<00:00:47.790> at<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> top<00:00:48.240> while

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
coconut milk solidify at the top while

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.590 
coconut milk solidify at the top while
others<00:00:49.100> don't<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.180> little

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
others don't and it has to do a little

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.880 
others don't and it has to do a little
bit<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.900> science<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> I'll<00:00:52.560> fill<00:00:52.740> you<00:00:52.770> in

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
bit with science so I'll fill you in

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
bit with science so I'll fill you in
really<00:00:53.280> quick<00:00:53.490> so<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:54.330> they<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.660> coconut

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
really quick so how they make coconut

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.320 
really quick so how they make coconut
milk<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.380> they<00:00:55.560> take<00:00:55.740> water<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.430> blend<00:00:57.150> it

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
milk is they take water and blend it

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.360 
milk is they take water and blend it
with<00:00:57.510> coconut<00:00:58.110> meat<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.800> coconut<00:00:59.220> meat

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
with coconut meat the coconut meat

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.730 
with coconut meat the coconut meat
contains<00:00:59.880> most<00:01:00.450> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> fats<00:01:00.990> right<00:01:01.470> so<00:01:01.650> we

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
contains most of the fats right so we

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.230 
contains most of the fats right so we
know<00:01:01.830> coconuts<00:01:02.310> a<00:01:02.400> source<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.790> healthy<00:01:03.060> fat

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 
know coconuts a source of healthy fat

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.249 
know coconuts a source of healthy fat
like<00:01:03.930> mct<00:01:04.470> oil<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.450> saturated<00:01:06.450> fat<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.140> you've

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
like mct oil and saturated fat so you've

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.209 
like mct oil and saturated fat so you've
got<00:01:07.289> this<00:01:07.560> fatty<00:01:08.749> liquid<00:01:09.749> now<00:01:10.560> combined<00:01:11.039> with

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
got this fatty liquid now combined with

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.219 
got this fatty liquid now combined with
water<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.789> if<00:01:12.359> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.570> anything<00:01:12.780> about<00:01:12.929> oil

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
water and if you know anything about oil

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.880 
water and if you know anything about oil
and<00:01:13.469> water<00:01:13.649> oil<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:15.210> nonpolar<00:01:15.659> water<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> polar

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and water oil is nonpolar water is polar

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
and water oil is nonpolar water is polar
and<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:17.969> have<00:01:18.179> opposite<00:01:18.719> polarities

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and if they have opposite polarities

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.249 
and if they have opposite polarities
they<00:01:19.560> don't<00:01:19.799> mix<00:01:20.039> so<00:01:20.579> this<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.850> why<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.359> oil<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
they don't mix so this is why an oil and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.050 
they don't mix so this is why an oil and
vinegar<00:01:22.409> based<00:01:22.829> salad<00:01:23.130> dressing<00:01:23.640> will

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
vinegar based salad dressing will

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.630 
vinegar based salad dressing will
separate<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.539> even<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.319> you<00:01:25.560> shake<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
separate out even if you shake it very

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
separate out even if you shake it very
vigorously<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.539> let<00:01:27.719> it<00:01:27.810> sit<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.229> while

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
vigorously if you let it sit for a while

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.629 
vigorously if you let it sit for a while
it's<00:01:28.679> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.219> separate<00:01:29.719> now<00:01:30.719> if<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.039> buy<00:01:32.249> a

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:32.639 
it's going to separate now if you buy a

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.429 
it's going to separate now if you buy a
brand<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> coconut<00:01:33.569> milk<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
brand of coconut milk that's just

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.969 
brand of coconut milk that's just
coconut<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.189> water<00:01:36.200> you'll<00:01:37.200> usually<00:01:37.469> get<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
coconut and water you'll usually get the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.730 
coconut and water you'll usually get the
cream<00:01:38.219> on<00:01:38.399> top<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.450> most<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.319> brands<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cream on top but most of the brands that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.209 
cream on top but most of the brands that
are<00:01:40.920> sold<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.429> contain<00:01:42.359> emulsifiers<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.069> an

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
are sold now contain emulsifiers so an

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.879 
are sold now contain emulsifiers so an
emulsifier<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.569> chemical<00:01:46.049> compound<00:01:46.200> whose

emulsifier is a chemical compound whose

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.489 
emulsifier is a chemical compound whose
job<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:48.149> make<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.840> fat<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
job it is to actually make that fat and

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.440 
job it is to actually make that fat and
water<00:01:50.039> layer<00:01:50.459> play<00:01:51.090> nicely<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.869> mix<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
water layer play nicely and mix and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.550 
water layer play nicely and mix and
while<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> might<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.959> good<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.350> some

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
while that might be good in some

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219 
while that might be good in some
applications<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.399> others<00:01:56.819> it's<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.389> so<00:01:58.079> if

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
applications in others it's not so if

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.359 
applications in others it's not so if
you<00:01:58.350> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.889> of<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.340> of
