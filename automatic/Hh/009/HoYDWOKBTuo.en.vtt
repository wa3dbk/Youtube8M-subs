00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
already I'm thinking when you go for a

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.380 
already I'm thinking when you go for a
forward<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.530> start<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.859> off<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> top<00:03:14.370> agent<00:03:14.670> cuz

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
forward to start it off a top agent cuz

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.630 
forward to start it off a top agent cuz
that's<00:03:15.510> all<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.049> forwards<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.010> those

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that's all the forwards not just those

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.420 
that's all the forwards not just those
few<00:03:18.390> exclusive<00:03:19.049> stars<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.130> let's<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.400> go

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
few exclusive stars so let's just go

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.099 
few exclusive stars so let's just go

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
ahead and just give it a try we'll just

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.310 
ahead and just give it a try we'll just
pay<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.530> our<00:03:22.859> our<00:03:23.100> GP<00:03:24.030> I'm<00:03:24.720> feeling<00:03:25.200> good

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
though feeling good about something as

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.910 
though feeling good about something as
you<00:03:29.819> can<00:03:29.970> see<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.510> our<00:03:30.750> last<00:03:31.049> spin<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.590> was<00:03:31.680> all

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you can see on our last spin it was all

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.550 
you can see on our last spin it was all
like<00:03:32.340> white<00:03:32.609> bronze<00:03:32.940> silver<00:03:33.450> now<00:03:34.170> we<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.470> got

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
like white bronze silver now we just got

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.860 
like white bronze silver now we just got
black<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.280> gold<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.030> our<00:03:36.120> chances<00:03:36.569> are<00:03:36.690> much

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
black and gold so our chances are much

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
black and gold so our chances are much
higher<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.470> don't<00:03:37.920> know<00:03:38.100> what<00:03:38.310> we'll<00:03:38.459> get<00:03:38.609> was

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
higher I don't know what we'll get was

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.410 
higher I don't know what we'll get was
at<00:03:39.120> least<00:03:39.299> hope<00:03:39.569> for<00:03:39.870> someone<00:03:40.530> decent

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
at least hope for someone decent

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.050 
at least hope for someone decent
only<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> goal<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.740> start<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.550> alright<00:03:45.790> it's

through<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:49.000> few<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.300> them<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:50.709> back<00:03:50.860> on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
through a few of them get back on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.870 
through a few of them get back on
something<00:03:51.489> big<00:03:51.760> soon<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.370> physical

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
something big soon and that physical
