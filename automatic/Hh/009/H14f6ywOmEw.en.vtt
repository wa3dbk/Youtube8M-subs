 hello to all and koumassi today 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.350
 we find ourselves for a video a little 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.240
 special since it is a video 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 thanks to three people 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 with whom I really get along great 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.550
 well then we will type right away and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.890
 with Mr. Tech 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 so sir tex and he's a guy with 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.800
 which I have a lot of points in common 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 we talked through the tutorial where acf 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.700
 he asked me if I would agree 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 to return one or two tutorials what 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.300
 I did and then we went quickly 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.329
 close on skype 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.520
 we had projects together so 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.900
 projects like apple news right now 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.530
 we are a little in post on apple news 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.880
 moment but that should not be long in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.729

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.360
 evenings on skype 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.390
