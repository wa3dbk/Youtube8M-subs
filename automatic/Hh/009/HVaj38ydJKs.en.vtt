00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello welcome sao like today 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.340
 I will teach a little magic game that 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.100
 you can do in this case with a deck 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.370
 of letters 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.060
 what we are going to do 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.770
 it's an invisible control I'll ask you 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.360
 that you notice well we are going to use in this 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:30.260
 case two letters for example is here and 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.440
 we are going to use the 6 and 7 of spades and 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.040
 shamrocks what we are going to do is what 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.020
 next we are going to place 6 and 7 of spades 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.510
 and clubs through the center of the deck 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.960
 so that then you have to be 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.390
 very attentive because you are going to see the control 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.450
 invisible 6 and 7 of spades and clubs 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.700
 lost 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.180
 in the middle the deck until the last 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.900
 moment 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.470
 you are not going to see any kind of movement 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.140
 strange 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.519
 It seems that they are lost but I still 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.130
 I can see in what position they are 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.649
 and with a simple gesture such that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 unintentionally the 6 and 7 of spades and 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.930
 shamrocks go up 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's not so it's a little game that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.820
 really when you know the secret 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.270
 you think this is impossible for people 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.090
 you like it because it 's very silly but this 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.040
 It also explains part of the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
 philosophy of magic that consists of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.860
 divert attention from what is not 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 we want people to see to do the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.490
 game we need four cards 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.909
 we need 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:50.689
 the 266 blacks and the 27 blacks 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.869
 then we have the 7 of spades 7 of 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.479
 clubs 6 of spades 6 of clubs and what 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.119
 what we are going to do is catch the 6 of spades 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.730
 and the 7 of clubs and we'll put them 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.400
 above 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.880
 and the other two will be lost by the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.710
 medium in any position and once 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.020
 have this so you can start the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.300
 game the question is that 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.180
 you are going to take 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 from the deck of 6 of clubs and 7 of 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.170
 spades 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.590
 and what you say is very important 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 verbally because you say 6 and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.710
 7 of spades and clubs you do not say 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.810
 the 6 of clubs of the 7 of spades but 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.170
 you say 6 and 7 of spades and clubs 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.060
 because this then confuse at the end 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.760
 you have the two letters and what you have 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.770
 what to do simply with a lot 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 clarity so that people can be 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.830
 observing closely you put the two 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.060
 lost letters by the center and going 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.370
 repeating the 6 and 7 of spades and clubs 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.160
 and you lose very slowly that people 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.040
 look closely as much as you want 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.020
 you lose the cards by the center is very 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.140
 important that you make some movement 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.660
 a bit strange or a little magical me 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.850
 I usually pick up the letters and make a 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.060
 small twist that does not help but 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.550
 give that the touch of saying there has done 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.160
 something weird 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.050
 and once you have the two lost cards 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200
 all you have to do is give a 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.410
 click and say and the 6 and 7 of spades and 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.090
 shamrocks go up 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.740
 these two letters are not the same as 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.260
 you have put in the center but they are 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.330
 those you had already prepared but the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.060
 people will not remember because the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.670
 concordance is that you have the 6 and 7 of 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.280
 spades and clubs and that's where the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.150
 small verbal deception that you carry 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.709
 doing throughout the game 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.720
 I know some of you do not 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.000
 will convince you will say this the best ever 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.650
 it will work is impossible I recommend you 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.810
 that you try it 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.519
 and you'll tell me how it goes thanks 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.519
 for watching the video and has been working
