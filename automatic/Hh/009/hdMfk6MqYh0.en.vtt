butterfly<00:02:09.479> variation<00:02:10.110> loop<00:02:10.649> itself<00:02:10.950> looks

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
butterfly variation loop itself looks

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.870 
butterfly variation loop itself looks
like<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.730 

okay<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.150> unlike<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.810> regular<00:02:21.050> butterfly

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
okay so unlike the regular butterfly

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.190 
okay so unlike the regular butterfly
balance<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:23.000> has<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.480> little<00:02:23.690> bit<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
balance this one has a little bit of the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.350 
balance this one has a little bit of the
swing<00:02:24.530> motion<00:02:24.800> put<00:02:25.160> into<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.000> let's<00:02:26.209> get

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
swing motion put into it so let's get

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.910 
swing motion put into it so let's get
started<00:02:26.780> first<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.800> your

heels put together like this not all the
way<00:02:31.130> touching<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.970> relatively<00:02:32.840> close

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
way touching but just relatively close

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.300 
way touching but just relatively close

one-and-two nice and simple so the next

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.840 
one-and-two nice and simple so the next
motion<00:03:08.959> here<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.590> swing<00:03:09.950> motion<00:03:10.190> we're

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
motion here is the swing motion we're

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.090 
motion here is the swing motion we're
going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> be<00:03:11.180> leading<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:11.540> our<00:03:11.810> hips<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:12.650> our

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
going to be leading with our hips so our

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.490 
going to be leading with our hips so our
hips<00:03:13.370> going<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.910> go<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.090> one<00:03:14.330> side<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:15.350> then

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
hips going to go to one side and then

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.020 
hips going to go to one side and then
once<00:03:15.709> we're<00:03:15.890> here<00:03:16.069> we're<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.580> go<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
once we're here we're going to go to the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.880 
once we're here we're going to go to the
other<00:03:17.150> side<00:03:17.450> alright<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.380> when<00:03:18.620> you're<00:03:18.769> doing

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
other side alright so when you're doing

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.410 
other side alright so when you're doing
this<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.549> want<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.760> make<00:03:19.910> sure<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.269> your

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
this you want to make sure that your

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.539 
this you want to make sure that your
upper<00:03:20.600> body<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:21.140> loose<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.130> can<00:03:22.340> create

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
upper body is loose so you can create

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.509 
upper body is loose so you can create
that<00:03:22.730> same<00:03:23.030> motion<00:03:23.299> alright<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.890> you're

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
that same motion alright so you're

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.720 
that same motion alright so you're
getting<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.030> power<00:03:26.299> from<00:03:26.720> pushing<00:03:27.320> off<00:03:27.500> your

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
getting the power from pushing off your

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.280 
getting the power from pushing off your
opposite<00:03:28.730> leg<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.780> you're<00:03:29.959> going<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.200> go

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
opposite leg so if you're going to go

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.259 
opposite leg so if you're going to go
this<00:03:30.859> way<00:03:31.130> you're<00:03:31.519> going<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.730> push<00:03:31.850> off<00:03:32.000> this

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
this way you're going to push off this

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.199 
this way you're going to push off this
leg<00:03:32.540> pull<00:03:32.989> like<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.459> can<00:03:34.640> see<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.970> subtle

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
leg pull like so you can see the subtle

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.259 
leg pull like so you can see the subtle
movement<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.019> boom<00:03:36.440> pushing<00:03:37.310> off<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.120> then

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
movement so boom pushing off and then

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.620 
movement so boom pushing off and then
the<00:03:38.390> other<00:03:38.570> side<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:38.989> 1<00:03:39.410> &amp;<00:03:39.829> 2<00:03:40.280> 1<00:03:41.180> &amp;<00:03:41.239> 2<00:03:41.859> 1<00:03:42.859> &amp;<00:03:42.920> 2<00:03:43.570> 1<00:03:44.570> &amp;

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
the other side so 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp;

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.800 
the other side so 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp;
2<00:03:45.380> ok<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.549> second<00:03:46.880> movement<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.510> first

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
2 ok so the second movement or the first

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.539 
2 ok so the second movement or the first
movement<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.320> should<00:03:48.530> say<00:03:48.680> add<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.280> into<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
movement I should say add it into the

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.130 
movement I should say add it into the
second<00:03:50.000> movement<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.660> going<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.900> look<00:03:51.019> like

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
second movement it's going to look like

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.660 
second movement it's going to look like
this<00:03:51.350> boom<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.280> boom

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.060 

so<00:03:57.670> one<00:03:58.000> two<00:03:58.660> one<00:03:59.470> two<00:03:59.740> one<00:04:00.370> two<00:04:01.240> one<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.710> two

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
so one two one two one two one and two

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.950 
so one two one two one two one and two
all<00:04:03.550> right<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.240> takes<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.540> little<00:04:04.690> bit<00:04:04.840> of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
all right so it takes a little bit of

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.540 
all right so it takes a little bit of
practice<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.710> want<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:05.950> get<00:04:06.100> down<00:04:06.280> these

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
practice you want to get down these

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.580 
practice you want to get down these
regular<00:04:07.540> bouncing<00:04:07.990> motion<00:04:08.140> for<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
regular bouncing motion for the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.380 
regular bouncing motion for the
butterfly<00:04:09.010> bounce<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.610> as<00:04:10.150> you're<00:04:10.300> doing

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
butterfly bounce and as you're doing

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.430 
butterfly bounce and as you're doing
this<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:11.350> want<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> sway<00:04:12.120> sway<00:04:13.120> sway<00:04:13.440> and

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
this you want to sway sway sway and

variation<00:04:23.620> now<00:04:24.040> this<00:04:24.250> one<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.640> perfect<00:04:25.120> with

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
variation now this one is perfect with

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.760 
variation now this one is perfect with
the<00:04:25.390> icing<00:04:25.660> with<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> group<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.230> friends<00:04:26.500> when

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
the icing with a group of friends when

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.950 
the icing with a group of friends when
you<00:04:26.950> are<00:04:26.980> out<00:04:27.370> at<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.640> social<00:04:28.030> function<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.840> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
you are out at a social function so the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:40.350 
you are out at a social function so the
move<00:04:29.140> itself<00:04:29.410> looks<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.740> this<00:04:39.090> all<00:04:40.090> right<00:04:40.270> so

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
move itself looks like this all right so

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.240 
move itself looks like this all right so
you<00:04:40.450> can<00:04:40.480> tell<00:04:40.810> my<00:04:40.930> body<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.320> turning<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.890> every

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
turning my body all the way to the other

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.800 
turning my body all the way to the other
side<00:06:24.770> so<00:06:25.490> make<00:06:25.880> sure<00:06:25.910> you're<00:06:26.389> going<00:06:26.539> to<00:06:26.600> be

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
side so make sure you're going to be

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.990 
side so make sure you're going to be
doing<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.500> up<00:06:27.710> and<00:06:28.039> up<00:06:28.190> balance<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.669> entire

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
doing the up and up balance the entire

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.879 
doing the up and up balance the entire
time<00:06:29.300> or<00:06:29.720> else<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.080> move<00:06:30.260> will<00:06:30.470> not<00:06:30.500> look<00:06:30.830> good

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
time or else the move will not look good

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.520 
time or else the move will not look good
alright<00:06:31.520> so<00:06:31.580> that<00:06:31.970> is<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.630> step<00:06:33.380> touch

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
alright so that is the step touch

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.220 
alright so that is the step touch
variation
