00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
I've been pretty impressed with what

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.280 
I've been pretty impressed with what
I've<00:00:49.430> seen<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:49.730> far<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.690> also<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:51.110> the

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
I've seen so far and I also like the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.650 
I've seen so far and I also like the
fact<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.680> he's<00:00:52.100> abandoned<00:00:52.910> his<00:00:53.120> grand<00:00:53.450> plan

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
fact that he's abandoned his grand plan

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.260 
fact that he's abandoned his grand plan
to<00:00:54.020> be<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.230> striker<00:00:54.800> he's<00:00:55.640> going<00:00:55.910> back<00:00:56.060> to<00:00:56.120> his

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
to be a striker he's going back to his

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.000 
to be a striker he's going back to his
roots<00:00:56.630> he's<00:00:57.050> going<00:00:57.380> take<00:00:57.590> down<00:00:57.800> he's<00:00:57.950> going

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
roots he's going take down he's going

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.920 
roots he's going take down he's going
submission<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.000> haven't<00:00:59.210> seen<00:00:59.330> it<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.480> lot<00:00:59.630> yet

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
submission we haven't seen it a lot yet

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.510 
submission we haven't seen it a lot yet
but<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.470> know<00:01:00.560> he's<00:01:00.680> been<00:01:00.800> very<00:01:01.040> vocal<00:01:01.280> about

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
but you know he's been very vocal about

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400 
but you know he's been very vocal about
that's<00:01:02.150> his<00:01:02.390> game<00:01:02.600> plan<00:01:02.660> here<00:01:03.110> now<00:01:03.260> at

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's his game plan here now at

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.689 
that's his game plan here now at
welterweight<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.309> think<00:01:04.489> that's<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
welterweight and I think that's the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.160 
welterweight and I think that's the
right<00:01:04.820> game<00:01:05.059> plan<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.570> think<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:05.990> is

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
right game plan and I think that is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.960 
right game plan and I think that is
going<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.950> take<00:01:07.130> him<00:01:07.310> far<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.759> certainly

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
going to take him far and I certainly

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.789 
going to take him far and I certainly
think<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.420> takes<00:01:08.600> him<00:01:08.750> over<00:01:08.869> Rick<00:01:09.200> story<00:01:09.500> who

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
think it takes him over Rick story who

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.679 
think it takes him over Rick story who
do<00:01:10.670> not<00:01:10.790> believe<00:01:11.060> has<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.420> kind<00:01:11.540> of

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
do not believe has the kind of

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.240 
do not believe has the kind of
submission<00:01:12.110> defense<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.590> can<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:13.220> know

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
submission defense that can you know

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.130
