00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.550
 shown as they are under linux the 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.009
 microsoft fonts can use 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.300
 not all but the common ones we are 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.730
 asked by a spectator afterwards 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.980
 because he has the font areal on 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.619
 his linux system did not find 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.629
 he had searched because areal often 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.399
 he wants to be used in applications 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.280
 well that and well did not find it 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.620
 now microsoft keeps the right one at the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.960
 Font areal why it is this 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.879
 by default only stops in windows 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 Of course, there are equivalents 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.469
 fonts also among others 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.969
 operating systems for areal if i do that 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.920
 is also really remembered 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.469
 only a copied font of the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.210
 appropriate writing on the mac 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.379
 I mean I heard something but times 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.909
 please no war in the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.609
 comments from because of him has jehovah 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.890
 So nobody said throw any stone 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.710
 before i whistle in that whistle 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.909
 where was i the font the okay 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 camera of course without problems 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.620
 I install shows that here 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.510
 but now under linux mint does that 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.290
 even now in the terminal so it 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.210
 Everywhere works in every linux 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 the one possibility would be via the menu 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.590
 first the software administration 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.950
 I have to call her enjoyed password 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.950
 enter 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.860
 I can either search here now 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 to msc for microsoft truetype or 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.410
 here I have right fonts now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.860
 there we have the whole thing when I'm here 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.630
 directly above already already first 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.160
 offered package 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.930
 the others are also very beautiful 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.270
 You can definitely write fonts 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 so just look at that here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 a double click install so here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.780
 click on it or just above the terminal 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 as I said for those who do that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 maybe not on your software 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 find administration 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.260
 I'll give you that and that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.580
 corresponding command you will find 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.450
 Of course, again about the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:10.130
 description linked solo - get 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:13.960
 install and at the msc choir and at the beginning 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.970
 of course the password 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.530
 but the whole thing installed after me 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.990
 confirmed again here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.480
 Of course, that has to be confirmed 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.480
 Microsoft brings its own role 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.670
 and if my prompt 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.709
 I have everything back here 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.480
 do not do any mistakes then we can 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.250
 So check now 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.900
 although the appropriate font 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.730
 can now buy here directly times the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.530
 fonts should 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.049
 and here we have areal arial 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.549
 black and so on and so on is so 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.549
 just okay
