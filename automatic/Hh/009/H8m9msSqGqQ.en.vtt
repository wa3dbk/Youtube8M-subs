00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello dear friends with you doctor 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 from and in as you already understood our second 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.219
 part of the bugs heading in games today 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.920
 show battlefield 4 battlefield 4 as 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.520
 you already know there are very very many 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 bugs but this time I will tell you about 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.519
 texture textures it seemed to me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.000
 fun and I found a lot of them but 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.000
 I'll show you only 3 so I went 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.469
 The first texture tank is on the map. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 zavod 311 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.469
 you can meet him quite often 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.360
 especially in the forest area so you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.360
 he was surely already found 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.210
 With the help of this bug, I have repeatedly noticed 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.289
 an enemy that passed by and no 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:09.830
 even managed to kill him so sometimes 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:12.140
 This bug is even useful I do not know about 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.590
 Moreover , this bug is also found on 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.509
 other maps or not but if you know 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.520
 or found when we can 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.630
 unsubscribe in the comments will be very 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:33.229
 thankful 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:36.440
 And on the map of the border will rush after the explosion 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.259
 detonator at point g we can observe 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.860
 the hole above which the texture is located 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.810
 bush 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.810
 which rises above this bright 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.159
 I do not know why the developers could not 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.350
 clean like a bush but in general it is such 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:08.869
 I liked the tank too 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:11.330
 I decided to add it to the hands and to 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.440
 activate the next bug you need 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.140
 be on the map 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.989
 the siege of Shanghai and so that the server 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.239
 a little bit but for the floor if there will be people 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.180
 Little did not notice this bug may not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.690
 triggered by the former approach to any 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.870
 statues with a lion and start over it 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.269
 shoot it with time or immediately 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 will begin to recover here such 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.530
 small bug 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.489
 you certainly sorry that I stop a little 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.040
 tanks but still I chose the most 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.650
 interesting and simplest boon 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.620
 which you yourself could do i 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 I failed under the cards I saw neither 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.019
 drawn textures i broke my torso 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.540
 wood on me hem drawer was killing me and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.120
 all this in battlefield 4 and in general 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.620
