sketches to look for my dogs to look the
way<00:05:52.140> they<00:05:52.229> do<00:05:52.440> you<00:05:53.430> so<00:05:53.640> you<00:05:53.700> go<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:53.970> layer<00:05:54.210> new

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
way they do you so you go to layer new

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.210 
way they do you so you go to layer new
line<00:05:55.020> work<00:05:55.260> layer<00:05:55.440> make<00:05:55.650> sure<00:05:55.800> its<00:05:55.919> new<00:05:56.040> line

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
line work layer make sure its new line

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.690 
line work layer make sure its new line
work<00:05:56.370> layer<00:05:56.990> okay<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.050> we<00:05:58.740> have<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.950> heart<00:05:59.280> and

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
work layer okay so we have a heart and

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.180 
work layer okay so we have a heart and
do<00:06:00.450> we<00:06:00.600> have<00:06:00.750> layer<00:06:01.020> one<00:06:01.290> which<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.979> one<00:06:02.100> we

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
do we have layer one which is the one we

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.790 
do we have layer one which is the one we
do<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.400> on<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.970> line<00:06:03.150> work<00:06:03.300> layer<00:06:03.680> so<00:06:04.680> you're

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
do it on the line work layer so you're

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.950 
do it on the line work layer so you're
going<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:04.950> go<00:06:05.040> back<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.190> layer<00:06:05.690> 102<00:06:06.690> your

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
going to go back to layer 102 your

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.900 
going to go back to layer 102 your
opacity<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.830> you're<00:06:07.979> going<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.130> lower<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.580> to

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
opacity and you're going to lower it to

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.320 
opacity and you're going to lower it to
about<00:06:09.210> fifty<00:06:09.570> percent<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:11.550> linework<00:06:12.030> layer

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
about fifty percent the linework layer

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.909 
about fifty percent the linework layer
is<00:06:12.630> above<00:06:13.350> your<00:06:14.419> sketch<00:06:15.419> layer<00:06:15.830> so<00:06:16.830> you're

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
is above your sketch layer so you're

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.200 
is above your sketch layer so you're
going<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.100> zoom<00:06:17.310> in<00:06:17.550> you're<00:06:17.880> going<00:06:18.000> to<00:06:18.060> go<00:06:18.150> to

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
going to zoom in you're going to go to

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.860 
going to zoom in you're going to go to
your<00:06:18.330> pen<00:06:18.540> tool<00:06:18.979> now<00:06:19.979> this<00:06:20.280> is<00:06:20.870> really

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
your pen tool now this is really

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.430 
your pen tool now this is really
important<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.890> sort<00:06:23.190> says<00:06:23.370> stabilizer<00:06:24.260> go<00:06:25.260> in

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
important you sort says stabilizer go in

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.850 
important you sort says stabilizer go in
and<00:06:25.950> you<00:06:26.100> go<00:06:26.190> all<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.610> way<00:06:26.640> down<00:06:26.850> s7<00:06:27.740> this<00:06:28.740> is

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
and you go all the way down s7 this is

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.070 
and you go all the way down s7 this is
the<00:06:28.979> stabilizer<00:06:29.550> tools<00:06:29.850> so<00:06:30.270> when<00:06:30.660> you<00:06:30.810> draw

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
the stabilizer tools so when you draw

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.050 
the stabilizer tools so when you draw
it'll<00:06:31.530> automatically<00:06:32.070> stabilize<00:06:32.640> your<00:06:32.790> lines

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
it'll automatically stabilize your lines

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.820 
it'll automatically stabilize your lines
so<00:06:33.450> they<00:06:33.479> look<00:06:33.720> very<00:06:33.750> clean<00:06:34.169> and<00:06:34.380> crisp<00:06:34.470> and

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
so they look very clean and crisp and

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.640 
so they look very clean and crisp and
you're<00:06:34.979> not<00:06:35.100> all<00:06:35.160> over<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.520> place<00:06:36.500> s7<00:06:37.500> is<00:06:37.530> the

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
you're not all over the place s7 is the

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.750 
you're not all over the place s7 is the
highest<00:06:37.979> one<00:06:38.160> so<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:38.460> want<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.640> make<00:06:38.669> sure

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
highest one so you want to make sure

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.740 
highest one so you want to make sure
it's<00:06:38.940> on<00:06:38.970> the<00:06:39.090> high<00:06:39.210> swan<00:06:39.510> I

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
it's on the high swan I

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.810 
it's on the high swan I
you<00:06:40.810> should<00:06:40.990> i<00:06:41.020> use<00:06:41.170> black<00:06:41.440> because<00:06:41.950> black<00:06:42.280> is

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
you should i use black because black is

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.360 
you should i use black because black is
cool<00:06:43.230> doesn't<00:06:44.230> matter<00:06:44.320> what<00:06:44.470> size<00:06:44.680> users<00:06:45.070> 2<00:06:45.280> or

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
3 i'm going to go in it draw over it so

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.590 
3 i'm going to go in it draw over it so
where<00:06:54.220> you<00:06:54.340> can<00:06:54.550> really<00:06:54.820> just<00:06:55.120> zoom<00:06:55.360> in<00:06:55.540> and<00:06:55.720> go

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
where you can really just zoom in and go

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:10.710 
where you can really just zoom in and go
we<00:07:02.760> and<00:07:04.920> away<00:07:05.920> we<00:07:05.950> go<00:07:07.770> and<00:07:09.240> where<00:07:10.240> are<00:07:10.330> we<00:07:10.390> we<00:07:10.600> go

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
we and away we go and where are we we go

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.860 
we and away we go and where are we we go
to<00:07:14.490> actually<00:07:15.490> do<00:07:15.669> real<00:07:15.910> line<00:07:16.150> art<00:07:16.360> it<00:07:16.510> can<00:07:16.660> take

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
to actually do real line art it can take

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.340 
to actually do real line art it can take
a<00:07:16.930> while<00:07:17.110> usually<00:07:18.360> when<00:07:19.360> I<00:07:19.390> draw<00:07:19.720> it<00:07:20.080> takes

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
a while usually when I draw it takes

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.240 
a while usually when I draw it takes
anywhere<00:07:20.860> from<00:07:20.919> an<00:07:21.850> hour<00:07:22.330> to<00:07:22.540> eight<00:07:23.169> hours<00:07:23.320> to

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
anywhere from an hour to eight hours to

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.960 
anywhere from an hour to eight hours to
draw<00:07:24.610> a<00:07:24.880> complete<00:07:25.390> dry<00:07:25.590> now<00:07:26.590> very<00:07:27.550> important

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
draw a complete dry now very important
