00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.509 
so what I'm thinking is how about
creating<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:14.049> frame<00:00:14.500> for<00:00:14.889> wall-mounted

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
creating a frame for wall-mounted

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.130 
creating a frame for wall-mounted
television<00:00:16.059> sets<00:00:16.390> so<00:00:16.570> what<00:00:16.689> I<00:00:16.750> need<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:17.020> do

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
television sets so what I need to do

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.499 
television sets so what I need to do
first<00:00:17.349> is<00:00:17.770> take<00:00:18.310> some<00:00:18.550> measurements<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:19.270> find

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
first is take some measurements to find

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.269 
first is take some measurements to find
out<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:19.750> type<00:00:19.930> of<00:00:19.960> dimensions<00:00:20.710> I'm<00:00:20.919> working

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
out what type of dimensions I'm working

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.290 
out what type of dimensions I'm working
with<00:00:21.490> I<00:00:21.730> also<00:00:22.029> want<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:23.220> get<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.340> distance<00:00:24.849> the

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
with I also want to get the distance the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.179 
with I also want to get the distance the
television<00:00:25.810> sits<00:00:26.079> away<00:00:26.500> from<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:26.980> wall

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
television sits away from the wall

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.279 
television sits away from the wall
because<00:00:27.670> our<00:00:28.060> frame<00:00:28.420> is<00:00:28.449> going<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.900> be<00:00:29.019> that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
because our frame is going to be that

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:54.530 
because our frame is going to be that
deep
