00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.019 

so<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> idea<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.400> exercise<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.299> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.980> 13

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:14.029 
so the idea of this exercise is to do 13

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.920 
so the idea of this exercise is to do 13
different<00:00:15.029> scales<00:00:16.039> starting<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.189> one<00:00:17.550> note<00:00:17.930> we

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
different scales starting on one note we

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.679 
different scales starting on one note we
don't<00:00:19.140> go<00:00:19.320> beyond<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> doctor<00:00:20.689> everything

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
don't go beyond the doctor everything

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.370 
don't go beyond the doctor everything
with<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.110> really<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:23.099> goal<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.610> these

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
with it not really so the goal of these

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.310 
with it not really so the goal of these
studies<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.890> I'm<00:00:26.040> about<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> present<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
studies which I'm about to present is to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.979 
studies which I'm about to present is to
develop<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.950> ear<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.700> if<00:00:30.239> your<00:00:30.390> fingers<00:00:30.779> at

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
develop your ear and if your fingers at

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.600 
develop your ear and if your fingers at
the<00:00:31.110> same<00:00:31.140> time<00:00:31.680> so<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> you're

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the same time so that you're

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
the same time so that you're
simultaneously<00:00:33.320> practicing<00:00:34.320> both<00:00:34.559> your

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
simultaneously practicing both your

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.150 
simultaneously practicing both your
training<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> guitar<00:00:35.969> technique<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.950> think<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
training and guitar technique I think a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
training and guitar technique I think a
lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.730> practicing<00:00:39.149> techniques<00:00:39.600> sort

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
lot of people practicing techniques sort

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420 
lot of people practicing techniques sort
of<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> diseases<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.890> drudgery<00:00:41.129> I've

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
of think of diseases of drudgery I've

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.299 
of think of diseases of drudgery I've
got<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> practice<00:00:42.089> technique<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.719> boring<00:00:43.199> but<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
got a practice technique a boring but in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.649 
got a practice technique a boring but in
fact<00:00:44.609> what<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> trying<00:00:45.179> to<00:00:45.269> do<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.480> these

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
fact what I'm trying to do with these

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.389 
fact what I'm trying to do with these
exercises<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.890> sort<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
exercises is just sort of to give a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
exercises is just sort of to give a
basic<00:00:47.670> model<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> invite<00:00:48.989> everybody

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
basic model and then to invite everybody

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
basic model and then to invite everybody
to<00:00:49.859> be<00:00:50.370> creative<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> model<00:00:51.659> so<00:00:52.199> what

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
to be creative with the model so what

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.209 
to be creative with the model so what
I'm<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:53.129> demonstrate<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.879> 13<00:00:54.510> scales

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
I'm about to demonstrate are 13 scales

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
I'm about to demonstrate are 13 scales
starting<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.519> one<00:00:56.789> note<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.929> idea

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
starting on from one note and the idea

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
starting on from one note and the idea
is<00:00:58.289> ultimately<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.190> scales<00:00:59.519> in<00:00:59.850> all

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
is ultimately to do these scales in all

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.680 
is ultimately to do these scales in all
keys<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.800> other<00:01:01.949> idea<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.179> exercise<00:01:03.479> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
keys the other idea of this exercise is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
keys the other idea of this exercise is
to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.170> consecutive<00:01:05.159> strength<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:05.909> I'll

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to use consecutive strength so I'll

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.160 
to use consecutive strength so I'll
trace<00:01:08.960> within<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.140> octave<00:01:11.750> various<00:01:12.750> ways<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
trace within one octave various ways to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
trace within one octave various ways to
divide<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.650> octave<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.670> different

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
divide an octave up into different

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.800 
divide an octave up into different
scales

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
scales

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.370 
scales
so<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.400> goes<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.870> to<00:01:18.930> start<00:01:19.200> off

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so here goes so we're going to start off

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.780 
so here goes so we're going to start off
with<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.650> simplest<00:01:19.980> scale<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.700> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
with the simplest scale of all that we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580 
with the simplest scale of all that we
all<00:01:20.940> know<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> major<00:01:21.600> scale<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.290> called<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
all know the major scale it's called the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
all know the major scale it's called the
major<00:01:22.830> scale<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.550> start<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.060> white<00:01:24.300> keys

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
major scale you start on the white keys

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.290 
major scale you start on the white keys
of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> piano<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.730> step<00:01:27.150> by

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
of the piano and you just go up step by

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.010 
of the piano and you just go up step by
step<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.580> starting<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:29.700> C<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:31.200> scale

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
step you have starting on C this scale

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
step you have starting on C this scale
Cindy<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.500> D<00:01:34.860> 2nd<00:01:37.220> major<00:01:38.220> scale<00:01:38.580> everybody

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
Cindy or D 2nd major scale everybody

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.010 
Cindy or D 2nd major scale everybody
knows<00:01:39.410> now<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.470> also<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:41.840> various<00:01:42.840> other

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
knows now we also have various other

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
knows now we also have various other
possible<00:01:43.650> ways<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:44.070> dividing<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> octave

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
possible ways of dividing out the octave

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.940 
possible ways of dividing out the octave
so<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.660> went

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.880 

now<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.330> go<00:01:53.630> back<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.320> very<00:01:54.560> famous

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
now if we go back to the very famous

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.219 
now if we go back to the very famous
seven<00:01:55.640> church<00:01:55.850> boats<00:01:56.180> starting<00:01:56.810> on<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.020> white

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
seven church boats starting on the white

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.440 
seven church boats starting on the white
piece<00:01:57.470> of<00:01:57.680> town<00:01:57.979> starting<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.790> see<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.360> would

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
piece of town starting to see we would

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.390 
piece of town starting to see we would
have<00:01:59.690> the<00:02:00.110> Ionian<00:02:00.650> that's<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> same<00:02:01.159> as<00:02:01.280> the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
have the Ionian that's the same as the

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.730 
have the Ionian that's the same as the
major<00:02:01.580> scale<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.690> next<00:02:02.960> thing<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.229> next<00:02:03.590> note

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
major scale the next thing on next note

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.550 
major scale the next thing on next note
up<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.190> D<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:04.820> pick<00:02:05.030> Dorian<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.750> next<00:02:06.470> zone

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
up is D so I pick Dorian the next zone

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.680 
up is D so I pick Dorian the next zone
up<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.890> e<00:02:07.070> that's<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.700> frigid<00:02:08.060> scale<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.509> next

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
up is e that's the frigid scale the next

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.749 
up is e that's the frigid scale the next
note<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.110> F<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.979> gives<00:02:10.190> you<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.429> Lydian

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
note up is F that gives you the Lydian

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.449 
note up is F that gives you the Lydian
scale<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.600> next<00:02:11.840> setup<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.590> G<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
scale the next setup is G that is the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.850 
scale the next setup is G that is the
mixolydian<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.330> next<00:02:14.569> note<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.260> because

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
mixolydian the next note up is a because

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.949 
mixolydian the next note up is a because
you<00:02:15.980> alien<00:02:16.550> finally<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.330> get<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> end<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
you alien finally you get to the end of

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.440 
you alien finally you get to the end of
the<00:02:18.050> white<00:02:18.230> keys<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.920> hit<00:02:19.130> B<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.239> go

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the white keys and you hit B and you go

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.000 
the white keys and you hit B and you go
on<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> white<00:02:20.989> key<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> piano<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.860> get

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
on the white key to the piano you get

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.770 
on the white key to the piano you get
low<00:02:22.280> freedom<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.060> those<00:02:23.239> are<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.570> so-called

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
low freedom so those are the so-called

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.320 
low freedom so those are the so-called
seven<00:02:24.410> church<00:02:24.769> modes<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.910> we're<00:02:26.090> going<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
seven church modes so we're going to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330 
seven church modes so we're going to
start<00:02:26.660> with<00:02:26.840> those<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.320> not<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.040> order

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
start with those but not in that order

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.890 
start with those but not in that order
is<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.790> think<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.120> order<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> little

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
is I think that order can be a little

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.290 
is I think that order can be a little
confusing<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.500> hard<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.950> remember<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:32.120> if

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
confusing and hard to remember so if

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.540 
confusing and hard to remember so if
you'll<00:02:32.450> notice<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.440> seven<00:02:33.860> church<00:02:34.220> modes

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
you'll notice of the seven church modes

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.090 
you'll notice of the seven church modes
three<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.209> them<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.600> major<00:02:36.140> third<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
three of them have major third of the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.550 
three of them have major third of the
beginning<00:02:37.690> three<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.750> them<00:02:38.870> started<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.350> way

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
beginning three of them started this way

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.710 
beginning three of them started this way
the<00:02:40.130> three<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.459> starting<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:40.970> way<00:02:41.300> are<00:02:41.570> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
the three that starting this way are the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.600 
the three that starting this way are the
major<00:02:41.900> scale

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.250 

and<00:02:47.030> there's<00:02:47.420> another<00:02:47.600> one<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.810> has<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and there's another one that has the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.150 
and there's another one that has the
major<00:02:48.440> three<00:02:48.830> back<00:02:49.220> right<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:51.710> next<00:02:51.950> one<00:02:52.070> that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
major three back right the next one that

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.470 
major three back right the next one that
has<00:02:52.280> majors<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:52.970> could<00:02:53.120> say<00:02:53.270> would<00:02:53.420> be

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
has majors or we could say would be

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.660 
has majors or we could say would be
deleted<00:02:53.990> which<00:02:54.170> raises<00:02:54.470> also<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.130> four<00:02:55.370> three

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
deleted which raises also the four three

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.440 
deleted which raises also the four three
two<00:02:55.730> one<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.400> fingering<00:03:01.790> us<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.240> left

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
two one so in fingering us with the left

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.720 
two one so in fingering us with the left
hand<00:03:02.690> we<00:03:03.110> could<00:03:03.320> simplify<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.430> left<00:03:04.640> hand

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
hand we could simplify the left hand

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.620 
hand we could simplify the left hand
fingering<00:03:05.270> by<00:03:05.510> imagine<00:03:06.170> two<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.520> then<00:03:08.300> twice

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
fingering by imagine two and then twice

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.570 
fingering by imagine two and then twice
one<00:03:09.020> three<00:03:09.230> four<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:12.680> I'm<00:03:12.860> practicing<00:03:13.430> this

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
one three four so if I'm practicing this

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.690 
one three four so if I'm practicing this
scale<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.170> do<00:03:15.170> not<00:03:15.440> want<00:03:15.710> to<00:03:15.890> complicate<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
scale I do not want to complicate the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.290 
scale I do not want to complicate the
process

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
process

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.180 
process
I<00:03:17.330> want<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.840> process<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.200> be<00:03:18.320> as<00:03:18.650> simple<00:03:19.010> as

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I want the process to be as simple as

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.960 
I want the process to be as simple as
possible<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:19.910> my<00:03:19.970> brain<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.960> I'll<00:03:21.170> think<00:03:21.410> and

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
possible for my brain so I'll think and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
possible for my brain so I'll think and
now<00:03:22.970> I'll<00:03:23.120> think<00:03:23.360> twice<00:03:23.840> 1:34

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.020 

come<00:03:27.590> down<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.490> have<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.120> now<00:03:30.110> twice<00:03:30.470> one<00:03:31.030> two

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
come down so I have to now twice one two

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.360 
come down so I have to now twice one two
three<00:03:32.300> four<00:03:34.540> four<00:03:35.540> two<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:36.980> what<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.310> means

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
three four four two so what this means

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.030 
three four four two so what this means
is<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.760> my<00:03:38.000> brain<00:03:38.300> gets<00:03:38.840> vacation<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:39.800> I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
is that my brain gets vacation because I

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.370 
is that my brain gets vacation because I
just<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.400> too<00:03:40.610> long<00:03:40.880> now<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.480> think<00:03:41.840> one

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
just think too long now I think one

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.650 
just think too long now I think one
three<00:03:42.590> four<00:03:42.740> one<00:03:42.950> three<00:03:43.070> four<00:03:43.480> which<00:03:44.480> you

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
three four one three four which you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.540 
three four one three four which you
could<00:03:44.870> compare<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.650> if<00:03:46.100> you're<00:03:46.340> memorizing

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
could compare to if you're memorizing

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.850 
could compare to if you're memorizing
the<00:03:46.880> phone<00:03:47.150> number<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:48.290> know<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.470> area<00:03:48.830> code

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
the phone number you know the area code

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.040 
the phone number you know the area code
let's<00:03:49.430> say<00:03:49.550> for<00:03:49.760> Boston<00:03:50.270> we<00:03:50.540> have<00:03:50.660> six<00:03:50.900> one

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
let's say for Boston we have six one

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.570 
let's say for Boston we have six one
seven<00:03:51.320> lot<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.620> people<00:03:51.830> at<00:03:51.890> six<00:03:52.160> one<00:03:52.370> seven

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
seven lot of people at six one seven

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.430 
seven lot of people at six one seven
area<00:03:52.940> go<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.660> if<00:03:53.720> somebody<00:03:54.019> tells<00:03:54.200> me<00:03:54.290> their

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
area go so if somebody tells me their

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.690 
area go so if somebody tells me their
phone<00:03:54.680> over<00:03:54.890> here<00:03:55.040> in<00:03:55.100> Boston

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
phone over here in Boston

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.180 
phone over here in Boston
I<00:03:55.730> don't<00:03:56.239> think<00:03:56.300> six<00:03:56.870> one<00:03:57.230> seven<00:03:57.590> because<00:03:57.980> that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
I don't think six one seven because that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.830 
I don't think six one seven because that
slows<00:03:58.400> my<00:03:58.580> brain<00:03:58.850> down<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:03:59.269> Oh<00:03:59.510> Boston

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
slows my brain down I think Oh Boston

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.199 
slows my brain down I think Oh Boston
area<00:04:00.170> code<00:04:00.380> Bank<00:04:00.769> done<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> same<00:04:01.970> thing

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
area code Bank done so the same thing

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.370 
area code Bank done so the same thing
here<00:04:02.360> we<00:04:02.510> think<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:07.580> probably<00:04:07.940> done<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
here we think so so probably done the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.620 
here we think so so probably done the
major<00:04:09.739> scale<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.890> now<00:04:13.130> in<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.150> first<00:04:14.420> new

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
major scale and now in the first new

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.190 
major scale and now in the first new
skill<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.140> did<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.470> took<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.800> Lydian<00:04:16.130> scale

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
skill you did it took the Lydian scale

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.350 
skill you did it took the Lydian scale
raise<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.440> fourth<00:04:18.739> degree

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.420 

now<00:04:24.360> let's<00:04:24.569> take<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.169> other<00:04:25.199> church<00:04:26.129> boat

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
now let's take the other church boat

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.339 
now let's take the other church boat
that<00:04:26.639> has<00:04:26.819> the<00:04:26.969> major<00:04:27.180> third<00:04:27.599> in<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.900> down

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
that has the major third in it down

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.010 
that has the major third in it down
unless<00:04:29.189> let's<00:04:29.669> take<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.999> mixolydian<00:04:30.360> which

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
unless let's take the mixolydian which

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.320 
unless let's take the mixolydian which
is<00:04:31.199> instead<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.770> one<00:04:32.069> two<00:04:32.520> one<00:04:32.759> three<00:04:32.789> fours

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
is instead of one two one three fours

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.140 
is instead of one two one three fours
it's<00:04:33.810> two<00:04:34.139> one<00:04:34.289> two<00:04:34.529> four<00:04:34.560> sorts<00:04:37.999> so<00:04:38.999> that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
it's two one two four sorts so that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.239 
it's two one two four sorts so that
sounds<00:04:39.509> different<00:04:39.930> from<00:04:45.080> now<00:04:46.080> let's<00:04:46.319> shift<00:04:46.740> to

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
sounds different from now let's shift to

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.489 
sounds different from now let's shift to
the<00:04:47.430> church<00:04:47.669> folks<00:04:47.969> that<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.330> minor<00:04:48.659> 30<00:04:49.020> so

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:49.499 
the church folks that have a minor 30 so

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:53.450 
the church folks that have a minor 30 so
in<00:04:50.009> this<00:04:50.129> case<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.990> CVG<00:04:51.990> flat<00:04:52.349> right<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.340> we'll

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
in this case on CVG flat right so we'll

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.950 
in this case on CVG flat right so we'll
take<00:04:53.669> flat<00:04:54.449> now<00:04:56.120> now<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.419> what<00:04:57.719> we<00:04:57.810> call

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
take flat now now this is what we call

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.899 
take flat now now this is what we call
the<00:04:58.080> Aeolian<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.979> natural<00:04:59.490> minor<00:04:59.759> scale

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
the Aeolian or the natural minor scale

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.610 
the Aeolian or the natural minor scale
and<00:05:00.409> it<00:05:01.409> has<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.889> set<00:05:02.129> of<00:05:02.219> intervals<00:05:02.520> yes

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
and it has this set of intervals yes

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.760 
and it has this set of intervals yes
another<00:05:04.620> one<00:05:04.889> three<00:05:05.099> four<00:05:06.349> sort<00:05:07.349> of<00:05:07.439> memorize

another one three four sort of memorize
the<00:05:07.979> fingering<00:05:08.310> for<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.520> just<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:09.449> we're

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the fingering for this just like we're

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.200 
the fingering for this just like we're
memorizing<00:05:10.560> fingering<00:05:11.250> for<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.759> area<00:05:12.029> code

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
memorizing fingering for the area code

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.290 
memorizing fingering for the area code
phone<00:05:12.509> number<00:05:12.810> I'll<00:05:12.990> memorize<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.120> only

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
phone number I'll memorize so I only

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.719 
phone number I'll memorize so I only
think<00:05:18.479> twice<00:05:19.339> there<00:05:20.339> and<00:05:20.669> then<00:05:20.759> I<00:05:20.819> think<00:05:20.849> here

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
think twice there and then I think here

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.149 
think twice there and then I think here
so<00:05:23.729> now<00:05:23.939> we<00:05:23.969> have<00:05:24.330> got<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.810> first<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.409> the

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
so now we have got the first of the

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.600 
so now we have got the first of the
church<00:05:26.430> boats<00:05:26.759> with<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.479> minor<00:05:27.689> thirty<00:05:28.610> now

our favorite one is guitars the Phrygian
mode<00:05:33.839> so<00:05:34.169> we'll<00:05:34.289> flat<00:05:34.589> the<00:05:34.860> second<00:05:35.159> degree

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
mode so we'll flat the second degree

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.899 
mode so we'll flat the second degree
this<00:05:37.439> case<00:05:37.649> would<00:05:37.830> be<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:38.009> D<00:05:38.250> flat

I said a g5 now let's take once again
this<00:05:59.409> is<00:05:59.560> a<00:05:59.620> point<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.889> reference<00:06:00.069> let's

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
this is a point of reference let's

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.059 
this is a point of reference let's
return<00:06:00.699> to<00:06:00.759> our<00:06:01.030> very<00:06:01.689> easy<00:06:01.990> natural<00:06:02.500> line<00:06:05.069> and

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
return to our very easy natural line and

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.950 
return to our very easy natural line and
now<00:06:06.219> let's<00:06:06.430> raise<00:06:06.639> the<00:06:06.939> six<00:06:07.240> which<00:06:07.689> will<00:06:07.840> give

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
now let's raise the six which will give

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.540 
now let's raise the six which will give
us<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.080> Dorian<00:06:08.560> scale<00:06:11.069> something<00:06:12.069> to<00:06:12.280> point

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
us the Dorian scale something to point

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.980 
us the Dorian scale something to point
out<00:06:12.639> that<00:06:12.789> is<00:06:12.909> possible<00:06:15.389> various<00:06:16.389> fingers<00:06:16.750> I

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
out that is possible various fingers I

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.350 
out that is possible various fingers I
like<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:18.449> because<00:06:19.449> hard<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.560> play<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.759> we<00:06:21.879> hear

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
like it because hard to play and we hear

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.990 
like it because hard to play and we hear
and<00:06:22.539> feel<00:06:23.110> in<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:24.159> choreography<00:06:24.430> of<00:06:24.879> the

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
and feel in the choreography of the

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.029 
and feel in the choreography of the
fingers<00:06:25.690> we<00:06:26.080> hear<00:06:26.500> and<00:06:26.830> feel<00:06:28.349> so<00:06:29.349> 60-degree

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
fingers we hear and feel so 60-degree

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.119 
fingers we hear and feel so 60-degree
now<00:06:30.960> let's<00:06:31.960> go<00:06:32.110> back<00:06:32.259> to<00:06:32.409> our<00:06:32.530> natural<00:06:32.680> minor

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129 
now let's go back to our natural minor

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:43.379 
now let's go back to our natural minor
once<00:06:33.430> again<00:06:33.669> just<00:06:33.849> Orient<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:36.210> let's<00:06:37.210> raise

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.900 

now<00:06:44.389> let's<00:06:44.630> do<00:06:44.810> a<00:06:45.110> lot<00:06:45.740> of<00:06:45.860> minor<00:06:46.070> that<00:06:46.310> brings

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
now let's do a lot of minor that brings

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.270 
now let's do a lot of minor that brings
in<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.120> sixth<00:06:47.750> and<00:06:48.200> a<00:06:48.290> seventh<00:06:48.710> and<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.100> goes

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
in the sixth and a seventh and it goes

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.900 
in the sixth and a seventh and it goes
back<00:06:49.490> Manhattan<00:06:49.900> right<00:06:51.040> so<00:06:52.040> now<00:06:52.220> we<00:06:52.280> have<00:06:52.639> done

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
back Manhattan right so now we have done

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.690 
back Manhattan right so now we have done
nine<00:06:53.690> scales<00:06:54.410> already<00:06:54.860> the<00:06:55.130> seven<00:06:55.490> church

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700
