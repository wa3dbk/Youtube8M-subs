00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 the second evolution is the creators of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 the saga of banfield is more than destroy 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.710
 skyscraper or something similar is rather 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.030
 an abstract concept that will change the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.889
 way we play the shooters 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.460
 in the first person stay here to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.460
 do a little more 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.189
 now youtube I'm pizza head and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.080
 Welcome to explain what it is 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.520
 the evolution I hope it's a video 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.320
 short and they can solve all their 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.539
 doubts that you have about it very well 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.669
 started the e3 and during transmissions 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.410
 we had several interviews calmly 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.239
 Clues which is the main producer or 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.220
 the main producers of dais in 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.290
 this case mentioned that evolution does not 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.150
 it's just throwing good skyscrapers 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.879
 it will mean throwing a whole map 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.920
 because not quite you can destroy 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.930
 some things pillars as they saw it in 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 the gameplay or at the official launch 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.979
 of multiplayer but it destroyed a whole 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.589
 map is not because it is not an engine 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.720
 powerful the pass graphics 3 and all 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.390
 others but rather is for a 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.979
 design question what if you guys 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.540
 they block two buildings at the same time 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.580
 they stay suspended to nothing because 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.439
 they are holding on to each other or things 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.840
 similar or can no longer access 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.540
 some area to the flag of a 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 example that's what you did dais destroy 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.080
 only certain things that do not affect 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.150
 the gameplay but nevertheless that they 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.369
 can give some advantage 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.590
 strategic about the opponent then 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.290
 What is evolution because evolution 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.660
 rather it is not only destruction 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.190
 and so we can destroy with c4 the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.020
 pillars and drop a tank for 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.970
 leaving him trapped is an example of the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.410
 evolution or also describes the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 skyscraper with the pillars that are 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.010
 down that is also revolution but 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 It is also the fact that 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 you will be able to use your 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.880
 senses more precisely the ear by 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.290
 example if you are in a place in 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.479
 the one that have to go through a detector 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.250
 of metals the fact that you 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.990
 have to go through the detector 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.790
 metals with a gun is going to sound the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.380
 enemy will be alert about it and 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.700
 they will be able to go to the area more 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.100
 quickly that if you were 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 totally stealthy also something very 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 simple elevators with button the fact 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.740
 that there is an elevator makes you 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.270
 You can modify your environment and upload more 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.979
 quickly a building that take a 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.170
 helicopter or maybe the stairs 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.970
 although we did not see them and that means that 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.040
 it will sound a ping when they reach the top 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.870
 that's going to make the players that 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.850
 are at the top go find the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.250
 elevator that opens and kill them all 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.170
 there are also ways in which 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.730
 can modify the map without destroying it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.709
 for example on the bridges we saw the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 multiplayer have certain fences 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.820
 electronic is what serves a 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.800
 side can pass the other side no longer 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.190
 you can if you pass and you want charles 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.900
 in reverse 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.360
 they can no longer do it or on the contrary 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.130
 they can leave enemies rather to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.020
 enemies on the other side vehicles without 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.880
 they can not destroy it with a 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.950
 tank can not get on top of them 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.810
 has to get down to someone open the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.340
 Gate those little pillars 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.380
 only allow the passage aside the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.600
 another when they are activated if a team 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
 can take care of that area permanently 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 during a game it is most likely 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.070
 that the opposing team can not pass 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 with enough vehicles 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.000
 heavy that could give them the advantage 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.490
 to capture another point we could also 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.800
 see that the flag is at the top of the 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.020
 scratch it to the ceiling what happens 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.810
 there is not that it stays and the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.220
 building already that those foundations are 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.540
 they return the base where the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.550
 new flag of cee 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 also affects visibility 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.720
 Visibility can see dust particles 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.700
 everywhere that they affect more than anything 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.460
 to the aerial vehicles was also 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.620
 mentioned that naval combat more than 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.230
 nothing the waves are going to be transmitted by the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.490
 same network information is to say yes 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.770
 you see a three meter wave 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.180
 approaching you the whole world 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.980
 will see everyone is going to have the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.989
 same advantage or the same disadvantage 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.000
 according to how you play from this 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.770
 way sometimes it's going to be easier 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
 sometimes it's going to be easier 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.010
 sneak off to put that 4 a pot 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.570
 or something similar 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.520
 this way everyone has the same 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.010
 marine experience as a conclusion is 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.140
 as if evolution were something similar 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.240
 what would be bad feel bad company 2 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.950
 with the skills and some small 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.020
 details that give you an advantage in the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.490
 game that's the evolution I hope your 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.900
 doubt has been resolved all those who 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.860
 they asked me about the messages 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.580
 personal and also good that maybe 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.890
 Unfortunately, it's not going to be a 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.630
 total destruction of all total 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.670
 everything but good is going to be a 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.140
 pretty good modification to the mode 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.239
 game is what he liked the video or 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.770
 especially that it has been useful if it was 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.900
 so leave a thumb rating up 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.669
 subscribe if you have not done consider 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.019
 the other videos see some videos 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.310
 who have seen the networks at the end 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.959
 social facebook twitter is in the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.959
 description and see you in the next 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.170
