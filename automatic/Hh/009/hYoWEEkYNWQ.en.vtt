00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
and I we're trying to figure out what

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.090 
and I we're trying to figure out what
was<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.360> best<00:06:16.510> way<00:06:16.630> to<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:17.410> put<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.710> out<00:06:17.830> there

was the best way to to put it out there
it<00:06:18.850> took<00:06:19.030> maybe<00:06:19.240> ten<00:06:19.930> fifteen<00:06:20.350> minutes<00:06:20.380> I

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
it took maybe ten fifteen minutes I

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.410 
it took maybe ten fifteen minutes I

against<00:06:22.660> the<00:06:22.840> minutes<00:06:23.140> days<00:06:23.380> I<00:06:23.880> didn't<00:06:24.880> I

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
against the minutes days I didn't I

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.400 
against the minutes days I didn't I
didn't<00:06:25.180> know<00:06:25.300> but<00:06:25.480> I<00:06:25.540> went<00:06:25.780> was<00:06:25.900> second<00:06:26.260> so<00:06:26.320> I
