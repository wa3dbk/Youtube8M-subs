let's<00:02:01.009> say<00:02:01.160> top<00:02:01.369> three<00:02:03.220> not<00:02:04.220> really<00:02:04.580> because<00:02:04.700> I

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
let's say top three not really because I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.240 
let's say top three not really because I
think<00:02:05.239> of<00:02:05.569> bracket<00:02:05.989> is<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:06.500> unlucky<00:02:06.920> for

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
think of bracket is really unlucky for

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.339 
think of bracket is really unlucky for
us<00:02:07.399> because<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.880> have<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.539> play<00:02:08.750> minuscule

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
us because we have to play minuscule

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.580 
us because we have to play minuscule
tightening<00:02:09.890> around<00:02:10.009> two<00:02:10.280> or<00:02:10.369> three<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:12.020> we<00:02:12.319> had

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
tightening around two or three if we had
