see and I think it's the same as ring
king<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.010> don't<00:00:20.190> know<00:00:20.280> how<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> works<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:22.130> okay

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.420

you can play player versus player or
player<00:00:29.670> vs.<00:00:29.940> computer<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.960> course<00:00:31.200> we're

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
player vs. computer and of course we're

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.690 
player vs. computer and of course we're
just<00:00:31.380> gonna<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:31.830> player<00:00:32.040> versus<00:00:32.460> Peter

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

now<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.360> has<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:33.690> RPG<00:00:34.020> element<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.609> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
now it has an RPG element here so you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.939 
now it has an RPG element here so you
basically<00:00:36.359> you<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.410> through<00:00:37.589> the<00:00:37.710> rings

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
basically you go through the rings

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.950 
basically you go through the rings
fighting<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:38.940> various<00:00:39.269> boxers<00:00:39.749> I<00:00:39.839> guess

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
fighting these various boxers I guess

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
fighting these various boxers I guess
there's<00:00:40.140> 15<00:00:40.499> of<00:00:40.530> them<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.280> we'll<00:00:41.489> start<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.999> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
there's 15 of them so we'll start at the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.689 
there's 15 of them so we'll start at the
lowest<00:00:42.570> rank<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.620> there's<00:00:43.800> RPG<00:00:44.370> element

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
lowest rank then there's RPG element

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.540 
lowest rank then there's RPG element
here<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.809> punch<00:00:46.050> speed<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.679> stamina<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
here we have punch speed and stamina and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.569 
here we have punch speed and stamina and
I'm<00:00:47.670> gonna<00:00:47.839> point<00:00:48.839> suspend<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> guess<00:00:50.399> I'm

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I'm gonna point suspend so I guess I'm

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.380 
I'm gonna point suspend so I guess I'm
gonna<00:00:51.649> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> spend<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.460> equally<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:53.999> guess

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
gonna kind of spend them equally I guess

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.989 
gonna kind of spend them equally I guess
and<00:00:54.749> do<00:00:54.870> five<00:00:55.170> across<00:00:55.440> each<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.850> then

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
and do five across each one and then

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.450 
and do five across each one and then
we're<00:00:57.149> gonna<00:00:57.239> stun<00:00:57.569> and<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.409> controls<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:59.100> B
