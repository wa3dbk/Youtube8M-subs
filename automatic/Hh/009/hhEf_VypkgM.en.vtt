to use this on your g1 and etc basically
you<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.130> take<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> position<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you you take on the position of the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
you you take on the position of the
machine<00:00:27.570> gun<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.400> you've<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> defend

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
machine gun and you've got to defend

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
machine gun and you've got to defend
your<00:00:30.630> base<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> bunch<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.619> waves<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
your base from a bunch of waves of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
your base from a bunch of waves of
invaders<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
invaders so here we go it's a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.000 
invaders so here we go it's a
first-person<00:00:35.040> shooter<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.820> 3d<00:00:36.620> so<00:00:37.620> let's<00:00:37.860> get

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
first-person shooter in 3d so let's get

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.619 
first-person shooter in 3d so let's get
to<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> controls<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.820> done<00:00:45.090> by<00:00:45.390> using

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to it the controls can be done by using

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.080 
to it the controls can be done by using
accelerometer<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> tilt<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
accelerometer and tilt or you can do it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
accelerometer and tilt or you can do it
by<00:00:48.149> touchscreen<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.899> prefer<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> touchscreen

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
by touchscreen I prefer a touchscreen

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.260 
by touchscreen I prefer a touchscreen
because<00:00:50.010> I'm<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
because I'm not very good with the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
because I'm not very good with the
accelerometer<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.930> sensitivity<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
accelerometer or sensitivity there is a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
accelerometer or sensitivity there is a
way<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> change<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> sensitivity<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
way to change the sensitivity but I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
way to change the sensitivity but I
still<00:00:55.680> suck<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.610> prefer<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
still suck at it so I prefer the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.869 
still suck at it so I prefer the
touchscreen<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.160> both<00:01:02.190> guns<00:01:02.699> at

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
touchscreen and you can use both guns at

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.320 
touchscreen and you can use both guns at
once<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.820> gun<00:01:06.030> needed

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
once but as you see my right gun needed

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
once but as you see my right gun needed
to<00:01:06.420> reload<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.860> keep<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.189> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to reload right there so keep that in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030 
to reload right there so keep that in
mind<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.290> banner<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.590> above

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
mind there's a little banner that above

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
mind there's a little banner that above
your<00:01:11.250> bullets<00:01:11.610> saying<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.119> many<00:01:12.180> shots<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
your bullets saying how many shots you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.969 
your bullets saying how many shots you
have<00:01:12.750> left<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:15.570> auto<00:01:15.810> reloads<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
have left it auto reloads for you so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.140 
have left it auto reloads for you so
just<00:01:17.009> keep<00:01:17.880> shooting<00:01:18.090> until<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
just keep shooting until you're out and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.249 
just keep shooting until you're out and
try<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.390> down<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.780> many<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.170> these

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
try to get down as many of these

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.670 
try to get down as many of these
invaders<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:24.049> as<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
invaders as you can as you see the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.280 
invaders as you can as you see the
little<00:01:26.000> radar<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> middle<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> screen

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
little radar in the middle of the screen

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.789 
little radar in the middle of the screen
tells<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.100> where<00:01:29.579> they're<00:01:29.729> coming<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.799> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
tells you where they're coming from so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
tells you where they're coming from so
you<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.250> react<00:01:32.759> quickly<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.960> then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you got to react quickly to down then

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.990 
you got to react quickly to down then
you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> radar<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.759> where

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you can look at the radar to see where

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
you can look at the radar to see where
the<00:01:36.119> next<00:01:36.240> wave<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> coming<00:01:36.960> from<00:01:37.079> they're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the next wave is coming from they're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.960 
the next wave is coming from they're
typically<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> same<00:01:38.939> direction

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.120 

okay<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.510> this<00:01:45.720> particular<00:01:46.020> level<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:46.980> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
okay on this particular level I need to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
okay on this particular level I need to
kill<00:01:47.670> eighty<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.630> there's<00:01:48.810> more

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
kill eighty and I see there's more

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.190 
kill eighty and I see there's more
coming<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:50.550> I've<00:01:51.060> got<00:01:51.210> seven<00:01:51.600> left<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
coming in so I've got seven left and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.900 
coming in so I've got seven left and
then<00:01:52.320> aim<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.740> much<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> them<00:01:53.190> as<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.640> before

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
then aim as much of them as I can before

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.510 
then aim as much of them as I can before
they<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.270> close<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.540> me<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.810> damage<00:01:55.470> my

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
they get close to me and damage my

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.000 
they get close to me and damage my
defenses<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.720> right<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.200> achieved

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
defenses and right there I just achieved

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.710 
defenses and right there I just achieved
my<00:01:59.130> 80<00:02:00.590> ok<00:02:01.590> battery's<00:02:02.070> low<00:02:02.280> whatever<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:03.330> it

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
my 80 ok battery's low whatever and it

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.370 
my 80 ok battery's low whatever and it
tells<00:02:03.870> me<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.560> 80<00:02:04.740> kills<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.960> point<00:02:06.960> 45

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
tells me that I got 80 kills a point 45

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.130 
tells me that I got 80 kills a point 45
points<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:07.980> rank<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.610> an<00:02:08.729> A<00:02:08.880> on<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.300> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
points in my rank was an A on there so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.800

when I'm in my armory I can click on and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.430 
when I'm in my armory I can click on and
a<00:02:20.940> bullet<00:02:22.250> press<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.490> upgrade<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.440> right

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
a bullet press it to upgrade and right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.780 
a bullet press it to upgrade and right
now<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> don't<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.890> enough<00:02:26.130> points<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
now I don't have enough points but if I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
now I don't have enough points but if I
had<00:02:26.940> enough<00:02:27.180> points<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:28.110> increase<00:02:28.590> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
through the tilt which is like this

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.010 
through the tilt which is like this
where<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.790> move<00:03:23.970> directions<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.750> but

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
where you move directions like that but

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.840 
where you move directions like that but
I'm<00:03:25.800> not<00:03:25.950> very<00:03:26.010> good<00:03:26.340> at<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.580> there's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
I'm not very good at that there's

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.300 
I'm not very good at that there's
sensitivity<00:03:27.480> at<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> bottom<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.800> can<00:03:28.980> change

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
sensitivity at the bottom you can change

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.220 
sensitivity at the bottom you can change
it<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.550> do<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.269> touchscreen<00:03:30.750> which<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.080> what<00:03:31.200> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
it to do the touchscreen which is what I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.160 
it to do the touchscreen which is what I
was<00:03:31.440> using<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.070> demo<00:03:32.459> or<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.750> turn

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
was using in that demo or you can turn

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.800 
was using in that demo or you can turn
vibration<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:34.920> sound<00:03:35.100> off<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.570> that's

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
vibration and sound off so that's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.080 
vibration and sound off so that's
basically<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.519> I'm<00:03:38.519> gonna<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.910> another

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
basically it I'm gonna do another

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.060 
basically it I'm gonna do another
campaign<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.380> show<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.620> guys<00:03:40.709> a
