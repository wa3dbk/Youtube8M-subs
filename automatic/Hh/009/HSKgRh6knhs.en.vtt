00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello everyone today I come with a figure 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.540
 for the collection of winning edition 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 exclusive as you see I have needed more 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 normal space for for video and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.850
 now I'll cut it out of the box and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.730
 then I go back to the connection because to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 do this I need more than two hands 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.770
 because as you can see, I wear the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.920
 ice 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.890
 and I do not think so 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.760
 then I'm going to open it and now I'm still 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.679
 the video 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.260
 I already took it out of the box it cost me 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.329
 rather we have to ask for help because 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.379
 they are 14 kilos according to the box is what 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.870
 weigh this and here you have already seen the 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.780
 zelda logo on the drawn cork 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.420
 and here and here goes the card that has 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 removed with the winning code and the brand 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 of the company that makes them go to 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.809
 there the cut has already done to avoid 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.539
 lose time in the opening what happens 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.539
 is that it 's a little bit we're going to see 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.119
 goodbye 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.150
 my mother is worth 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.150
 let's go out first let's do a 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 little hole to the side because this 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.360
 it weighs a lot 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.360
 and we go first with the base 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 numbering 1 2 3 official nintendo 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.960
 it has a degree around here quite a bit 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 and that's nice 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.770
 you see it 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.659
 this weighs pretty green it does not get 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.539
 I'll leave it in front of the front 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.920
 for now and we'll see later was the 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.920
 own the lamp for here 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.200
 now when I go 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.570
 I have you here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.780
 this is the layer that we will do with it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.560
 for them to do this 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.740
 It scares me and where the last photo 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.740
 when not to forget 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.730
 let's throw a little 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.380
 let's look 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.410
 ok I think I've put it inside out 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.600
 a moment that my mother how this happens 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.610
 to turn it around 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.550
 I'm already back there's been a break in 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.069
 the video because I've seen a piece 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.819
 loose is as you see here 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.769
 focuses a little more to it beyond 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.209
 came loose in the box and stopped him because 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.150
 I say to see if the broken one is going to be 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.030
 is looking and that is the Chinese that had 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.099
 that have been responsible for pasting the mel 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.379
 left loose by the box and I have to 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.379
 do the fix anyway I've 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.450
 written to those of efe by efe as the 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.000
 I call myself and they have told me that they make me a 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.569
 discount of 30 euros for the crash of 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.950
 Chinese but nothing is silly and it's the 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.120
 piece of union that had not been put 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 the glue 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.209
 let's finish putting what is the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.209
 stage 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.830
 the birds 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.270
 there you see it this is not that it shines 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.270
 let's put it on 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.990
 let's leave the assembled before seeing the 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.990
 figure completely 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.580
 let's ride it with the head of his 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.540
 exclusive of this edition although also 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.540
 I'm going to show you the other one 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.780
 here is a head here 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.600
 this is the exclusive of the edition 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.910
 to see if I have defined 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.230
 yes yes now 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.230
 of open water 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.630
 We will put it on that this one already had 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.540
 mounted figure 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.130
 i 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.130
 there we have high and screaming 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.870
 now or if you want to turn around and 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.670
 you see from behind while I pull this out 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.670
 it's a fast pass with the image 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.419
 and here I have the other 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.370
 that this is the one that comes in the edition 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.090
 normal let's bring the one a little bit 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.090
 of the light 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:58.259
 here is already serious 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.259
 it's the same but with the mouth closed 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.980
 I do not know which one I'll leave 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.060
 the subtraction is me or not, although this is not 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.450
 pound from both eyes 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.120
 I'm going to flip the figure to 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.580
 that you see it from all angles 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.580
 slowly that this prey is his 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.440
 by days 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.200
 I'm not like that 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.879
 and the last one that remains 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.099
 and then if we see here what it is that 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.090
 I just realized you see if ye seek 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:14.830
 here 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.930
 you see like a green stripe 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.530
 as if making the effect of the shadow 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.530
 of the sword 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:26.379
 and if you put it in front is the effect that 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.379
 I should give 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.080
 there are his little feet 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.500
 the exclusive figure of winning 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.500
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.340
 the uncle says goodbye to the 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.340
 view
