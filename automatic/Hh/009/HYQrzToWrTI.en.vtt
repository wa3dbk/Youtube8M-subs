00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.030
 that I'm not from YouTube, I'm from the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.170
 e3 good this time I come bringing 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:17.760
 a rom 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 Well this reason is called 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.980
 good new tango whether the name but 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.829
 well this rum is fast but for another 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.480
 in the installation but to its sale not 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.630
 I have a lot of time and it did not come 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.680
 bringing the review that good you already 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 They know how to install it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 to install them in a different way 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 so I'm going to leave you a video of how 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.670
 install this 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.670
 so good let's get applications 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.530
 settings 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.160
 on the phone 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.510
 A number of models seems to be 719 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.180
 station we present a mega 17 30 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.390
 and Android 4.3 version 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.840
 like what can be the minis 4.2.2 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.840
 Peru 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.520
 and it seems that the animation of four 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.520
 points 0.4 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.990
 and good of claudia investment a pity the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 they took out 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.430
 and as I say good this is so 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 different and very fast truth 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.200
 well I have not found in him 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 the bar as they see good is like this 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.710
 with this option 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.100
 as a team, the mind shines 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.810
 but the burgos 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.260
 do not 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.229
 the applications that have been installed 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.229
 those that do not have installed is up 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570
 well 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.080
 and keys those are the ones that are not 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.600
 installed because good output is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.870
 install 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.820
 usually the other factories the music 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 well we have music so we do not have 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.870
 trouble or other 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.330
 in war perfectly also the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.100
 music that we want 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.150
 and well there was not anything 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.150
 the camera 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.500
 It was perfectly details at night and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.590
 well this is not seen and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.590
 but the truth 3g wi-fi 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.790
 good storage as always 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.810
 show you hold the cd 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.810
 you are calculating 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.870
 as you see here says card stands out the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.870
 grab there is not one of them 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.079
 is to leave the video and how to install and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.079
 the rome 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 the good sound the tones who does not have 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 nothing of programs has one that would be 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.840
 in bloom as for example this is the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.840
 only one that has 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.610
 good notification is facebook output 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.940
 but they are the only bad 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.690
 the block is also 4.4 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 what else 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.450
 among many animations as good 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.230
 for example when we are here and with the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.230
 animation this 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:15.420
 you must drop the gallery from the calendar 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.420
 thus 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.640
 and the browser 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.930
 is not accessing this 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:43.150
 how do they see this 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.150
 and obviously widgets 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.820
 he also knows how to propose 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:57.480
 I think yes several widgets can be 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:05:01.800
 work the phone be white very well 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.870
 of ice the alarms that I almost think that 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.870
 here nothing extra is done in this type 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.199
 solid explorer trail in the explorer 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.199
 that only 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.330
 and good explorer 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.039
 well cool because good 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.039
 and everything is organized 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.740
 and another thing 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.449
 serious networks basically everything 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.560
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.560
 rom how I loved it 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.900
 when they know that they have filed nothing more 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.070
 they have 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.500
 what is this d 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.950
 when I show in the good chub 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.950
 your 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.010
 all right 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.010
 I do not like 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.710
 and good 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:14.849
 the traitor that is this 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:17.039
 and well I hope you like this rom and 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.529
