how it gets so let's take a little

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.629 
how it gets so let's take a little
journey<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> find<00:00:11.400> out<00:00:12.019> first<00:00:13.040> it<00:00:14.040> falls<00:00:14.400> from

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
journey and find out first it falls from

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.220 
journey and find out first it falls from
the<00:00:14.730> sky<00:00:15.859> and<00:00:17.119> lands<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.930> side<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the sky and lands right on the side of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.849 
the sky and lands right on the side of
our<00:00:19.500> mountains<00:00:20.630> from<00:00:21.630> there<00:00:21.960> some<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
our mountains from there some of it

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.429 
our mountains from there some of it
flows<00:00:23.160> into<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.699> soil<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.960> trickles

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
flows into the soil and some trickles

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
flows into the soil and some trickles
down<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> basin<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.460> eventually<00:00:27.000> join

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
down the basin to eventually join

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390 
down the basin to eventually join
millions<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.529> raindrops<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
millions of other little raindrops and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.530 
millions of other little raindrops and
form<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> stream<00:00:31.700> these<00:00:32.700> streams<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.300> quite

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
form a stream these streams are quite

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.430 
form a stream these streams are quite
low<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> summertime<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.660> raging

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
in the winter time and eventually they

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
in the winter time and eventually they
flow<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:39.899> Comox<00:00:40.590> Lake<00:00:42.649> our<00:00:43.649> fresh

gets sucked right in the you take and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280 
gets sucked right in the you take and
brand<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> pipeline<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.990> now

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
brand into the pipeline it's now

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.400

once<00:01:24.410> I'll<00:01:24.680> drop<00:01:24.980> a<00:01:25.040> rise<00:01:25.370> at<00:01:25.610> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
once I'll drop a rise at the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700 
once I'll drop a rise at the
chlorination<00:01:26.180> station<00:01:26.870> you<00:01:27.320> can<00:01:27.470> have<00:01:27.650> a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
we have five of these massive rezzie's

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500 
we have five of these massive rezzie's
in<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.800> Carmel<00:01:40.130> Valley<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.970> he<00:01:41.120> can<00:01:41.300> take<00:01:41.480> a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
little play just not for too long

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.840 
little play just not for too long
especially<00:01:44.480> during<00:01:45.320> summer<00:01:45.650> month<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:46.730> we

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
especially during summer month when we

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.480 
especially during summer month when we
use<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.240> most<00:01:47.390> water<00:01:47.720> on<00:01:48.140> our<00:01:48.200> lawn

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.610 
use the most water on our lawn
then<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:50.360> right<00:01:50.630> back<00:01:50.900> into<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.380> pipes

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
then it's right back into the pipes

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.950 
then it's right back into the pipes
again<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:53.270> tada

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
again and tada

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.710 
again and tada
it<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.800> this<00:01:54.979> long<00:01:55.280> arduous<00:01:55.610> journey<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.420> little

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it is this long arduous journey a little

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.980 
it is this long arduous journey a little
droplet<00:01:57.380> finally<00:01:57.890> reach<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.550> destination

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
droplet finally reach this destination

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.750 
droplet finally reach this destination
it<00:01:59.990> really<00:02:00.470> makes<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.950> think<00:02:01.010> about<00:02:01.370> how

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
it really makes you think about how

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.210 
it really makes you think about how
difficult<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.660> expensive<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.530> be<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.920> get

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
difficult and expensive it can be to get

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.609 
difficult and expensive it can be to get
fresh<00:02:04.610> water<00:02:04.760> which<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.840> why<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:06.380> should<00:02:06.590> use

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
fresh water which is why we should use

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.310 
fresh water which is why we should use
it<00:02:06.979> efficiently<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:08.000> I've<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:09.020> some<00:02:09.170> bad
