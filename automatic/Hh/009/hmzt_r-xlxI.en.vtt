transforming transformers and even after

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.110 
transforming transformers and even after
we<00:00:19.210> knew<00:00:19.660> that<00:00:20.020> somehow<00:00:20.949> world's<00:00:21.790> smallest

how<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:27.970> confusion<00:00:28.720> started<00:00:29.110> in<00:00:29.260> the<00:00:29.350> first

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
how the confusion started in the first

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.910 
how the confusion started in the first
place<00:00:29.740> I<00:00:30.250> mean<00:00:31.110> maybe<00:00:32.110> if<00:00:32.289> we<00:00:32.439> had<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> better

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
place I mean maybe if we had a better

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.150 
place I mean maybe if we had a better
communications<00:00:33.820> officer<00:00:34.329> we<00:00:35.260> might<00:00:35.620> not<00:00:35.890> get

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
communications officer we might not get

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.599 
communications officer we might not get
that<00:00:36.340> wrong<00:00:37.319> Soundwave<00:00:38.319> had<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:39.069> be<00:00:39.190> in<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.399> line

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
that wrong Soundwave had to be in a line

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.450 
that wrong Soundwave had to be in a line
like<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.179> it's<00:00:40.480> too<00:00:40.929> perfect<00:00:41.440> not<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.190> try

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
like this it's too perfect not to try

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.040 
like this it's too perfect not to try
and<00:00:42.760> Wow

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
and Wow

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.770 
and Wow
did<00:00:44.229> they<00:00:44.440> try<00:00:45.210> naturally<00:00:46.210> he<00:00:46.390> gets<00:00:46.600> his

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
did they try naturally he gets his

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.689 
did they try naturally he gets his
signature<00:00:47.229> tape<00:00:47.530> recorder<00:00:48.010> mode<00:00:48.219> which

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
signature tape recorder mode which

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.209 
signature tape recorder mode which
honestly<00:00:49.300> doesn't<00:00:49.809> have<00:00:50.229> much<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.800> look<00:00:50.979> at

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
honestly doesn't have much to look at

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.610 
honestly doesn't have much to look at
it's<00:00:51.969> well<00:00:52.300> done<00:00:52.600> though<00:00:52.899> some<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.530> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
it's well done though some of the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.619 
it's well done though some of the
transformation<00:00:54.309> has<00:00:54.460> been<00:00:54.579> simplified<00:00:55.089> but

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
transformation has been simplified but

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.369 
transformation has been simplified but
none<00:00:55.929> of<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.260> noticeable<00:00:57.479> well<00:00:58.479> other<00:00:58.989> than

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
none of it is noticeable well other than

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.229 
none of it is noticeable well other than
his<00:00:59.530> face<00:00:59.979> staring<00:01:00.609> up<00:01:00.760> at<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.909> ceiling

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
his face staring up at the ceiling

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.829 
his face staring up at the ceiling
that's<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.260> bit<00:01:02.440> odd<00:01:02.999> also<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.150> size<00:01:04.360> presents

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
that's a bit odd also the size presents

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.930 
that's a bit odd also the size presents
a<00:01:04.930> lot<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.409> fun<00:01:05.740> possibilities<00:01:06.580> with<00:01:06.790> your

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
a lot of fun possibilities with your

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.050 
a lot of fun possibilities with your
larger<00:01:07.360> toys<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.890> bit<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.310> show<00:01:09.549> here<00:01:09.850> though

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
larger toys one bit to show here though

larger toys one bit to show here though
is<00:01:10.329> on<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.750> back<00:01:11.189> recall<00:01:12.189> how<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.490> original

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
is on the back recall how the original

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.819 
is on the back recall how the original
Soundwave<00:01:13.570> stored<00:01:13.990> his<00:01:14.200> weapons<00:01:14.649> like

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
Soundwave stored his weapons like

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.420 
Soundwave stored his weapons like
batteries<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.810> does<00:01:17.259> it<00:01:17.530> too

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
batteries this one does it too

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.539 
batteries this one does it too
it's<00:01:19.229> totally<00:01:20.229> unnecessary<00:01:20.409> it's<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
it's totally unnecessary it's the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.149 
it's totally unnecessary it's the
tiniest<00:01:22.180> trick<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:23.380> awesome<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.130> see

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
tiniest trick but it's awesome to see

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.090 
tiniest trick but it's awesome to see
they<00:01:24.490> worked<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:24.969> in<00:01:25.229> he's<00:01:26.229> got<00:01:26.500> one<00:01:26.829> more

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
they worked it in he's got one more

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.670 
they worked it in he's got one more
trick<00:01:27.490> but<00:01:27.820> let's<00:01:28.149> try<00:01:28.509> transforming<00:01:29.500> him

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
trick but let's try transforming him

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
trick but let's try transforming him
first<00:01:30.009> which<00:01:30.430> again<00:01:30.789> is<00:01:31.030> accurate<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.840> his

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
first which again is accurate to his

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.289 
first which again is accurate to his
original<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:33.280> fist<00:01:33.549> don't<00:01:33.729> have<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.030> slide

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
original the fist don't have to slide

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.260 
original the fist don't have to slide
out<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.810> naturally<00:01:35.560> no<00:01:35.799> neck<00:01:36.130> rotation<00:01:36.700> but

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
out and naturally no neck rotation but

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.419 
out and naturally no neck rotation but
thanks<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.929> miracle<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.409> ball<00:01:38.619> joints<00:01:39.039> it

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
thanks to the miracle of ball joints it

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.510 
thanks to the miracle of ball joints it
works<00:01:39.759> well<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.530> robot<00:01:41.530> mode<00:01:41.560> Soundwave<00:01:42.280> is

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520

articulation shoulders and hips our ball
jointed<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.729> shape<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.509> they<00:02:10.660> really<00:02:11.110> only

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
jointed but shape so they really only
