00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it so instead what I decided to do is I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
it so instead what I decided to do is I
still<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> try<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> live<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.750> so

still want to try out the live thing so
um<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.299> wanted<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.409> as

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
um and because i wanted to do them as

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.230 
um and because i wanted to do them as
soon<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:28.920> possible<00:01:29.430> i<00:01:29.490> wanted<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.060> them

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
soon as possible i wanted to do them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
soon as possible i wanted to do them
that<00:01:30.270> night<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.960> recorded<00:01:31.470> streams<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that night the recorded streams just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
that night the recorded streams just
re-watch<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.240> though<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.390> were<00:01:33.540> alive

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
re-watch them as though they were alive

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
re-watch them as though they were alive
and<00:01:34.939> I<00:01:36.079> but<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.829> Sony<00:01:38.100> starts<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.640> six<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and I but because Sony starts at six it

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.550 
and I but because Sony starts at six it
means<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.600> could<00:01:39.750> only<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.110> live<00:01:40.320> at

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
means that we could only go live at

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039 
means that we could only go live at
about<00:01:40.770> eight<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.810> bit

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
about eight which is just a little bit

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.560 
about eight which is just a little bit
too<00:01:43.259> late<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.829> instead<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.820> figured<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.420> would

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
too late so instead I figured we would

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.840 
too late so instead I figured we would
go<00:01:45.780> live<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.290> Sony<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:46.770> live<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.729> would

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
