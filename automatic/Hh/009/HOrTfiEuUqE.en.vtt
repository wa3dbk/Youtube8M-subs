00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.880 

for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> next<00:00:55.350> six<00:00:55.860> hundred<00:00:56.520> miles<00:00:57.890> I'm

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
for the next six hundred miles I'm

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.500 
for the next six hundred miles I'm
taking<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> Express<00:00:59.789> place<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.329> now

taking the Express place right now
and<00:01:02.810> I<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:05.570> like<00:01:05.810> taking<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.350> expressways

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
and I just like taking the expressways

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.609 
and I just like taking the expressways
because<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:11.240> know<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.690> traffic's<00:01:12.409> much

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
because this you know the traffic's much

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.530 
because this you know the traffic's much
faster<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:15.820> feel<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:16.940> you're<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:17.360> getting

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
faster and feel like you're just getting

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.920

run<00:01:17.840> off<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.170> road<00:01:18.320> all<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.530> time<00:01:18.850> because<00:01:19.930> my

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
run off the road all the time because my

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.450

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
then I didn't want to talk about

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.630 
then I didn't want to talk about
security<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.810> my<00:02:15.020> trip<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.770> there's<00:02:16.460> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
security on my trip and there's the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.809 
security on my trip and there's the
quite<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> few<00:02:17.150> comments<00:02:17.810> on<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.190> subject

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.449 

and<00:02:23.260> there<00:02:24.260> seems<00:02:24.469> to<00:02:24.560> be<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.709> lot<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.890> people<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
and there seems to be a lot of people I

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.259 
and there seems to be a lot of people I
think<00:02:25.879> I<00:02:25.969> should<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.269> taking<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.959> stun<00:02:27.469> gun<00:02:27.769> or<00:02:28.269> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
think I should be taking a stun gun or a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.670 
think I should be taking a stun gun or a
gun<00:02:29.299> itself<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:31.790> least<00:02:31.939> a<00:02:32.120> big<00:02:32.299> night<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:33.200> do

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
gun itself at least a big night I do

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.449 
gun itself at least a big night I do
have<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> knife<00:02:34.189> or<00:02:34.219> utility<00:02:34.629> reasons<00:02:35.629> and<00:02:36.459> I

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
have a knife or utility reasons and I

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.710 
have a knife or utility reasons and I
suppose<00:02:37.969> for<00:02:38.209> protection<00:02:38.719> as<00:02:38.840> well

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
suppose for protection as well

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.450 
suppose for protection as well
but<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.430> idea<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.880> taking<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.390> gun<00:02:43.660> with<00:02:43.930> you

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
but the idea of taking a gun with you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.240 
but the idea of taking a gun with you
so<00:02:45.460> Latin<00:02:45.820> America<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.550> bad<00:02:48.940> idea

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
so Latin America is it's a very bad idea

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.670 
so Latin America is it's a very bad idea
and<00:02:51.250> at<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> very<00:02:52.120> least<00:02:52.440> taking<00:02:53.440> your

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and at the very least taking your

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.780 
and at the very least taking your
audience<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.250> Mexico<00:02:54.820> alone<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> bad<00:02:56.470> idea

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
audience in Mexico alone is a bad idea

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.670 
audience in Mexico alone is a bad idea
because<00:02:57.790> you'll<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.150> put<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.600> jail<00:02:58.870> for<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> very

very long time if they find her if they

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.580

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.210 
belongings and I'm not going to fight
them<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.940> that's<00:04:31.940> how<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.830> that's<00:04:33.860> a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
them and that's how it is and that's a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.589 
them and that's how it is and that's a
reality<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:35.889> decided<00:04:36.889> to<00:04:37.190> accept

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.180 

and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.740 
and
I<00:04:43.250> think<00:04:44.000> it's<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.210> reality<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.810> is<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:46.750> too

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
I think it's a reality that is not too

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.400 
I think it's a reality that is not too
common

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.950 

I<00:04:51.410> think<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> mirror<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.240> think<00:04:53.570> that

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
I think that a mirror I think that

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.470 
I think that a mirror I think that
there's<00:04:54.230> a<00:04:54.290> certain<00:04:54.590> portion<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.490> people<00:04:56.390> in

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
there's a certain portion of people in

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.760 
there's a certain portion of people in
America<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.200> are<00:04:58.930> not<00:04:59.930> even<00:05:00.170> just<00:05:00.320> American

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
America that are not even just American

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.610 
America that are not even just American
but<00:05:00.800> just<00:05:01.010> everywhere<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:02.350> I've<00:05:03.350> watched

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
but just everywhere that I've watched

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.720 
but just everywhere that I've watched
too<00:05:04.010> much<00:05:04.130> news<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.970> they<00:05:05.060> see<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.780> much<00:05:05.840> death

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
too much news and they see so much death

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.970 
too much news and they see so much death
rape<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.780> but<00:05:09.110> just<00:05:09.560> overall<00:05:09.890> violence

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
rape and but just overall violence

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.750 
rape and but just overall violence
every<00:05:12.730> single<00:05:13.000> night<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.830> their<00:05:14.830> view<00:05:15.730> of

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
every single night that their view of

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
every single night that their view of
the<00:05:16.000> world<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:17.620> skewed<00:05:18.160> in<00:05:18.340> such<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.550> way<00:05:18.780> so

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
the world is skewed in such a way so

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.980 
the world is skewed in such a way so
that<00:05:19.810> everyone<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.830> bad<00:05:21.100> guy<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.600> don't

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
that everyone is a bad guy and I don't

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.269 
that everyone is a bad guy and I don't
think<00:05:23.140> that's<00:05:23.380> the<00:05:23.560> case

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.329 

so<00:05:28.879> ultimately<00:05:29.239> that's<00:05:29.929> thirst<00:05:30.319> and<00:05:30.709> then<00:05:31.129> at

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
so ultimately that's thirst and then at

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:36.379 
so ultimately that's thirst and then at
the<00:05:31.489> end<00:05:31.609> of<00:05:31.699> the<00:05:31.759> day<00:05:31.969> I<00:05:32.679> think<00:05:33.679> that<00:05:34.039> there<00:05:34.279> is

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
the end of the day I think that there is

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.480 
the end of the day I think that there is
more<00:05:36.900> good<00:05:37.530> in<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.770> world<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.219> there<00:05:38.400> is

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
more good in the world that there is

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.230 
more good in the world that there is
that<00:05:39.439> there's<00:05:40.439> actually<00:05:40.620> a<00:05:41.240> intellectual

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
that there's actually a intellectual

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.369 
that there's actually a intellectual
study<00:05:42.449> on<00:05:42.659> this<00:05:42.900> which<00:05:43.110> goes<00:05:43.319> this<00:05:43.500> is<00:05:43.680> Jeff

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
study on this which goes this is Jeff

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.770 
study on this which goes this is Jeff
that's<00:05:46.379> totally<00:05:46.590> for<00:05:46.740> another<00:05:46.949> video<00:05:47.780> but

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
that's totally for another video but

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.140 
that's totally for another video but
ultimately<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.349> wanted<00:05:49.889> to<00:05:50.009> tell<00:05:50.280> you<00:05:50.520> how<00:05:50.849> far

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
ultimately I wanted to tell you how far

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.059 
ultimately I wanted to tell you how far
it<00:05:51.270> is<00:05:51.389> from<00:05:51.419> st.<00:05:51.810> Louis<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.259> am<00:05:52.289> six<00:05:52.710> hundred

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
it is from st. Louis I am six hundred

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.800 
it is from st. Louis I am six hundred
and<00:05:53.189> eighty<00:05:53.430> miles<00:05:53.729> away<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:55.550> usually<00:05:56.550> go

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
and eighty miles away I usually go

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.450 
and eighty miles away I usually go
about<00:05:59.810> a<00:06:00.140> hunter<00:06:00.500> I<00:06:00.740> take<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.040> break<00:06:01.280> every

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
about a hunter I take a break every
