because she didn't use it so I had tried
this<00:00:53.610> actually<00:00:54.390> before<00:00:55.050> hand<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this actually before hand because I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.959 
this actually before hand because I
remember<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.199> before<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.260> had<00:00:58.469> seen<00:00:58.969> videos

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
remember like before I had seen videos

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
remember like before I had seen videos
talking<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.989> Monistat<00:01:01.500> anti<00:01:01.980> shaving

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

cream<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.760> everything<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> had

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
cream and everything and then I had

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.149 
cream and everything and then I had
looked<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:06.020> similar<00:01:07.020> products<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> UK

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
looked for similar products in the UK

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.990 
looked for similar products in the UK
because<00:01:08.490> -<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.619> in<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> US<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.490> then<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
because - that is in the US and then I

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
because - that is in the US and then I
had<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> come<00:01:12.360> across<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> learn<00:01:13.229> akin

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
had to come across this to learn akin

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
had to come across this to learn akin
and<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:15.180> chaffing<00:01:15.750> gel<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.180> basically<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and to chaffing gel so basically the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.899 
and to chaffing gel so basically the
reason<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:19.970> they're<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.210> similar<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.080> because

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
reason why they're so similar is because

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.990

a<00:02:14.319> dry<00:02:14.890> gel<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.299> thing<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.870> em<00:02:17.110> here

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
a dry gel so the thing is with em here

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.530 
a dry gel so the thing is with em here
since<00:02:17.769> they're<00:02:18.190> they're<00:02:18.760> meant<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.239> bring

shiny<00:02:29.379> even<00:02:29.739> though<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.280> main<00:02:30.459> ingredient<00:02:31.000> is

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
shiny even though the main ingredient is

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.819 
shiny even though the main ingredient is
timotha<00:02:31.690> con<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.879> anyway<00:02:34.110> both<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.530> these

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829

pop them onto my skin so you can see

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
pop them onto my skin so you can see
them<00:02:56.230> close<00:02:56.560> together<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.910> first<00:02:58.209> one

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
them close together so this first one

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.500 
them close together so this first one
here<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.400> the<00:03:00.629> anti<00:03:01.629> changing<00:03:02.140> gel<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.510> next

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
primer the only like slight difference

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.940 
primer the only like slight difference
is<00:03:12.849> that<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.540> lana<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.989> enter<00:03:14.260> shaping<00:03:14.709> gel

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
is that the lana can enter shaping gel

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.190 
is that the lana can enter shaping gel
is<00:03:15.870> slightly<00:03:16.870> darker<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.730> I'm<00:03:19.269> sure<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.139> can
