00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello girls welcome back to this new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.690
 video today I wanted to make with you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.210
 the video tutorial of this make up that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.309
 it's a pretty make-up anyway 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 colored a little spring and or indeed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.410
 used the collections for most 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.320
 part of the spring collections released 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 lately also to try a little 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 together with you making a trick e 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.539
 let you see a bit like surrender or maybe 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.400
 also my first opinion of bees 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.550
 initial concerns these products and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.570
 nothing i hope you like it is i leave you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 the tutorial start by applying a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 tiffany cream eye shadow in the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 inner eyelid of the eye is a color 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.610
 very flexible because more or less 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.579
 gradient takes on a more or 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 less tenuous and I must say that all 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.000
 pupa products that you will see in this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.980
 video regarding this only 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 brand of course are of the line 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 sport the cycles I have chosen specifically 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.660
 to show you that the new line 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 then I take the sangro api that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.299
 the 002 pat over an eye shadow in 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.689
 cream the same color 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.570
 however in tiffany powder and then in the other 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.520
 stick 001 I take the pale yellow from 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 put in the middle of the eyelid 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.049
 I must say that this collection to gods 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.090
 products that I liked very badly 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.320
 palettes are not among these are perhaps 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.310
 product that I liked less 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.460
 because light colors are in my opinion 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.720
 I don't know if they are little experienced or da 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.230
 define more than anything else 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 very tenuous and I rather love 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.190
 use the loaded colors then 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.400
 it also depends a little on your tastes 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.670
 then to define a little the eye in giving 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.150
 believe me nationality I use an eye shadow 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.280
 inglot 341 opaque this because le 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.770
 pupa sticks not just eye shadows like 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.710
 you see bright satin do not have 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.120
 opaque eye shadows and then always from the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.220
 002 spoon I take this sort of 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.410
 bronzed brown to start giving 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 a sort of definition to the eye 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 on the outside and smoke with a 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:20.200
 brown pen the colors of brown vi 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 like them much more for how much 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.180
 I have to say about the pickle 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.370
 that the number 0 0 2 is the palette that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.070
 I prefer between the two which is this which 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.670
 you see here then I take the brown one 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.470
 a little darker and I'm going to give even more 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.610
 gaze definitions by tapping 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.750
 the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.530
 still remaining fairly internal 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 not to avoid making trouble because 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.330
 I am of the idea that you are the dark color 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 and more must remain in the internal area 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.710
 to be able to define the look 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.710
 and fades a little 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.390
 then I take a cream color and apply it 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.920
 under the browbone also 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.140
 this one is an opaque color because already 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.120
 we have all the eyelid shining and 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.549
 then as I want to give even more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.159
 definition make it even more loaded 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.200
 look I take a black eye shadow also 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.510
 this one here and inglot I always go to 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.239
 just tap lightly into the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.870
 external crease of the eye without overflowing 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.870
 too much 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.780
 now I use in my opinion the highlights 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.840
 of the collection that is the mask that it is 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.049
 the maxi felt- tip eyeliner that I love 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.200
 and I can say that I love it because it is 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.689
 using muse for over a month now 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.090
 I can make very precise lines 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.250
 in no time even use 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.840
 in the morning I can correct it 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.910
 easily with a little water but 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.590
 despite this measure for the whole 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.380
 day 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.680
 then switch to mascara this is the bump ai 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.780
 super known for the moment if not 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.580
 mistake is also in promotions I do not know if 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.960
 still in promotion and still go 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.539
 always take a look at their page 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.340
 facebook which are 6 thousand promotions each 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:42.340
 time and then with a plus that you use them 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.020
 from the ground then if the color harmony of 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.000
 brand I go a bit to define 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.000
 a kind of continuity 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.400
 then it passes to the lips 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.320
 applying this new pencil line of 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.230
 cosmetics 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.360
 orchid as you know if you watch videos 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.660
 I use their materials among many 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.750
 years I like a lot and use it 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.560
 whether as a base for lipstick or even 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.510
 just like it was 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.210
 a lipstick her because anyway so much 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.910
 soft that you can also use from 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.169
 alone as lipstick on the cheeks lace e 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.940
 gas 0 0 2 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.110
 this can also be used as 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.960
 charge eye shadow beautiful but not 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.570
 used this purpose but there are two 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.580
 peach color and this one 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 pink in this case use 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.760
 this where it matches better with the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.729
 lipstick hands I prefer to blow them 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.969
 party because 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.339
 finally marries best with a complexion 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.650
 I fill my lips with every lipstick 003 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.199
 I think it's very beautiful spring 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.059
 load and very even a moisturizing one 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.520
 own moisturizing formulations but not 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:50.680
 that's why I tried it several times 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.779
 like it because it lasts quite obviously 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.449
 you have to be more careful respect the 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.849
 lipstick mat because being a lot 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.319
 moisturizer tends more to drool and 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.719
 nothing this is the end result 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.180
 I hope you like it I leave you here 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:07.650

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.650
