00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello Oleg will come Brest Hello 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 channel oleg nesterov brest 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 I am one of your subscribers to me very much 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
 like your videos i am on the cars myself 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.029
 I really like the taste and understand them 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.539
 just for fun as it were for general 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 development and with me this came 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.510
 disaster struck in what I'm asking for your 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 consultation here is my car passat 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:38.610
 b3 89 years and it so happened that I had her 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 broke in general a blow was a blow behind 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.370
 strong enough on the track to standing 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.219
 the car drove me at speed somewhere 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 about 70 kilometers per hour in general 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:58.649
 blow seems that not very much but 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 went left rack went to the door in general 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.350
 this is even the driver's door start 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.680
 the problem to close is not warped 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 the second door on the left side also started 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.490
 touch 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 next is the wing wing too 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 the dent left here the wing here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:29.040
 swollen and even on the roof right here on 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.799
 the roof too was blown away here so from places 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.420
 there is practically no gap here 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:41.820
 knife paint a little got off here is not 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:46.770
 general clearance here as something in general 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.929
 too gap incomprehensible 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.560
 bottom more in general, the body went to 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:02:03.689
 front door in general, then the back situation 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:09.959
 so that here all the bumper broke 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:16.170
 Kapets hitch too unlikely there in this 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:18.150
 side of this pair to the pier too but farm not 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.930
 so important here the most important thing 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:28.010
 automotive body in general is such a situation in 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 the trunk is all dented here 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.140
 from this side where are these notches for 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:45.720
 tool, too, is all here spar 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:49.260
 so bent in general, but I got a spare 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.180
 pass without problems was trapped here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.540
 generally just turned out the trunk lid 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.440
 that 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.530
 the trunk is also in general the khan and and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.609
 warped over here thats gone bloating and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:12.590
 here on rails a little skewed 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.590
 here it is here that swelling has gone too 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:28.280
 so from this side 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:37.879
 clearance increased doors with this in my 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 stayed what is the seat no longer 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:45.319
 put in place and right here behind the seat 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:51.019
 behind the gas bottle here too 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:55.220
 skew on the right side is obtained in 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.950
 All in all, the blows were from the blows. 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:04.700
 sitting here it is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:08.950
 the bond is gone and here it is 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:16.930
 my driver's just twisted 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:21.340
 gone under dip bent in general 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:29.180
 I counted for her insurance 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:32.240
 1370 dollars and pounded to our local 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.550
 master they thought that one job 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.130
 only will cost somewhere 800 dollars 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.820
 plus they said i need to cut 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.930
 completely the whole ass and with the car dollars 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.490
 the donor is all cut now here 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.099
 question to you oleg 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:56.710
 Is it worth me that money and and do they 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:59.690
 I was immediately offered to pick up for 2000 and 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.960
 how should i do this 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.240
 Machine situation in general is good for 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.340
 the engine has no problems before hitting 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.880
 in general, it was practically 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.270
 trouble free on 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.800
 and how much I believe in it at all 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.800
 masters how much damage 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:29.140
 what should i do in general well then i 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:31.580
