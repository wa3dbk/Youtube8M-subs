00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 very nice people and welcome to tibi 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.200
 where will I show you how to download and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.170
 install the load plugin and the music for 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.849
 control strike 1.6 before I remember that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 to be able to install any plugin 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.980
 They need to have the sub counter installed 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.439
 the mx mod x which I'm going to leave a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 video to the description to install it and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.609
 also if they want a server appear in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.060
 the internet also left them how to do it 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:37.340
 in the description empezemos 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.340
 [Music] 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.890
 to start to have to download the 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.989
 musician plugin from mediafire from 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.940
 mega I'm going to leave this too that 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.339
 also on screen in the description 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.989
 then they are the same file so 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.989
 they will only have to download one 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.770
 and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.100
 as they are seen exactly as called 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.360
 muse and billions are rare files and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 They weigh only 19 kilos 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.550
 for now I'm going to download it but 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.550
 since mega it gets easier 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.310
 As you can see, it's almost downloaded 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.810
 they automatically choose where to save it 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 I 'm going to leave it on the desk 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.110
 [Music] 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.720
 Once you have it downloaded, go and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 they open elio rare they fix what they have 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.640
 as I should always do 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.980
 and this has the plugin and a guide 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.650
 installation that really is going to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.260
 direct to the video you are watching for 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.470
 install the plugin then they will have 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.260
 that go to your counter folder 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.080
 that have 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.450
 and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.030
 look at the folder that is extracted that is the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.800
 counter and here they will have to paste the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 rare asset content that is the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.690
 carpetita addons 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.340
 will not ask replacement or anything 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.340
 because it will not replace any file 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.730
 and well now now to mx x that here 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.189
 in we're going to do the whole first 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.099
 scripting file as you see it is going to 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.180
 leave there in the same place and if not 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.549
 has the folder it takes to create 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.329
 automatically the second ex-plugin 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.939
 obviously the basic plugin but the 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.739
 plugin is not yet activated so for 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.359
 activate it we are going to have to copy the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.459
 name of the plugin exactly how are they 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.040
 watching reading and a very low bass two 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.989
 points to mx remember the extension of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.329
 mickey are also copied they go to the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.909
 folder with fix and open the file 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.849
 point plugins and neither go down to the end 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.220
 and in a new line they paste the name 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.810
 Exactly remember with the extension together 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.380
 they keep it to me 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.569
 and now I want you to see that redeem 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 which it is the file operation 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.140
 here says that I have gone out to charge goes to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.430
 load the sound but a name of another 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.879
 mp3 sound then they will be strike or 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.620
 be back to cd path go to sounds and 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.049
 here they should paste the file that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 they want to be downloaded when they are 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.849
 loading the being the mp3 file that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.269
 it must have been without your name 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.650
 sound all of it together with bar name 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.290
 your sound point of mp3 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.819
 remember name of your sound point mp3 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.510
 and you have to locate a folder are 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.760
 once they have the mp3 file now 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.750
 you should try it so I'm going to 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.060
 show opening my server 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.060
 but the password 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.269
 yes 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.290
 [Music] 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.370
 I open the server and while I wait for it 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.140
 is watching server 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.140
 I'm going to open the counter 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.070
 now I will enter 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.290
 federica just opened that I have it in 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.740
 the cndh and they will see that it will load the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.920
 sound 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.920
 [Music] 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.420
 well then there would be the sound 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.060
 in its being some files are not 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.580
 compatible with the counter so I'll 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.460
 that I recommend the one that you set 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.210
 if your country drive opens them 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.930
 audio files doing the following 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:46.330
 they are going to go to their counter folder later 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.340
 you strike and then to song 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.900
 and there they have to put the file that 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.090
 want the audio file that they are going to 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.620
 try reading them for example today I 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.710
 I'm going to do this one called Santa Flower 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.129
 more fire point of mp3 remember not 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.339
 they have to take no separation 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.409
 and it has to be filed 3 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:07.779
 now after pasting the file where 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:11.819
 before low they will enter the counter and go 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:15.399
 to put the command mp3 space plate 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.409
 space are bar and the name of your 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:21.309
 file that my class got married start to 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.919
 flow more fire but the extension point 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.930
 mp3 do not have to put the propose not to 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.830
 arc 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 now the obvious 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.699
 and like this 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.680
 I think they try to hear that it's 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:41.210
 reproducing the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.220
 it is incompatible with the complete 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.880
 remember that if the file reads the 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:51.610
 counter has to call itself 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.610
 name of your sound point mp3 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.610
 I'm not going to change the name because 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.290
 I have already put it exactly the same 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.660
 also remember that the file 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.960
 locate centers counter tool / 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.910
 strike and sounds 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.340
 good people up here the video 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.789
 remember to comment if it worked or not 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.990
 and if they liked it or leave me like 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.330
