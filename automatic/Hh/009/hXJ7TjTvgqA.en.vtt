00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 yes, today I'll show you how you from 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.290
 a hercules great or keeps it 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.730
 optimally whatever your company 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:21.170
 Had you got this one like that ? 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.500
 aim this throttle on the handlebar 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.760
 mounted on it and that is a little bit 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.420
 complicated if you think so 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.500
 and if you try now 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 to push on that is not possible and the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.820
 slide out again and again and must 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.120
 to do it that way 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 here is a small bolt 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:54.719
 here you can see it smaller bolt the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:59.449
 gas handle here must have a small courage though 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.199
 this bolt in this loaded here 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:14.490
 that can not fly out and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:18.150
 we do it that way and then china 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.790
 grease that out important for that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:27.450
 even the same that I too nice 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:31.409
 boils and then you can already see 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.040
 it's bad and it's flying 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.040
 not out anymore 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 finished and of course the bowdenzug for 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.550
 gas was not injured as no host me 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.730
 think that yeah I hope you come 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.660
 help here had spectators 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.570
 asked here 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.420
 how this works I'll do the time 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.080
