00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.080 
smooth all the little ends and
everything<00:02:34.989> are<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:35.170> nice<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.830> our<00:02:36.790> little

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
everything are all nice to up our little

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.259 
everything are all nice to up our little
flat<00:02:37.390> spot<00:02:37.629> is<00:02:37.959> still<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.530> our<00:02:39.030> arc<00:02:40.030> is

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
flat spot is still there our arc is

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.830 
flat spot is still there our arc is
still<00:02:40.540> here<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.819> we<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.510> plated

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
still here and then we have it plated

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.830 
still here and then we have it plated
with<00:02:44.530> nickel<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:45.370> basically<00:02:45.879> this<00:02:46.180> boy<00:02:46.510> won't

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
with nickel so basically this boy won't

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.920 
with nickel so basically this boy won't
ever<00:02:47.140> tarnish<00:02:48.329> especially<00:02:49.329> compared<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
ever tarnish especially compared to the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.600 
ever tarnish especially compared to the
brass<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:52.750> here's<00:02:53.019> our<00:02:53.200> nut<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> full

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
brass now here's our nut this is a full

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.369 
brass now here's our nut this is a full
half-inch<00:02:55.329> diameter<00:02:55.720> brass<00:02:56.530> rod<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:59.140> have

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
half-inch diameter brass rod we have

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.390 
half-inch diameter brass rod we have
these<00:02:59.560> drilled<00:03:00.370> at<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.989> CNC<00:03:01.989> mill<00:03:02.230> shop<00:03:02.620> so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
these drilled at a CNC mill shop so

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.039 
these drilled at a CNC mill shop so
they're<00:03:03.609> pretty<00:03:03.790> accurate<00:03:04.090> going<00:03:04.720> straight

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
they're pretty accurate going straight

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.710 
they're pretty accurate going straight
up<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.410> down<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:07.150> we<00:03:07.299> have<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
up and down and then we have the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
up and down and then we have the
countersink<00:03:08.319> put<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.970> clean<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.359> ends

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
countersink put in clean up the ends

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.130 
countersink put in clean up the ends
from<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.549> saw<00:03:12.760> marks<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.420> bring<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.019> way

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
from the saw marks we bring all the way

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.289 
from the saw marks we bring all the way
down<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.530> shiny<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.250> then<00:03:15.489> they<00:03:15.670> buff<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.150> up

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
down to shiny and then they buff it up

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.809 
down to shiny and then they buff it up
so<00:03:16.599> it's<00:03:16.810> perfect<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.650> this<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.430> really<00:03:24.670> a

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
so it's perfect this this is really a

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.490 
so it's perfect this this is really a
nice<00:03:25.120> thing<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.540> found<00:03:25.780> these<00:03:26.019> are<00:03:26.200> chrome

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
nice thing we found these are chrome

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.210 
nice thing we found these are chrome
screws<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> number<00:03:29.200> eight<00:03:29.409> screw<00:03:30.010> with

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
screws this is a number eight screw with

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.270 
screws this is a number eight screw with
the<00:03:30.340> number<00:03:30.640> six<00:03:30.940> head<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.769> when<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.069> put

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the number six head and so when you put

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.699 
the number six head and so when you put
this<00:03:33.430> guy<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.940> there<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.419> looks<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.049> six<00:03:35.470> on

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
this guy in there it looks like a six on

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.089 
this guy in there it looks like a six on
top<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.450> has<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> whole<00:03:38.019> lot<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.500> action

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
top and it has a whole lot of action

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.640 
top and it has a whole lot of action
going<00:03:39.250> down<00:03:39.549> into<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.120> wood<00:03:40.419> and<00:03:40.840> what<00:03:41.440> that

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
going down into that wood and what that

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.520 
going down into that wood and what that
does<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.269> really<00:03:43.599> beefy<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.230> helps

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
does is this is really beefy it helps

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.949 
does is this is really beefy it helps
prevent<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.239> possibility<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.629> rolling

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
prevent the possibility of this rolling

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.990 
prevent the possibility of this rolling
forward<00:03:47.590> from<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.950> string<00:03:48.280> pressure<00:03:48.609> of<00:03:48.910> the

forward from the string pressure of the
strings<00:03:49.329> coming<00:03:49.599> across<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.849> put<00:03:51.849> a<00:03:51.879> little

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
strings coming across I put a little

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:44.890 
basic sounds from the 50s and 60s this
pickup<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.790> close<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.060> that

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.140 

we've<00:04:45.900> added<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.410> high-low<00:04:46.889> switch<00:04:47.340> in<00:04:47.670> this

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
we've added a high-low switch in this

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.230 
we've added a high-low switch in this
low<00:04:48.450> position<00:04:49.050> it's<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.380> point<00:04:49.650> O<00:04:49.889> 47<00:04:50.730> cap<00:04:50.970> in

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
low position it's a point O 47 cap in

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.560 
low position it's a point O 47 cap in
the<00:04:52.080> up<00:04:52.260> position<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.160> point<00:04:53.460> O<00:04:53.610> 22<00:04:54.270> cap

the up position it's a point O 22 cap

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.860 
the up position it's a point O 22 cap
this<00:04:55.530> O<00:04:55.770> 22<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.669> kind<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.090> closer<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.690> the
