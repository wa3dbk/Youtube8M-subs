00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180
 the exclusive note presented by 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.180
 boroughs and beauty plastic surgery 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.050
 last weekend the presenter 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.910
 of television ard albÃ¡n and gas came the 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.730
 farruco concert accompanied by his 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.920
 girlfriend and her mother but apparently 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.560
 the bride was not as comfortable as it 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.180
 we could observe that the presenter 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.410
 it was everywhere 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 - together with tamara 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.520
 I was going to fall in love, I warned you 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.629
 estimate that the next day we were going to 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 forget that we were not going to call myself 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 I said it, I was not going to fall in love with you 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.019
 I felt sorry that the next day we 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 We were going to forget that we did not take the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.780
 permission what happened was without warning 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.970
 and there are thousands that I accuse myself now 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 he said then we went to tamara for 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.379
 ask him about arnold since we went to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.940
 look for the presenter and we only find 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.940
 your empty chair 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.860
 the concert surely when not 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 the time of the concert with my girlfriend 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.710
 supposed 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710
 but with the ways 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.130
 do not 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:27.070
 It's not good, thank you, thank you 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.080
 in terms of being dollar to extract 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.080
 seat but open to the bride 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.149
 this company from Navarre is already out of death 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.149
 we are four months ago 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.620
 I tell you that we are super good 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.500
 Your company is like that 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.500
 just because you are zetas 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.970
 The good thing about all this is that having 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.490
 a good mother has also given a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.069
 good mother-in-law tamara since the lady 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.170
 Brigitte makes you very good company 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.140
 when her son leaves her alone in the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.500
 events to throw special lengths 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.960
 friends the exclusive presents flavor 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.960
 boroughs and beauty plastic surgery 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.680
 Well the truth is that I laugh on the one hand 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.989
 and on the other hand we are talking about 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.110
 the lady was going to a concert of 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.540
 reggaeton do not imagine I live loving but 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.269
 nor bullets were worth preserving because no 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.250
 he likes but let's remember that the mother of 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.500
 do not forget peace then when 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.500
 come to visit him try to take advantage 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.379
 the most time together now but I think 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 that it is that arnold wants to be 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.030
 with other girls because we do not see it 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.639
 doing nothing wrong but yes sometimes it goes to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.159
 bathroom you meet with friends or friends and 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.769
 we started chatting about something or 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.420
 either we do not know how much was the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.639
 while the he left but perhaps also 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.510
 What I wanted was for her to know herself 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.700
 in a little chat between women 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.670
 and in a pleasant environment as is a 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.040
 I considered tone I do not want it I do not see anything 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.239
 of bad now I am getting to know the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.290
 screen to the arnold court and the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.689
 I really think it's very 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.940
 excited about the annual relationship of 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.180
 a person who lasts a lot with his 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.150
 couples the last two were yes badly not 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.480
 I remember or not or I am not very fit 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.560
 great stockings and then a penalty and vargas 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.129
 both pretty media dying now 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.769
 is competing in 7th Street and she had 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.639
 a baby she in question with arnold 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.959
 it's a totally closed chapter and 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.730
 natalie on the subject of television and 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.980
 also modeling does not die too 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.989
 had his modeling jobs to this 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.849
 girl I have not seen her on screen I do not know a 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.340
 what she does but can not see 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.950
 dissatisfied with the cameras I imagine that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.229
 knowing that arnold is a person who 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.510
 it goes on television because obviously it gives 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.320
 the corresponding interviews and each 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.530
 who decides how to do it then very 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 bit controversial no but good yo 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.360
 that I think I would feel a little bit 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.940
 uncomfortable and the minutes are already passing 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.990
 because sometimes you can not chat 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.570
 a lot in a concert 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 no gentle music is not going to put you 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.440
 to speak 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.070
 I was going what I lived supposedly 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.270
 today when you go to the bathroom you find 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.060
 koval and known worse if you go to a 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.860
 concert but the fact that you're going with 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.960
 your partner with your cut to a concert 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.640
 that can not leave her much time alone 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.850
 although I have obviously been with your dream 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.990
 with her mother-in-law she thinks good 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.730
 chat a little bit good I'm with my 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.230
 girlfriend we talk after what do I know things 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.570
 well because in the images that leave 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.130
 he is very comfortable chatting up 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.020
 hands having a good time as if not 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.060
 I would have gone with his with his girlfriend and her 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.010
 mom to the concert I think that of that 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.060
 part is a little bit like missing 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.100
 respect towards both people like that but not 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.960
 we exaggerate carlos in this sense look 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.450
 for example with the girl who is now 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.680
 the blonde in the cap seems to me to be 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.050
 alone 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.660
 sometimes it happens that by telling you in a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.479
 concert to go buy some drink 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.310
 for something to lose of the group then 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.699
 maybe I told her look my friend go 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:48.070
 to come back let's wait a while and so that 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.070
 dear as they are alone as with their day 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.250
 the girls always stop in groups never 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.960
 it is known but there is for all the long and not 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.310
 we know if she is alone with respect to 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.289
 now are your friends had to 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.750
 take her where the girlfriend and hand was 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.599
 to the company 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.180
 well I rare so serious that tamara the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:11.090
 I see very excited when he says yes 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.919
 I came to the concert to have a good time 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.720
 share with my boyfriend and he saw it 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.830
 sharing with others not 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.099
 well I do not want to think that arnold 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.610
 banegas took her to mom so that 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.400
 take care obviously too 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.159
 I was taking a tour in the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.889
 concert and popularity of an area 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.629
 circular I do not want to think anymore I do not know 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.280
 found at the exit of the concert 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:38.710
 fertilizers is not only very good people 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.199
 always the sabbatical radio took very 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.539
 well I can create it with all the but 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.240
 If you like to go say hello, why do I say 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.310
 I do not want to think they were but I 'm going to 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.650
 say one thing I think it would be 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.050
 incongruous on his part because if 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.080
 you are presenting and you are sharing 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.449
 with the mother of your court is not because I 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.599
 I think the relationship is getting a 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:04.930
 little serious because it 's Isabel that's something 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.090
 that do not see much future does not go down well 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.039
 come out together you understand me 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.529
 finally she has been able to tell him 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.449
 look my mom does not come often lives in 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.750
 another city, I would like to spend 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:19.240
 time with her or whatever then 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.039
 He decided to sit down then I think that 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.020
 also that we all know what is not 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.150
 we know arnold that suffers a 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.960
 Very common and very dangerous disease 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.319
 called the camotera war 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:35.259
 then it usually involves legs 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.819
 and everything as we say then I think that 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.680
 Maybe that's what's happening to the 

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:40.659
 girl looks pretty nice I do not say 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.789
 which is the most beautiful of the bride that has 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.919
 had but it looks very nice or 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:47.319
 be very charismatic, we already sent you 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.300
 a special greeting to give us banegas 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.580
 we continue with much more of the 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.520
 program and now we have very good 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.029
 suggestion for all of you thanks to 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.029
 plus d
