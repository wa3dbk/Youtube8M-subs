wiring<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.629> amp<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.289> 0.5<00:02:10.619> ohms<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
wiring this amp down to 0.5 ohms and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.699 
wiring this amp down to 0.5 ohms and
you<00:02:12.459> know<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.330> know<00:02:13.450> low<00:02:13.629> homeless<00:02:14.170> Jonas<00:02:14.560> was

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
you know you know low homeless Jonas was

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.229 
you know you know low homeless Jonas was
had<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:14.980> thing<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.580> home<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> think

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
had this thing at one home and I think

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.140 
had this thing at one home and I think
0.75<00:02:17.019> but<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.379> don't<00:02:17.590> need<00:02:17.739> point<00:02:18.010> 75<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.030> know

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
0.75 but I don't need point 75 you know

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.570 
0.75 but I don't need point 75 you know
I<00:02:19.180> got<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> power<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.959> back<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.260> up<00:02:20.349> anyway<00:02:20.739> so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
I got the power to back it up anyway so

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.070 
I got the power to back it up anyway so
like<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.030> must<00:02:22.209> have<00:02:22.390> why<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.569> run<00:02:22.840> home<00:02:23.019> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
like I must have why to run home and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.820 
like I must have why to run home and
it's<00:02:23.379> playing<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:24.010> fine<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:26.110> only<00:02:26.140> downside

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
it's playing just fine the only downside

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.729 
it's playing just fine the only downside
about<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.280> amp<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.269> uh<00:02:28.409> once<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.530> fan

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
about this amp is that uh once the fan

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.710 
about this amp is that uh once the fan
kick<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.159> is<00:02:30.310> pretty<00:02:30.549> loud<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.510> know<00:02:31.629> they

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
kick on is pretty loud but you know they

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.059 
kick on is pretty loud but you know they
don't<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:31.930> bother<00:02:32.319> me<00:02:32.500> because<00:02:32.799> it's<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
don't really bother me because it's a

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.699 
don't really bother me because it's a
fan<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.489> blowing<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:35.290> keeping<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
fan is blowing so it's keeping the

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.289 
fan is blowing so it's keeping the
ampere<00:02:35.950> warm<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.579> don't<00:02:36.670> really<00:02:36.909> don't<00:02:37.090> get

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
ampere warm and I don't really don't get

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.940 
ampere warm and I don't really don't get
hot<00:02:37.480> at<00:02:37.599> all<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.989> don't<00:02:38.110> know<00:02:38.290> why<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.470> fan<00:02:38.709> kick

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
hot at all I don't know why the fan kick

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.300 
hot at all I don't know why the fan kick
on<00:02:39.129> but<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:40.599> don't<00:02:40.870> get<00:02:41.079> up<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.980> don't<00:02:42.190> get

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
on but it don't get up they don't get

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.490 
on but it don't get up they don't get
hot<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.579> all<00:02:44.489> what<00:02:45.489> else<00:02:45.579> I<00:02:45.700> had<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.910> say<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:50.470> I

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
hot at all what else I had to say like I

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.710 
hot at all what else I had to say like I
say<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.709> don't<00:02:50.890> get<00:02:51.010> warm<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:52.239> puts<00:02:52.629> out

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
say it don't get warm it puts out

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.259 
say it don't get warm it puts out
cleaning<00:02:52.989> power<00:02:53.200> another<00:02:53.500> thing<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.879> anybody

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
cleaning power another thing if anybody

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.630 
cleaning power another thing if anybody
decided<00:02:55.629> to<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:55.989> amp<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:57.220> best<00:02:57.549> that

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
decided to get this amp it's best that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.240 
decided to get this amp it's best that
you<00:02:57.940> hook<00:02:58.180> up<00:02:58.390> all<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.840> wires<00:02:59.200> first<00:02:59.739> before

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
you hook up all the wires first before

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.789 
you hook up all the wires first before
turn<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.329> power<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:02.079> know<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> know<00:03:02.440> that's

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
turn the power you know I know that's

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.080 
turn the power you know I know that's
what<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.040> supposed<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.640> some<00:03:03.790> people

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
what you supposed to do but some people

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.330 
what you supposed to do but some people
hook<00:03:04.959> up<00:03:05.079> all<00:03:05.260> power<00:03:05.530> wires<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:05.980> they<00:03:06.069> put<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
hook up all power wires and they put the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
hook up all power wires and they put the
power<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.760> ground<00:03:06.970> wires<00:03:07.269> in<00:03:07.599> once<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.019> got

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
power and ground wires in once you got

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.509 
power and ground wires in once you got
the<00:03:08.260> battery<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.769> everything<00:03:08.859> hooked<00:03:09.340> up

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
the battery and everything hooked up

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.130 
the battery and everything hooked up
that's<00:03:09.849> doesn't<00:03:10.329> no<00:03:10.420> no<00:03:10.569> right<00:03:10.750> there<00:03:10.780> because

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
that's doesn't no no right there because

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.190 
that's doesn't no no right there because
these<00:03:11.980> things<00:03:12.310> put<00:03:12.549> out<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:13.090> nice<00:03:13.510> electrical

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
these things put out a nice electrical

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.620 
these things put out a nice electrical
shock<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.459> it's<00:03:15.730> weird<00:03:15.880> because<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.180> did

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
shock you know it's weird because I did

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.690 
shock you know it's weird because I did
it<00:03:16.750> one<00:03:16.900> time<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.560> see<00:03:18.370> what<00:03:18.489> they<00:03:18.579> was

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
it one time just to see what they was

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.940 
it one time just to see what they was
talking<00:03:19.000> about<00:03:19.060> even<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.139> RCA<00:03:20.500> cables

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
talking about even from the RCA cables

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.190 
talking about even from the RCA cables
it<00:03:21.069> puts<00:03:21.489> out<00:03:21.669> a<00:03:21.700> weird<00:03:22.630> they<00:03:22.900> letting

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
it puts out a weird they letting

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.530 
it puts out a weird they letting
like<00:03:23.650> electrical<00:03:24.280> shock<00:03:24.609> if<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:25.269> do<00:03:25.510> it

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
like electrical shock if you don't do it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.789 
like electrical shock if you don't do it
right<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:28.690> mean<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.319> said<00:03:29.349> this<00:03:29.650> this

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
right so is I mean like I said this this

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.360 
right so is I mean like I said this this
amp<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:30.700> uh<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:32.379> puts<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.010> power<00:03:33.220> that's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
amp it's uh it puts out the power that's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.559 
amp it's uh it puts out the power that's
all<00:03:33.519> I'm<00:03:33.639> gonna<00:03:33.760> say<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:33.970> puts<00:03:34.150> out<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.359> power

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
all I'm gonna say it puts out the power

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.449 
all I'm gonna say it puts out the power
not<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.079> honestly<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.590> think<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:36.010> puts<00:03:36.220> out

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
not and honestly I think it puts out

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.819 
not and honestly I think it puts out
more<00:03:37.060> than<00:03:37.299> five<00:03:37.540> thousand<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.260> probably<00:03:38.620> say

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
more than five thousand I probably say

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.409 
more than five thousand I probably say
at<00:03:39.549> least<00:03:39.819> about<00:03:40.090> sixty<00:03:41.079> seven<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:42.040> most

like the results but uh once again got a
small<00:04:03.069> preview<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.489> this<00:04:03.609> amp<00:04:03.879> and<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.269> like<00:04:04.840> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
small preview of this amp and of like I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.330 
small preview of this amp and of like I
said<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.139> guys<00:04:05.260> got<00:04:05.470> any<00:04:05.620> questions<00:04:05.980> about<00:04:06.069> it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
said you guys got any questions about it

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.939 
said you guys got any questions about it
just<00:04:06.400> hit<00:04:06.609> me<00:04:06.639> up<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.150> uh<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.660> would<00:04:08.530> definitely

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
just hit me up and uh I would definitely

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.360 
just hit me up and uh I would definitely
be<00:04:09.400> willing<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.669> ask<00:04:09.760> any<00:04:10.000> questions<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.370> as

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
be willing to ask any questions and as

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.420 
be willing to ask any questions and as
you<00:04:12.459> can<00:04:12.699> see<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.879> got<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.829> dual<00:04:14.829> power<00:04:15.160> and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
you can see I got the dual power and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.379 
you can see I got the dual power and
dual<00:04:15.730> ground<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.489> feed<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:18.880> all

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
dual ground so I like to feed this all

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.409 
dual ground so I like to feed this all
the<00:04:19.690> power<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.169> get

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the power you can get

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.320 
the power you can get
so<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.289> said<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:23.069> got<00:04:23.250> triple<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
so I said I got triple you know that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.520 
so I said I got triple you know that
probably<00:04:24.599> would<00:04:24.719> have<00:04:24.780> put<00:04:24.930> more<00:04:25.110> power<00:04:25.319> into

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
probably would have put more power into

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.550 
probably would have put more power into
it<00:04:25.800> but<00:04:26.300> I'm<00:04:27.300> happy<00:04:27.479> with<00:04:27.689> the<00:04:27.900> dual<00:04:28.080> grind<00:04:28.439> and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
it but I'm happy with the dual grind and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.640 
it but I'm happy with the dual grind and
do<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> power<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.639> gotta<00:04:29.849> run<00:04:30.030> into<00:04:30.270> this

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
do a power so and I gotta run into this

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.939 
do a power so and I gotta run into this
you<00:04:31.650> probably<00:04:31.949> can't<00:04:32.159> see<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:33.710> gotta<00:04:34.710> run

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
you probably can't see it I gotta run

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.070 
you probably can't see it I gotta run
into<00:04:35.189> a<00:04:35.219> dual<00:04:35.490> was<00:04:36.150> single<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:36.599> dual<00:04:36.900> out

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
into a dual was single and dual out

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.020 
into a dual was single and dual out
foreground<00:04:37.849> so<00:04:39.889> why<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:40.919> said<00:04:41.189> sound<00:04:41.400> digital<00:04:41.849> I

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
foreground so why I said sound digital I

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.629 
foreground so why I said sound digital I
think<00:04:42.389> is<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.629> way<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.810> go<00:04:43.080> even<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.099> mids

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
think is the way to go even on the mids

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.429 
think is the way to go even on the mids
and<00:04:44.759> highs<00:04:44.849> you<00:04:45.360> know<00:04:45.449> you<00:04:45.509> get<00:04:45.689> to<00:04:45.780> 250<00:04:46.199> point

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
and highs you know you get to 250 point

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.629 
and highs you know you get to 250 point
two<00:04:46.650> which<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.819> damn<00:04:48.060> good<00:04:48.090> too<00:04:48.719> so<00:04:49.610> but<00:04:50.610> uh

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
two which is damn good too so but uh

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.290 
two which is damn good too so but uh
yeah
