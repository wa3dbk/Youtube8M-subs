what<00:00:55.320> we're<00:00:55.440> dealing<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.739> basically<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
what we're dealing with basically is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.110 
what we're dealing with basically is
palm<00:00:56.879> being<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> division<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.050> HP<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.969> as<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
palm being a division of HP and as you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.959 
palm being a division of HP and as you
know<00:01:00.270> HP<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.199> been<00:01:02.010> they've<00:01:02.430> been<00:01:02.460> working<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
know HP has been they've been working on

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.450 
know HP has been they've been working on
their<00:01:03.090> iPad<00:01:03.570> competitor<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> HP

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
their iPad competitor which is the HP

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
their iPad competitor which is the HP
Slate<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.409> they<00:01:07.409> were<00:01:07.470> thinking<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:07.799> using

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
Slate and they were thinking about using

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.190 
Slate and they were thinking about using
Windows<00:01:08.460> 7<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.930> they're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
Windows 7 for that but now they're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
Windows 7 for that but now they're
starting<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.670> using<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
starting to think about not using that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
starting to think about not using that
just<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.750> windows<00:01:13.530> seven<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> closed<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
just because windows seven is closed and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
just because windows seven is closed and
all<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> other<00:01:15.450> BS<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.590> comes<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.950> windows

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
all that other BS it comes with windows

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.740 
all that other BS it comes with windows
so<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> perfect<00:01:19.140> opportunity<00:01:19.439> for

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
so this is the perfect opportunity for

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
so this is the perfect opportunity for
HP<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.439> webos<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> palms<00:01:23.790> operating

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
HP to use webos which is palms operating

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
HP to use webos which is palms operating
system<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.920> their<00:01:25.920> new<00:01:27.080> slate<00:01:28.080> device<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
system on their new slate device so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
system on their new slate device so
definitely<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.180> would<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.659> nicely

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
definitely this would work out nicely

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.560 
definitely this would work out nicely
I've<00:01:31.409> been<00:01:31.920> reading<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.880> about<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.360> stuff

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I've been reading up about this stuff

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.899 
I've been reading up about this stuff
and<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.500> seems<00:01:34.950> probably<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> most

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and it just seems probably like the most

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.969 
and it just seems probably like the most
logical<00:01:36.150> reason<00:01:36.810> why<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.110> even<00:01:37.320> bought<00:01:37.470> palm

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
logical reason why they even bought palm

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
logical reason why they even bought palm
when<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.090> first<00:01:39.299> when<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.110> first<00:01:40.290> heard

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
when I was first when I first heard

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
when I was first when I first heard
about<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.890> buying<00:01:41.100> palm<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:41.880> hey

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
about them buying palm I was like hey

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
about them buying palm I was like hey
what<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> heck<00:01:42.869> why<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.409> do<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.590> but

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
what the heck why would they do that but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
what the heck why would they do that but
I<00:01:44.399> guess<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.909> actually<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> good<00:01:45.479> idea<00:01:45.680> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I guess it's actually a good idea it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.139 
I guess it's actually a good idea it
gets<00:01:46.860> HP<00:01:47.220> into<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> cell<00:01:47.700> phone<00:01:47.909> business

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
gets HP into the cell phone business

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
gets HP into the cell phone business
which<00:01:48.479> they've<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> been<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
which they've kind of been out of and it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
which they've kind of been out of and it
also<00:01:50.280> gets<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> nice<00:01:51.930> operating<00:01:52.590> system

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
also gets them a nice operating system

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
also gets them a nice operating system
that's<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.399> fresh<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.090> new<00:01:57.049> I'm<00:01:58.049> also

when the three came out but the 3g

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.940 
when the three came out but the 3g
cheaped<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.540> didn't<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.080> so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
cheaped out and they didn't have it so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.650 
cheaped out and they didn't have it so
um<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:29.730> definitely<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.510> nice

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
um that's definitely going to be nice

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.820 
um that's definitely going to be nice
when<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.080> comes<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.379> they'll<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
when it comes out they'll have the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.360 
when it comes out they'll have the
brand-new<00:02:33.410> four-point-oh<00:02:34.410> operating<00:02:34.950> system

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
brand-new four-point-oh operating system

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.710 
brand-new four-point-oh operating system
they'll<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:38.849> camera<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.450> its

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720

the<00:02:41.459> new<00:02:41.730> touch<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.269> i'm<00:02:43.080> assuming<00:02:43.379> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the new touch and i'm assuming it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.140 
the new touch and i'm assuming it's
probably<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.519> as<00:02:44.670> good<00:02:44.879> as<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
