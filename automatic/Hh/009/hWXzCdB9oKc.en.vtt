has confirmed some of the rumors that
are<00:00:36.630> floating<00:00:36.809> around<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.140> guys<00:00:37.410> apparently

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
are floating around but guys apparently

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
are floating around but guys apparently
is<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> run<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> solid<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:39.930> actually

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
is going to run at a solid well actually

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
is going to run at a solid well actually
now<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> solve<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.250> 30

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
now to solve it's going to run at 30

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
now to solve it's going to run at 30
frames<00:00:41.670> per<00:00:41.820> second<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.270> above<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.050> does

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
frames per second or above so what does

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
frames per second or above so what does
that<00:00:43.170> mean<00:00:43.350> exactly<00:00:43.379> well<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.280> minimum

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that mean exactly well the minimum

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
that mean exactly well the minimum
should<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.000> 30<00:00:45.270> frames<00:00:45.510> per<00:00:45.570> second<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.050> it's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
should be 30 frames per second and it's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
should be 30 frames per second and it's
going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.010> over<00:00:47.039> 30<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.850> give<00:00:48.030> me

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
going to go over 30 so it's not give me

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.639 
going to go over 30 so it's not give me
a<00:00:48.120> consistent<00:00:48.690> locked<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.050> frame<00:00:49.289> rate<00:00:49.469> which

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
necessarily always a 30 but it'll go

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
necessarily always a 30 but it'll go
higher<00:00:56.100> than<00:00:56.129> 30<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.730> don't<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> myself

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
higher than 30 I don't know I myself

higher than 30 I don't know I myself
personally<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> problem

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
personally don't really have a problem

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.529 
personally don't really have a problem
with<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> example<00:00:59.609> infamous<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> ps4

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
with that example infamous on the ps4

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.599 
with that example infamous on the ps4
but<00:01:00.809> implying<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.140> quite<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> bit<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.739> mean

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but implying that quite a bit I mean

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
but implying that quite a bit I mean
that<00:01:02.760> skips<00:01:03.090> between<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.769> 28<00:01:04.769> 240<00:01:05.489> frames

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that skips between like 28 240 frames

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370 
that skips between like 28 240 frames
pretty<00:01:06.060> crazy<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.869> don't<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> guess

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pretty crazy and I don't know I guess
