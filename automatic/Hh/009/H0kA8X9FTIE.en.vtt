00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
make sure that you're not doing this too

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.170 
make sure that you're not doing this too
tightly<00:01:25.830> okay<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:27.000> want<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
crank down on these stitches right here

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.130 
crank down on these stitches right here
because<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.390> edge<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because then your edge is not going to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140 
because then your edge is not going to
be<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:31.320> flexible<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.640> fabric<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
be very flexible so this fabric is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
be very flexible so this fabric is
really<00:01:33.180> flexible<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.140> need<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> edge<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
really flexible so we need the edge to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
really flexible so we need the edge to
be<00:01:34.950> flexible<00:01:35.369> too<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.390> scarf<00:01:36.659> isn't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
be flexible too so that your scarf isn't

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
be flexible too so that your scarf isn't
a<00:01:36.960> funny<00:01:37.170> shape<00:01:37.640> alright<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.119> working<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a funny shape alright so just working on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
a funny shape alright so just working on
down<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> line<00:01:41.509> there<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:45.860> ending<00:01:46.860> one

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
down the line there we go ending one

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.850 
down the line there we go ending one
stitch<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.770> passing<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
stitch at a time and passing the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.590 
stitch at a time and passing the
previous<00:01:50.250> stitch<00:01:50.460> over<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> minister<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
previous stitch over the minister so you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
previous stitch over the minister so you
get<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> idea<00:01:52.040> it's<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.280> straightforward

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
get the idea it's pretty straightforward

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
get the idea it's pretty straightforward
but<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.840> how<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:56.000> finish<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:58.200> row<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
but this is how we finish off the row of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.249 
but this is how we finish off the row of
