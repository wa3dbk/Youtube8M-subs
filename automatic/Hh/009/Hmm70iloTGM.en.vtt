00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
 in this video we will see how to create a microsoft excel graphic 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.350
 first of all 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.759
 we must have data entered in the sheet 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.039
 to then pass them to the graphic representation 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.370
 in this example, see more information about a company's products 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:17.119
 in the column of the letter d 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.289
 we have detailed the names that identify each product 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.300
 in the column referring to the letter c we have the quantities sold of each 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.419
 product 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.960
 to create the graph 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.210
 we must select the data of both columns as we can see 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.950
 louro we will go at least insert 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.160
 and we choose the graphic option or we can also enter from the icon 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.070
 Quick access toolbar 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.380
 As we see, a window opens where we can find the types of graphs 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.670
 available 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.170
 in this case we will use a graph of columns and as your type of graph 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.010
 we will select the adoption in 3d we press next to continue with 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.530
 the division 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.110
 in this part of the process if you have not selected the data at the beginning 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.150
 with the creation of the graph could have wrongly selected the range of data 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.940
 we have the possibility to modify it 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.200
 from this button we enter the excel sheet to select the data 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 and pressing them again we continue with the edition 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.420
 we can also choose if we want the series is aligned its in columns in 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.840
 our example we will use series in columns 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.710
 we press next 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 in this step we have different tabs to add data to our 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 graph 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.560
 we can put a title to the graph as well as the axes 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.240
 in this example we will put as title hardware store 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.159
 nlg and with demos quantities and on the x axis we will put articles 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.700
 in the next tab of g 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.710
 we have options to eliminate the axis values 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 and among others as we can see in the preview 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.390
 in the division lines tab when pressing the actions referred to each 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.140
 axis separately we can see how they hide 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.240
 or lines are marked in the preview 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.690
 we can also choose the location of the legend 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.169
 in the tab we can show the 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.339
 and select your location 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.709
 in our example we will leave it to the right of the graph 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.810
 we can put content to the resounding 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.010
 that is, we can add the name of the series or category 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 and the value to each column of the graph as 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.929
 we can see in the preview 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.279
 in our example we will add it the value 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.449
 Finally with the last tab we can add a data table 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.269
 below the graph that shows in detail what is represented in the graph 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.269
 in our example then we will add the table 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.700
 we press next we will have as a last step the option to choose 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.430
 if you add the graph of a sheet in anything with chisel carriÃ³ in the sheet that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.919
 we were working initially 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.959
 in our example we will add the graphic on sheet one that we came 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.090
 working so 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.470
 and we press finish to see the graph 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.200
 and place it in the sector of the document that we want
