00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
first thing that really jumps out when

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.080 
first thing that really jumps out when
you<00:00:30.310> look<00:00:30.489> at<00:00:30.640> these<00:00:30.759> guys<00:00:31.000> is<00:00:31.390> they<00:00:32.349> feel

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.179 
extraordinarily cheap like the plastic

extraordinarily cheap like the plastic
doesn't<00:00:37.179> feel<00:00:37.629> anywhere<00:00:38.230> near<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:39.399> quality

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
doesn't feel anywhere near the quality

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.599 
doesn't feel anywhere near the quality
of<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.269> original<00:00:40.840> RESCUE<00:00:41.769> BOTS<00:00:41.949> these<00:00:42.309> feel

really<00:00:42.969> big<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.660> beefy<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.949> feels<00:00:45.219> like

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
really big and beefy and it feels like

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.700 
really big and beefy and it feels like
all<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.120> pieces<00:00:46.359> on<00:00:46.660> here<00:00:46.960> are<00:00:47.140> very<00:00:47.440> very

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710

all the pieces on here are very very
durable<00:00:48.070> and<00:00:48.489> not<00:00:48.670> going<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.969> break<00:00:49.379> these

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.040 
durable and not going to break these
guys<00:00:50.769> don't<00:00:51.190> feel<00:00:51.789> that<00:00:52.149> way<00:00:52.359> so<00:00:52.420> much<00:00:52.870> they

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
guys don't feel that way so much they

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.290 
guys don't feel that way so much they
actually<00:00:53.199> feel<00:00:53.679> really<00:00:54.160> close<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.609> knock<00:00:55.059> off

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
actually feel really close to knock off

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.680 
actually feel really close to knock off
grade<00:00:55.629> plastic<00:00:55.870> but<00:00:56.409> maybe<00:00:56.589> more<00:00:57.579> dense<00:00:57.999> it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
grade plastic but maybe more dense it

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.029 
grade plastic but maybe more dense it
doesn't<00:00:58.960> feel<00:00:59.109> like<00:00:59.289> things<00:00:59.530> are<00:00:59.649> just<00:00:59.739> going

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
doesn't feel like things are just going

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.369 
doesn't feel like things are just going
to<00:01:00.129> snap<00:01:00.399> but<00:01:00.760> feel<00:01:01.539> like<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:01.870> kinda<00:01:02.199> have<00:01:02.320> to

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
to snap but feel like you kinda have to

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.090 
to snap but feel like you kinda have to
be<00:01:02.559> careful<00:01:03.069> here<00:01:03.339> a<00:01:03.519> bit<00:01:04.269> more<00:01:04.770> than<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.920> did

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
be careful here a bit more than you did

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.399 
be careful here a bit more than you did
with<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.460> other<00:01:06.670> RESCUE<00:01:07.180> BOTS<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.230> right

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
with the other RESCUE BOTS so that right

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.920 
with the other RESCUE BOTS so that right
there<00:01:08.470> is<00:01:08.710> kind<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.310> knock<00:01:09.810> against<00:01:10.810> these

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
there is kind of a knock against these

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.980 
there is kind of a knock against these
guys<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:13.180> know<00:01:13.329> make<00:01:13.630> them<00:01:13.810> not

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
guys to you know make them not

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.280 
guys to you know make them not
necessarily<00:01:14.829> as<00:01:15.040> kid<00:01:15.909> friendly<00:01:16.180> now<00:01:16.960> as<00:01:17.140> I

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
necessarily as kid friendly now as I

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.200 
necessarily as kid friendly now as I
pull<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.710> Optimus<00:01:18.189> here<00:01:18.430> from<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> original

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
pull the Optimus here from the original

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.910 
pull the Optimus here from the original
line<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.509> can<00:01:19.689> see<00:01:19.899> that<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.350> original<00:01:20.500> line

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
line you can see that the original line

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.030 
line you can see that the original line
also<00:01:21.189> tends<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.360> be<00:01:22.479> a<00:01:22.719> lot<00:01:23.110> more<00:01:23.140> beefy<00:01:23.829> and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
also tends to be a lot more beefy and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.399 
also tends to be a lot more beefy and
granite<00:01:24.909> we're<00:01:25.030> looking<00:01:25.360> at<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.509> motorcycle<00:01:25.780> so

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
granite we're looking at a motorcycle so

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.499 
granite we're looking at a motorcycle so
let's<00:01:26.649> look<00:01:26.799> at<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> dps<00:01:27.490> which<00:01:27.820> is<00:01:28.000> heat<00:01:28.270> wave

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
let's look at the dps which is heat wave

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.899 
let's look at the dps which is heat wave
here<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.110> even<00:01:29.770> by<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.880> that

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
here and even by that you can see that

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
here and even by that you can see that
there<00:01:31.299> is<00:01:31.329> quite<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> disparity<00:01:32.530> here<00:01:32.890> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there is quite a disparity here now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.870 
there is quite a disparity here now
where<00:01:35.259> these<00:01:35.439> figures<00:01:35.860> are<00:01:36.009> concerned<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.820> do

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
where these figures are concerned I do

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.569 
where these figures are concerned I do
feel<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.509> heat<00:01:37.750> wave<00:01:37.930> actually<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
feel that heat wave actually is the

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.200 
feel that heat wave actually is the
clear<00:01:39.820> winner<00:01:39.850> here<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:42.189> yeah<00:01:42.700> we'll<00:01:42.909> get<00:01:43.090> to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
clear winner here but yeah we'll get to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.789 
clear winner here but yeah we'll get to
him<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.570> guess<00:01:43.780> less<00:01:44.079> let's<00:01:44.409> start<00:01:44.680> with

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
him I guess less let's start with

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.800 
him I guess less let's start with
bumblebee<00:01:45.250> here's<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.119> pretty<00:01:46.329> nice<00:01:46.570> looking

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
bumblebee here's a pretty nice looking

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
bumblebee here's a pretty nice looking
motorcycle<00:01:47.619> he<00:01:47.770> looks<00:01:47.979> like<00:01:48.130> he<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.700> dodge

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
motorcycle he looks like he is the dodge

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.209 
motorcycle he looks like he is the dodge
tomahawk<00:01:50.490> who<00:01:51.490> has<00:01:51.729> had<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.439> know<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.829> baby

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
tomahawk who has had a you know a baby

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.999 
tomahawk who has had a you know a baby
with<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.899> kawasaki<00:01:55.899> ninja<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.469> this<00:01:56.680> was<00:01:56.859> the

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
with a kawasaki ninja and this was the

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.190 
with a kawasaki ninja and this was the
result<00:01:57.159> so<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:58.299> this<00:01:58.450> four-wheeled

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
result so you get this four-wheeled

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.679 
result so you get this four-wheeled
motorcycle<00:01:59.380> which<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.280> nice<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.789> does<00:02:00.969> stand

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
motorcycle which is nice it does stand

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.830 
motorcycle which is nice it does stand
pretty<00:02:01.990> nice<00:02:03.179> comparison<00:02:04.179> there<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.689> a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
pretty nice comparison there is a

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.779 
pretty nice comparison there is a
classic<00:02:05.469> hot<00:02:06.219> rod<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:07.179> too<00:02:07.600> big<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:08.020> hot<00:02:08.170> rod

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
classic hot rod so too big for hot rod

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.220 
classic hot rod so too big for hot rod
too<00:02:09.789> small<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.330> something<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.840> GI<00:02:11.140> Joe

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
too small for something like a GI Joe

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.280 
too small for something like a GI Joe
though<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.460> yeah<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.510> bumblebee<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
though but yeah there's bumblebee and

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.470 
though but yeah there's bumblebee and
let's<00:02:14.590> actually<00:02:14.830> transform<00:02:15.520> them<00:02:15.670> really

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
let's actually transform them really

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360 
let's actually transform them really
simple<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.440> we<00:02:17.590> stand<00:02:17.860> them<00:02:18.040> up

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
simple you can see we stand them up

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.699 
simple you can see we stand them up
and<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.640> already<00:02:18.819> see<00:02:19.599> pretty<00:02:20.019> much<00:02:20.260> most<00:02:20.440> of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
and we already see pretty much most of

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.890 
and we already see pretty much most of
the<00:02:20.830> bots<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.849> all<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.269> is<00:02:22.540> kind<00:02:22.720> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the bots here and all you do is kind of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.559 
the bots here and all you do is kind of
grab<00:02:23.170> these<00:02:23.530> two<00:02:23.769> wheels<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.310> separate<00:02:25.299> this

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
grab these two wheels and separate this

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.259 
grab these two wheels and separate this
and<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.799> actually<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.459> pretty<00:02:27.640> cool<00:02:28.090> because

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
and it actually is pretty cool because

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.850 
and it actually is pretty cool because
every<00:02:28.870> single<00:02:29.230> one<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.379> these<00:02:29.530> guys<00:02:29.799> is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
every single one of these guys is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.270 
every single one of these guys is
ridiculously<00:02:30.790> simple<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:32.680> kind<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.040> one

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
ridiculously simple and just kind of one

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.420 
ridiculously simple and just kind of one
motion<00:02:33.599> makes<00:02:34.599> things<00:02:34.989> happen<00:02:35.260> here<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:36.280> can

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
motion makes things happen here you can

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.390 
motion makes things happen here you can
see<00:02:36.579> as<00:02:36.700> we<00:02:36.849> do<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.840> arms<00:02:38.230> here<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.220> whole

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
see as we do the arms here the whole

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.479 
see as we do the arms here the whole
like<00:02:39.760> torso<00:02:40.390> part<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.930> bumblebee<00:02:41.470> drops<00:02:42.129> down

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
like torso part of bumblebee drops down

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.300 
like torso part of bumblebee drops down
to<00:02:42.959> let<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.110> legs<00:02:44.319> actually<00:02:44.620> spring<00:02:45.129> this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
to let the legs actually spring this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670 
to let the legs actually spring this
side<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.120> actually<00:02:47.019> kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.470> cool

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
side so that is actually kind of a cool

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.250 
side so that is actually kind of a cool
thing<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:48.220> know<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.299> original<00:02:49.390> RESCUE<00:02:50.049> BOTS

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
thing I know the original RESCUE BOTS

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.780 
thing I know the original RESCUE BOTS
were<00:02:50.440> all<00:02:50.560> pretty<00:02:50.799> much<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.250> one<00:02:51.489> step

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
were all pretty much like one step

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.819 
were all pretty much like one step
transformers<00:02:52.569> but<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.989> don't<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.530> something

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
transformers but I don't know something

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.430 
transformers but I don't know something
about<00:02:54.040> these<00:02:54.370> guys<00:02:54.640> are<00:02:54.849> actually<00:02:55.000> fairly<00:02:55.870> fun

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
about these guys are actually fairly fun

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400 
about these guys are actually fairly fun

to play with just cuz you know real
quick<00:02:59.650> you<00:03:00.069> get<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> done<00:03:01.260> Optimus<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
quick you get it done Optimus here is a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.240 
quick you get it done Optimus here is a
monster<00:03:04.359> truck<00:03:04.540> this<00:03:04.870> time<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.680> he's<00:03:05.859> kind<00:03:06.129> of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
monster truck this time and he's kind of

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.750 
monster truck this time and he's kind of
a<00:03:06.489> cross<00:03:07.120> between<00:03:07.180> your<00:03:07.959> monster<00:03:08.440> truck<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.010> a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
a cross between your monster truck and a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.270 
a cross between your monster truck and a
semi<00:03:10.450> truck<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:10.989> like<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.319> took<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.530> semi<00:03:11.859> and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
semi truck it's like you took a semi and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.490 
semi truck it's like you took a semi and
made<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.700> monster<00:03:13.150> truck<00:03:13.299> which<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.319> pretty

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
made it a monster truck which is pretty

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.800 
made it a monster truck which is pretty
cool<00:03:14.799> i<00:03:14.859> gotta<00:03:15.159> say<00:03:15.400> he<00:03:15.670> probably<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.450> one<00:03:16.720> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
cool i gotta say he probably is one of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.259 
cool i gotta say he probably is one of
the<00:03:16.900> cooler<00:03:17.230> looking<00:03:17.560> once<00:03:17.980> i<00:03:18.190> can't<00:03:18.909> help<00:03:19.060> but

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
the cooler looking once i can't help but

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.789 
the cooler looking once i can't help but
think<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.810> front<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.440> word<00:03:20.590> it

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
think that the front is the word it

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.680 
think that the front is the word it
looks<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.190> it's<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.549> an<00:03:21.760> Autobot<00:03:22.239> logo

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
looks like it's got an Autobot logo

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.500 
looks like it's got an Autobot logo
going<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.139> in<00:03:23.380> there<00:03:23.880> just<00:03:24.880> made<00:03:25.120> out<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.419> a

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
going on in there just made out of a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
going on in there just made out of a
grill<00:03:25.780> though<00:03:26.019> yeah<00:03:26.980> um<00:03:27.669> again<00:03:28.389> for<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.139> fact

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
grill though yeah um again for the fact

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.409 
grill though yeah um again for the fact
that<00:03:29.680> these<00:03:30.010> don't<00:03:30.340> feel<00:03:30.579> as<00:03:30.790> well<00:03:31.000> made<00:03:31.239> you

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
that these don't feel as well made you

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.809 
that these don't feel as well made you
can<00:03:31.599> see<00:03:31.750> just<00:03:31.959> how<00:03:32.169> much<00:03:32.230> like<00:03:32.620> things<00:03:33.579> just

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
can see just how much like things just

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.610 
can see just how much like things just
want<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.209> flop<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.370> sound<00:03:36.370> kind<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.879> cheap<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
want to flop and sound kind of cheap it

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.170 
want to flop and sound kind of cheap it
doesn't<00:03:38.980> feel<00:03:39.129> like<00:03:39.190> he's<00:03:39.489> gonna<00:03:39.669> fall<00:03:40.000> apart

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
doesn't feel like he's gonna fall apart

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.030 
doesn't feel like he's gonna fall apart
that<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:40.840> does<00:03:41.049> feel<00:03:41.349> like<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.739> would<00:03:41.859> be

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that we does feel like you would be

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.330 
that we does feel like you would be
rather<00:03:42.310> easily<00:03:42.730> broken<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:44.739> transforming

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
rather easily broken now transforming

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.559 
rather easily broken now transforming
him<00:03:45.519> again<00:03:46.269> is<00:03:46.540> easy<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.139> find<00:03:47.470> him<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.650> be

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
him again is easy but I find him to be

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.599 
him again is easy but I find him to be
maybe<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.840> most<00:03:50.019> difficult<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.829> all<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.519> them

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
maybe the most difficult of all of them

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.550 
maybe the most difficult of all of them
could<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.449> take<00:03:52.660> your<00:03:53.019> hands<00:03:53.290> here

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
could you have to take your hands here

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.300 
could you have to take your hands here
and<00:03:53.829> rotate<00:03:54.519> this<00:03:55.150> little<00:03:55.650> red<00:03:56.650> piece<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.280> here

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
and rotate this little red piece up here

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.720 
and rotate this little red piece up here
and<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.180> see<00:03:58.449> as<00:03:58.720> we<00:03:58.959> do<00:03:59.169> that<00:03:59.519> but<00:04:00.519> that's

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
and you can see as we do that but that's

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.800 
and you can see as we do that but that's
actually<00:04:00.970> going<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:01.449> do<00:04:01.629> for<00:04:01.930> us<00:04:02.079> here<00:04:02.379> is<00:04:03.810> drop

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
actually going to do for us here is drop

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.740 
actually going to do for us here is drop
the<00:04:05.019> legs<00:04:05.260> down<00:04:05.379> and<00:04:06.030> bring<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.060> arms<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.690> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the legs down and bring the arms to the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.490 
the legs down and bring the arms to the
side<00:04:08.079> here<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.669> I<00:04:09.669> find<00:04:10.090> reason<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.810> find<00:04:11.079> him<00:04:11.290> I

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
side here and I find reason I find him I

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.020 
side here and I find reason I find him I
guess<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.829> most<00:04:11.980> difficult<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.609> is<00:04:12.639> when<00:04:12.819> you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
guess the most difficult it is when you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.809 
guess the most difficult it is when you
go<00:04:13.180> back<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.889> gets<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.190> here<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.760> then

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
go back it kind of gets to here and then

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.360 
go back it kind of gets to here and then
it<00:04:16.000> wants<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.419> stop<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.959> have<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.340> push<00:04:18.340> a

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
it wants to stop and you have to push a

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.159 
it wants to stop and you have to push a
little<00:04:18.519> further<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.479> is<00:04:19.630> as<00:04:19.780> far<00:04:19.959> back

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
little further and this is as far back

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.900 
little further and this is as far back
as<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.530> goes<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:20.979> still<00:04:21.220> hasn't<00:04:21.370> clicked

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
as it goes and it still hasn't clicked

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.450 
as it goes and it still hasn't clicked
so<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.449> have<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> make<00:04:22.900> sure<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:24.130> get<00:04:24.220> both

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
so you have to make sure you get both

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.029 
so you have to make sure you get both
sides<00:04:24.699> and<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:25.449> it'll<00:04:25.690> click<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.740> one<00:04:26.890> more

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
sides and then it'll click and one more

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.070 
sides and then it'll click and one more
time<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.490> we<00:04:27.610> can<00:04:27.789> show<00:04:28.030> everything<00:04:28.719> that

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
time so we can show everything that

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.070 
time so we can show everything that
happens<00:04:29.740> hopefully

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.499 

as<00:04:33.080> we<00:04:33.379> rotate<00:04:33.679> this<00:04:34.219> and<00:04:34.999> there<00:04:35.179> we<00:04:35.330> go

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
as we rotate this and there we go

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.409 
as we rotate this and there we go
there's<00:04:36.289> Optimus<00:04:36.860> Prime<00:04:37.330> articulation<00:04:38.330> on

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
there's Optimus Prime articulation on

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.409 
there's Optimus Prime articulation on
these<00:04:38.599> guys<00:04:38.839> as<00:04:39.169> you<00:04:39.319> might<00:04:39.529> imagine<00:04:39.679> is

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
these guys as you might imagine is

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.549 
these guys as you might imagine is
non-existent<00:04:41.709> just<00:04:42.709> little<00:04:42.979> action<00:04:43.459> figures

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:44.559 
non-existent just little action figures

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.040 
non-existent just little action figures
Optimus<00:04:45.559> also<00:04:45.889> has<00:04:46.069> the<00:04:46.300> feature<00:04:47.300> being<00:04:47.809> able

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
Optimus also has the feature being able

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.889 
Optimus also has the feature being able
to<00:04:48.139> still<00:04:48.469> kind<00:04:48.739> of<00:04:49.059> crawl<00:04:50.059> around<00:04:50.269> when<00:04:50.719> he's

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:50.899 
to still kind of crawl around when he's

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.769 
to still kind of crawl around when he's
in<00:04:51.080> his<00:04:51.169> truck<00:04:51.469> boat<00:04:51.709> which<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.389> makes<00:04:53.569> me

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:53.779 
in his truck boat which kind of makes me

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.049 
in his truck boat which kind of makes me
laugh<00:04:53.989> a<00:04:54.199> little<00:04:54.349> bit<00:04:54.610> alright<00:04:55.610> his<00:04:55.699> robot

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:56.059 
laugh a little bit alright his robot

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:57.879 
laugh a little bit alright his robot
mode<00:04:56.089> there<00:04:56.479> so<00:04:57.080> there<00:04:57.229> we<00:04:57.319> go<00:04:57.349> there's

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
mode there so there we go there's

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.939 
mode there so there we go there's
optimist<00:04:58.519> and<00:04:58.909> heatwave<00:04:59.869> here<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.529> the

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
optimist and heatwave here is the

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.699 
optimist and heatwave here is the
obvious<00:05:01.129> winner<00:05:01.519> in<00:05:01.759> my<00:05:01.909> opinion<00:05:02.439> he<00:05:03.439> does

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:03.709 
obvious winner in my opinion he does

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.969 
obvious winner in my opinion he does
have<00:05:03.919> little<00:05:04.309> moving<00:05:04.789> fire<00:05:05.709> nozzles<00:05:06.709> there

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
have little moving fire nozzles there

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.759 
have little moving fire nozzles there
and<00:05:07.719> transforming<00:05:08.719> him<00:05:08.839> is<00:05:09.019> real<00:05:09.199> easy<00:05:09.379> and

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:09.769 
and transforming him is real easy and

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:11.919 
and transforming him is real easy and
that<00:05:09.800> if<00:05:10.219> you<00:05:10.339> are<00:05:10.550> wondering<00:05:10.969> he<00:05:11.569> does<00:05:11.749> not

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:11.929 
that if you are wondering he does not

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:13.719 
that if you are wondering he does not
float<00:05:12.259> I<00:05:12.499> was<00:05:12.979> actually<00:05:13.159> one<00:05:13.429> of<00:05:13.459> the<00:05:13.519> first

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
float I was actually one of the first

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.480 
float I was actually one of the first
things<00:05:13.879> I<00:05:14.269> tried<00:05:14.569> is<00:05:14.839> big<00:05:15.080> foldable<00:05:15.619> water<00:05:16.219> and

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
things I tried is big foldable water and

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.790 
things I tried is big foldable water and
drop<00:05:16.789> them<00:05:16.909> in<00:05:17.089> and<00:05:17.300> he<00:05:17.419> just<00:05:17.629> went<00:05:17.809> jump<00:05:18.589> right

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
drop them in and he just went jump right

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.339 
drop them in and he just went jump right
in<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.610> this<00:05:19.729> guy<00:05:19.909> real<00:05:20.330> simple<00:05:20.719> to<00:05:20.809> transform

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
in so this guy real simple to transform

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.889 
in so this guy real simple to transform
here<00:05:21.619> all<00:05:22.159> you<00:05:22.369> kind<00:05:22.579> of<00:05:22.669> have<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:22.819> do<00:05:23.029> is<00:05:23.360> grab

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
them like this and push this down and

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.019 
them like this and push this down and
lovely<00:05:27.169> lovely<00:05:27.409> everything<00:05:28.069> happens<00:05:28.699> all<00:05:28.999> at

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
lovely lovely everything happens all at

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.059 
lovely lovely everything happens all at
one<00:05:29.389> time<00:05:29.499> that's<00:05:30.499> pretty<00:05:30.889> nice

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
one time that's pretty nice

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.759 
one time that's pretty nice
representation<00:05:31.579> of<00:05:32.089> heat<00:05:32.419> wave<00:05:32.659> again<00:05:33.559> to

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:33.769 
representation of heat wave again to

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:36.549 
representation of heat wave again to
close<00:05:33.889> it<00:05:34.189> you<00:05:34.819> can<00:05:34.999> just<00:05:35.179> kind<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.559> push

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 
close it you can just kind of push

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.199 
close it you can just kind of push
everything<00:05:36.889> together<00:05:37.189> which<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:37.699> actually

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:38.209 
everything together which is actually

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.079 
everything together which is actually
easier<00:05:38.659> than<00:05:38.749> working<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.679> light<00:05:39.889> bar<00:05:40.129> what<00:05:41.059> I

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
easier than working the light bar what I

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.239 
easier than working the light bar what I
would<00:05:41.329> say<00:05:41.629> to<00:05:41.659> do<00:05:41.929> is<00:05:42.110> push<00:05:42.860> this<00:05:43.039> together

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249 
would say to do is push this together

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:44.949 
would say to do is push this together
and<00:05:43.729> then<00:05:43.969> make<00:05:44.149> sure<00:05:44.179> you<00:05:44.419> give<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.779> light

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:44.959 
and then make sure you give the light

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.009 
and then make sure you give the light
bar<00:05:45.169> and<00:05:45.319> extra<00:05:45.649> little<00:05:45.829> push<00:05:46.089> so<00:05:47.089> to<00:05:47.719> show<00:05:47.899> it

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:48.019 
bar and extra little push so to show it

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:49.989 
bar and extra little push so to show it
from<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.349> front<00:05:48.559> here<00:05:48.800> we<00:05:49.399> push<00:05:49.639> the<00:05:49.819> light

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
from the front here we push the light

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.719 
from the front here we push the light
bar<00:05:50.240> from<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.779> back<00:05:50.959> and<00:05:51.610> everything<00:05:52.610> is

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
bar from the back and everything is

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.549 
bar from the back and everything is
there<00:05:52.909> and<00:05:53.089> heat<00:05:53.419> wave<00:05:53.629> is<00:05:53.839> just<00:05:54.110> an<00:05:54.379> absolute

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.559 
there and heat wave is just an absolute

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.519 
there and heat wave is just an absolute
blast<00:05:55.219> in<00:05:55.550> my<00:05:55.669> opinion<00:05:55.999> the<00:05:56.209> best<00:05:56.329> wishes<00:05:56.629> you

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:04.519 
really a lot of fun more fun than the

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:06.879 
really a lot of fun more fun than the
other<00:06:04.669> tooth<00:06:05.029> in<00:06:05.300> my<00:06:05.360> opinion<00:06:05.839> and<00:06:06.169> full<00:06:06.860> of

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
other tooth in my opinion and full of

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.969 
other tooth in my opinion and full of
character<00:06:07.459> and<00:06:08.050> he<00:06:09.050> also<00:06:09.199> feels<00:06:09.559> like<00:06:09.829> the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
character and he also feels like the

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.879 
character and he also feels like the
most<00:06:10.219> bang<00:06:10.610> for<00:06:10.639> the<00:06:11.059> buck<00:06:11.229> so<00:06:12.229> to<00:06:12.289> kind<00:06:12.769> of

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
most bang for the buck so to kind of

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.909 
most bang for the buck so to kind of
compare<00:06:13.099> this<00:06:13.519> as<00:06:13.759> we<00:06:14.240> leave<00:06:14.509> this<00:06:14.689> here<00:06:14.990> here

is<00:06:16.039> our<00:06:16.189> Optimus<00:06:16.789> again<00:06:17.539> fairly<00:06:18.409> simple<00:06:19.009> but

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
is our Optimus again fairly simple but

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.869 
is our Optimus again fairly simple but
you<00:06:20.029> can<00:06:20.289> really<00:06:21.289> see<00:06:21.619> just<00:06:22.069> how<00:06:22.249> much<00:06:22.309> bigger

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:22.879 
you can really see just how much bigger

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.589 
you can really see just how much bigger
the<00:06:23.539> original<00:06:24.110> RESCUE<00:06:24.529> BOTS<00:06:24.769> were<00:06:25.099> so<00:06:25.969> when<00:06:26.479> it

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
the original RESCUE BOTS were so when it

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.449 
the original RESCUE BOTS were so when it
comes<00:06:26.809> down<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.319> it<00:06:27.439> these<00:06:27.619> new<00:06:27.829> RESCUE<00:06:28.099> BOTS

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459 
comes down to it these new RESCUE BOTS

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.679 
comes down to it these new RESCUE BOTS
are<00:06:28.699> fun<00:06:29.059> I<00:06:29.990> think<00:06:30.379> he<00:06:30.559> waives<00:06:30.829> the<00:06:31.009> best

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:31.689 
are fun I think he waives the best

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.999 
are fun I think he waives the best
personally<00:06:32.689> if<00:06:32.899> you<00:06:33.019> don't<00:06:33.169> have<00:06:33.379> any<00:06:33.559> RESCUE

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
personally if you don't have any RESCUE

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.859 
personally if you don't have any RESCUE
BOTS<00:06:34.189> seek<00:06:34.519> out<00:06:34.729> the<00:06:34.879> old<00:06:35.119> ones<00:06:35.360> before<00:06:35.629> you

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:35.869 
BOTS seek out the old ones before you

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.980 
BOTS seek out the old ones before you
get<00:06:36.050> these<00:06:36.229> new<00:06:36.439> ones<00:06:36.649> and<00:06:37.209> definitely<00:06:38.209> you

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
get these new ones and definitely you

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.499 
get these new ones and definitely you
know<00:06:39.110> these<00:06:39.769> are<00:06:39.829> probably<00:06:40.459> not<00:06:40.699> as<00:06:40.969> good<00:06:41.269> for

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
know these are probably not as good for

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.480 
know these are probably not as good for
a<00:06:41.539> young<00:06:41.899> of<00:06:42.050> an<00:06:42.169> audience<00:06:42.529> as<00:06:42.829> the<00:06:43.009> originals

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
a young of an audience as the originals

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.530 
a young of an audience as the originals
are<00:06:43.669> just<00:06:44.029> because<00:06:44.209> they

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
are just because they

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.490 
are just because they
feel<00:06:44.870> so<00:06:45.140> flimsy<00:06:45.500> and<00:06:45.970> breakable<00:06:46.970> I'm<00:06:47.840> really

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
feel so flimsy and breakable I'm really

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.380 
feel so flimsy and breakable I'm really
think<00:06:49.070> that<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:49.550> wouldn't<00:06:49.910> take<00:06:50.090> much<00:06:50.330> to

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
think that it wouldn't take much to

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.980 
think that it wouldn't take much to
break<00:06:50.840> out<00:06:51.080> the<00:06:51.740> arms<00:06:52.070> of<00:06:52.250> Optimus<00:06:52.760> here<00:06:53.120> or<00:06:53.360> I

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
break out the arms of Optimus here or I

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.140 
break out the arms of Optimus here or I
don't<00:06:54.950> know<00:06:55.070> bumblebees<00:06:55.550> a<00:06:55.580> little<00:06:55.880> bit<00:06:56.000> more

don't know bumblebees a little bit more

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.540 
don't know bumblebees a little bit more
scary<00:06:56.510> feeling<00:06:56.840> but<00:06:57.200> even<00:06:57.530> heat<00:06:57.710> wave<00:06:57.920> has<00:06:58.160> a

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
scary feeling but even heat wave has a

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.120 
scary feeling but even heat wave has a
lot<00:06:58.880> of<00:06:58.910> little<00:06:59.630> joints<00:07:00.140> here<00:07:00.380> that<00:07:00.770> look<00:07:00.980> like

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
lot of little joints here that look like

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.240 
lot of little joints here that look like
they're<00:07:01.340> easy<00:07:01.460> to<00:07:01.640> break<00:07:01.820> so<00:07:02.690> yeah<00:07:03.250> hopefully

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
they're easy to break so yeah hopefully

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.430 
they're easy to break so yeah hopefully
