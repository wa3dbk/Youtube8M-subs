00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
though i have everything covered with

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
though i have everything covered with
half<00:00:38.219> slabs<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> specific<00:00:39.840> radius<00:00:40.230> then

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
half slabs for a specific radius then

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.799 
half slabs for a specific radius then
everything<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> all

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
everything out from there is this is all

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.770 
everything out from there is this is all
18<00:00:43.140> blocks<00:00:44.180> actually<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.780> 18

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
18 blocks actually this is about 18

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.639 
18 blocks actually this is about 18
suffice<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> say<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.559> long

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
suffice it to say it's a really long

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
suffice it to say it's a really long
freaking<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> way<00:00:50.640> no<00:00:50.760> hostile<00:00:51.120> mobs

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
freaking way so that way no hostile mobs

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.729 
freaking way so that way no hostile mobs
will<00:00:51.449> spawn<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.140> come<00:00:52.289> blow<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
will spawn in here and come blow up the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
will spawn in here and come blow up the
cannon<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.420> there's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> mob<00:00:54.629> spawner<00:00:54.809> right

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
cannon and there's a mob spawner right

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
cannon and there's a mob spawner right
there<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> place<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there and we're going to place a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.970 
there and we're going to place a
pressure<00:00:57.000> plate<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.360> top<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.289> are

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pressure plate on top of it and then are

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
pressure plate on top of it and then are
not<00:00:59.340> probably<00:00:59.670> so<00:00:59.820> pressure<00:01:00.030> plate<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.390> top<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
not probably so pressure plate on top of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.910 
not probably so pressure plate on top of
it<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.020> will<00:01:01.140> activate<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> tnt

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it because that will activate the tnt

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
it because that will activate the tnt
and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> tnt<00:01:03.000> overall<00:01:03.690> alright<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and then do the tnt overall alright so

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
and then do the tnt overall alright so
this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> setup<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:06.960> pretty<00:01:07.110> well

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
this is the setup it works pretty well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.179 
this is the setup it works pretty well
