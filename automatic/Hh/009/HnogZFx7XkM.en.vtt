tips that you guys might not know about
blue<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:16.520> DMR<00:00:17.520> pacing<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.539> bloom

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
blue and DMR pacing so what is bloom

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.470 
blue and DMR pacing so what is bloom
first<00:00:19.289> off<00:00:19.500> what<00:00:20.010> bloom<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> expanse

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
first off what bloom is is the expanse

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
first off what bloom is is the expanse
and<00:00:21.859> contraction<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> reticule<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and contraction of the reticule on a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.660 
and contraction of the reticule on a
single<00:00:24.810> shot<00:00:25.050> weapon<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.890> bloom<00:00:26.279> isn't

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
single shot weapon now it bloom isn't

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.839 
single shot weapon now it bloom isn't
only<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.180> single<00:00:27.420> shot<00:00:27.720> weapons<00:00:28.050> but

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
only on single shot weapons but

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.209 
only on single shot weapons but
contracting<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> falling<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> bloom<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.650> what

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
contracting and falling of bloom is what

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
contracting and falling of bloom is what
the<00:00:32.640> DMR<00:00:32.969> does<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.809> I'm<00:00:33.870> gonna<00:00:33.960> be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the DMR does so that's what I'm gonna be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
the DMR does so that's what I'm gonna be
using<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.309> say<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
using here so I'm gonna say it's on a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850 
using here so I'm gonna say it's on a
single<00:00:36.059> shot<00:00:36.210> weapon<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.989> case<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
single shot weapon in this case what is

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
single shot weapon in this case what is
a<00:00:37.890> reticule<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> reticule<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
a reticule well now the reticule is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
a reticule well now the reticule is
what's<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> center<00:00:40.379> your<00:00:40.559> screen<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
what's in the center your screen the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.430 
what's in the center your screen the
circles<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> two<00:00:42.840> circles<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
circles you know the two circles the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.660 
circles you know the two circles the
bigger<00:00:43.620> circle<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> smaller<00:00:44.340> circle

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
bigger circle in the smaller circle

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.369 
bigger circle in the smaller circle
that's<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> reticule<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> when

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that's what the reticule is and when

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.910 
that's what the reticule is and when
that<00:00:46.500> expands<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> bloom<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.739> go

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that expands that is bloom so let's go

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
that expands that is bloom so let's go
ahead<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> jump<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.300> guys<00:00:51.539> first

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ahead and jump on into this guys first

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.779 
ahead and jump on into this guys first
off<00:00:52.440> you're<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.370> shooting<00:00:53.699> at

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
off you're just gonna see me shooting at

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
off you're just gonna see me shooting at
a<00:00:53.820> wall<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.420> DMR<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> basically<00:00:55.770> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
a wall with my DMR and basically like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
a wall with my DMR and basically like
how<00:00:56.309> does<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> help<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.820> get<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.270> DMR<00:00:57.629> pace

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
how does this help me get my DMR pace

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410 
how does this help me get my DMR pace
going<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.239> want

to<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:01.289> mimic<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.160> DMR<00:01:02.579> pace<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to like mimic my DMR pace go in a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
to like mimic my DMR pace go in a
private<00:01:03.780> match<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.350> start<00:01:05.250> shooting

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
private match and just start shooting

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
private match and just start shooting
until<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.240> pace<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.049> your

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
until you get that pace down and your

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
until you get that pace down and your
bloom<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> even<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.280> mine<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.939> can

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
bloom is even with mine that's all I can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.719 
bloom is even with mine that's all I can
tell<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.479> guys<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.680> why<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:11.220> I'm

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
shoot I do this a couple times you guys

shoot I do this a couple times you guys
have<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> couple<00:01:13.710> examples<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.549> things<00:01:15.030> like

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
have a couple examples and things like

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
have a couple examples and things like
that<00:01:15.390> some<00:01:15.780> another<00:01:16.140> tip<00:01:16.439> though<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that some another tip though that I

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
that some another tip though that I
actually<00:01:17.220> use<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually use here this is what I do is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
actually use here this is what I do is
as<00:01:19.259> soon<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> reticule<00:01:20.340> starts<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
as soon as the reticule starts to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.620 
as soon as the reticule starts to
contract<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.509> shoot<00:01:21.810> again<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
contract I shoot again and that way in a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
contract I shoot again and that way in a
that<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.670> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that way you know you have a time of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
that way you know you have a time of
yourself<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.450> whenever<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> shoot<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
yourself so whenever you shoot the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
yourself so whenever you shoot the
reticule<00:01:28.740> expands<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.430> starts<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
reticule expands when it starts to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
reticule expands when it starts to
contract<00:01:29.939> again<00:01:30.540> shoot<00:01:30.869> again<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:32.100> is

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
contract again shoot again and that is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
contract again shoot again and that is
how<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> keep<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.820> DMR<00:01:33.299> pace<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
how I keep my DMR pace going and here I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
how I keep my DMR pace going and here I
actually<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.750> little

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
actually have to kind of do it a little

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
actually have to kind of do it a little
bit<00:01:37.170> differently<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
bit differently and I don't do that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
bit differently and I don't do that
always<00:01:38.790> other<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> expand<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.990> more

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
always other to expand a little bit more

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.230 
always other to expand a little bit more
simply<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> perfect

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
simply because it's not like a perfect

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760 
simply because it's not like a perfect
five<00:01:42.570> shot<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.990> things<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.500> but

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
five shot and things like that but

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.139 
five shot and things like that but
that's<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> reticule

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that's what I do when the reticule

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's what I do when the reticule
expands<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.750> starts<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> contract<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.530> shoot

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
expands and starts to contract I shoot

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920 
expands and starts to contract I shoot
again<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.430> here's<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.820> weird<00:01:48.360> tip<00:01:48.689> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
again now here's an weird tip or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.389 
again now here's an weird tip or
something<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.009> people<00:01:50.220> don't

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
something that a lot of people don't

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
something that a lot of people don't
know<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.640> apparently<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> shoot

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
know about apparently I'm going to shoot

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.249 
know about apparently I'm going to shoot
a<00:01:52.200> full<00:01:52.500> clip<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.920> DMR<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.140> way

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
a full clip of DMR out here and that way

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.840 
a full clip of DMR out here and that way
you<00:01:55.320> guys<00:01:55.500> have<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> reference<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.430> I'm

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you guys have a reference and then I'm

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
you guys have a reference and then I'm
going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> crouch<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> shoot<00:01:57.689> another<00:01:57.810> full

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
going to crouch and shoot another full

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.709 
going to crouch and shoot another full
clip<00:01:58.500> out<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.340> crouch<00:01:59.640> your<00:02:00.119> reticule

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
clip out when you crouch your reticule

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.770 
clip out when you crouch your reticule
actually<00:02:01.380> contracts<00:02:02.189> quicker<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
actually contracts quicker so it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
actually contracts quicker so it
actually<00:02:03.960> comes<00:02:04.409> together<00:02:04.590> quicker<00:02:05.130> than<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
actually comes together quicker than it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280 
actually comes together quicker than it
does<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:05.969> you're<00:02:06.119> standing<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
does when you're standing up this is

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.449 
does when you're standing up this is
something<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.680> lot<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.950> people<00:02:08.160> didn't<00:02:08.399> know

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
something a lot of people didn't know

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
something a lot of people didn't know
and<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.119> thought<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:09.989> common

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and I thought it was pretty much common

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.820 
and I thought it was pretty much common
knowledge<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.800> AOH<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> apparently<00:02:12.180> not

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
knowledge on AOH and apparently not

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
knowledge on AOH and apparently not
as<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.580> guys<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:14.940> here's<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
as you guys can see here's a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.570 
as you guys can see here's a
side-by-side<00:02:16.040> crouching<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> Left

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
side-by-side crouching is on the Left

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790 
side-by-side crouching is on the Left
standing<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.150> right<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.600> what<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> is

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
standing is on the right and what it is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
standing is on the right and what it is
is<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.340> guys<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.760> watch<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.180> fullscreen

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
is you guys can watch this fullscreen

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.020 
is you guys can watch this fullscreen
720p<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> better<00:02:22.710> but<00:02:22.980> crouching<00:02:23.850> will

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
720p to see it better but crouching will

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.240 
720p to see it better but crouching will
finish<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.450> couple<00:02:24.690> bullets<00:02:25.020> before<00:02:25.380> standing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
finish a couple bullets before standing

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.390 
finish a couple bullets before standing
proving<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.560> standing<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.680> actually<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> mean

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
proving that standing is actually I mean

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.330 
proving that standing is actually I mean
crouching<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.480> makes<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.750> reticule

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
crouching actually makes your reticule

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.460 
crouching actually makes your reticule
contract<00:02:32.340> quicker<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.120> there's<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.170> hope

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
contract quicker so there's that I hope

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960 
contract quicker so there's that I hope
