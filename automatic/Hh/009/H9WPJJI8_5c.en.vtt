00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.340
 good other inventions to the new videos 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.160
 this is a retrograde analysis or a 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.049
 pretty peculiar game of precision 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.150
 it is all vÃ©lez exclusive tenacity and costs 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.379
 about ten euros or so and it's free 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.969
 for the same the plus when you are 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.129
 watching and is saying one is a game 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.449
 like any other not what we are 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.310
 watching is the game starting with the 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.460
 end of the game starts if the game 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.230
 starts at the end it 's totally very 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.400
 novelty I say it very seriously for me 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.339
 It has seemed one of the most 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.839
 innovative I've ever seen and I really 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.300
 It has been a pleasant surprise to see how 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.039
 start and the style of play and that is 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.420
 everything that hides behind him started 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.680
 as you see with the credits we have 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.170
 destroyed from nothing the end and good 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.940
 everything starts from the cia behind what is going 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.309
 this game basically good this game 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.960
 it goes and it has very simple controls 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.340
 what comes from left to right are 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.719
 the bullets that they have given us to the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.100
 enemies and what comes from right to 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.440
 left are the bullets that we have 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.620
 property have been given we have 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.289
 33 lines each of the lines has 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.660
 a different color and when one of the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.769
 bullets that comes from right to left 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.089
 to control the ship what we have 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.500
 what to do is give the x is not like 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.110
 we would have fired in that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.860
 moment already basically as if they were 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.150
 in the musical game or this kind of 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.550
 for example we will be watching as the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.470
 room x when it comes waves of colors that 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.870
 You see, changing lines and such 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.810
 we have our power apps also that 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.040
 they are as you can see in the bar below 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.650
 yellow did not have more points and such 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.100
 even the score goes back 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.840
 especially I find super super 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 well the game the truth I thought 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.620
 a very very good game and not only for the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.880
 theme that you are seeing but so 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.080
 you're going to hear next by 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 novelty with a piece so that 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160
 listen to what is cool that is also the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.350
 Music is also a musical game 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.090
 apart from being a shooting game and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 well I leave you a piece for what 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 listen 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 you 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.789
 if not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.230
 no no 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 ah 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.849
 the truth that the surprise of this game 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.200
 they do not end where you have seen 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.390
 that we have in the special moment the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.860
 our as simple as it seems the same 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.840
 you have these special moments of the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.819
 we have enough style we have to 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.060
 Quickly press the x button to 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.519
 basically, so to be able to write that is 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.590
 a lot of things that we throw as if 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.620
 were the kinematics when the mode comes out 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.510
 of scoring we see everything again towards 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.819
 forward mdc behind as we have done 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.340
 and also that we have failed is quite 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.560
 pretty good or what they gave would be 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.510
 seemed very very very good that we have 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.209
 moments when we have to leave 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.370
 pressed the button x different things not 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.090
 the only thing just because the mega had the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.040
 game maybe it's your short 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.560
 duration by style one way in the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.000
 shortage of topics but I understand 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 really the developers of those of 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.650
 some games being afraid that the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 Mojo does not work by being afraid that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.629
 good you're looking from behind I'm 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.840
 seeing that everything is going forward when 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.180
 you see things when you see the score 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.950
 and such and really I understand the networks 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.989
 have a little fear to say 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.000
 for saying something that can not work 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.739
 the game and such and want to shorten it by 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 say it a little bit the game 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.190
 you are not seeing as I say the moments 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.349
 specials that we have to leave pressed 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.910
 the button is like a game 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.190
 musical is not like it's me that is 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.609
 Guitar Hero with command and is already 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.400
 but with ships 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.009
 old shutter and such the truth jan 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.719
 it seemed quite pretty good and I 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.090
 I was getting a big smile this 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.800
 this game really totally 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.150
 recommended if you are not from the club, 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.430
 you will have free with which then it will have 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.710
 to spend about ten euros more or 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.139
 less than a I see it pretty enough 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.729
 well I say it's worth the game 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.710
 for having something different and playing something 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.479
 different try to overcome it overcome or 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.620
 if such I recommended as always steel 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.469
 ter plus 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.229
 for 15 euros three months then you have 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:55.050
 quite games and such with 50 euros a 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.659
 year I just kids I hope that you 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.219
 have liked the game left again with 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.569
 another piece of the game and nothing we'll do in 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.569
 the next video next
