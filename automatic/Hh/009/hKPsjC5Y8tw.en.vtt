00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.270
 hi to all and guides who 36 and before 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.209
 to start this video done I wanted 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.130
 explain to you how it was done 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.869
 that there was a huge inactivity on 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.750
 my channel will do it anyway soon 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.550
 a month that I do not post videos 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.260
 and so that's just because 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.230
 that I have very very big problem of 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.970
 pc for about a month and a half and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.790
 it's very difficult for me to do 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.710
 my video montages and I do not want to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.239
 you post videos without editing the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.900
 everything so really things out of 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.900
 my camcorder 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.470
 finally I think it does not make it top 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.650
 and that's what it is for this 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.089
 exceptionally video my brother me 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.460
 lends his pc but it's not going to be 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.110
 possible all the time so I 'm going 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.659
 soon have a new pc 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.659
 so I'll have it at the end of the month so 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.480
 so how to say so at the end of the month 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.489
 I will have my new pc so start 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.560
 July so at the beginning of the holidays the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.300
 chain will resume normal activity 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.820
 what will there be poster videos 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.610
 quite regularly as I did 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.050
 at the beginning of my chain 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 so here I am going to let you watch 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.650
 the video she is more hello to all and 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.020
 guy he's 36 and today we're getting 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.720
 find for a new video us that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.000
 is going to be a tutorial video I'm going to you 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.800
 so show how to avoid the abuse is 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.729
 so in your glasses and in your 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.940
 airsoft masks so it works with 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.860
 all 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.900
 one is so who have glasses in 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.060
 plastic so it will work very well 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.130
 also with normal sunglasses 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.119
 what's the opinion of every day so 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 of course it had to go to 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.360
 plastics so for that you will have 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.060
 need dishwashing liquid and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.910
 of paper towel so that's a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.250
 technique so I found on 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.840
 forums looking for a little bit because 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.320
 that of course there are 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.410
 products made expressly tagolsheim need them 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.489
 buy and it does not always work 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:14.680
 so to do that you will drop 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.489
 so on each side of the green a drop 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.970
 dishwashing liquid 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.970
 so wait I play a little 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100
 Wow 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.659
 and it's a big drop I've been 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.959
 generous so here you are now 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.299
 are going to prevail has gone well 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.439
 spread over the entire surface of the new 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.439
 glasses or your mask 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.940
 do that you know I was everywhere so 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:12.870
 thought to protect your talent because 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 it overflowed on all sides we went 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:23.640
 so now so with the suites or 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.640
 to keep our glasses wiped 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.460
 must rub it dry it is 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.460
 am sure 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.040
 and think about taking a little bit of 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.040
 suites or so that is dry 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.080
 he stays a little bit too 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.530
 So here it is finished so it's 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.260
 not quite very well wipe so 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.360
 we can see some small breeds puts 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.880
 so by wiping well we will not see anymore 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.880
 traces and there if I suffer on 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.030
 you see there is no purpose and who 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.130
 so actually appears that but a little 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.960
 layer over the glasses for the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.790
 voices and noises slightly with the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.520
 light and so there my faith if you do 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.940
 an effort and you have a balaclava 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.770
 and that you breathe so the mist does not 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.540
 will not drop on your mask 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.350
 so it's still something 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.750
 very practical 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.130
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.690
 will have pleased 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.760
 in the meantime if you liked you 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.650
