looks like it is very low oh this is
cool<00:03:18.870> i<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.350> okay<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.100> you've<00:03:20.310> got<00:03:20.340> your

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
cool i like this okay so you've got your

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.460 
cool i like this okay so you've got your
ram<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.660> upgradable<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.290> 8

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
ram right there it's upgradable to 8

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.920 
ram right there it's upgradable to 8
gigabytes<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.040> ram<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.970> model<00:03:24.209> you've

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
gigabytes of ram with this model you've

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.539 
gigabytes of ram with this model you've
got<00:03:25.140> your<00:03:25.260> fan<00:03:25.530> right<00:03:25.680> there<00:03:25.739> for<00:03:26.070> cooling<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
got your fan right there for cooling the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.270 
got your fan right there for cooling the
chipset<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.590> probably<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> processor<00:03:29.130> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
chipset and probably the processor and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.130 
chipset and probably the processor and
everything<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.730> then<00:03:30.239> you've<00:03:30.390> got<00:03:30.600> what

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
everything and then you've got what

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.020 
everything and then you've got what
obviously<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.830> Wi-Fi<00:03:32.340> right<00:03:32.580> there<00:03:32.790> your

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
obviously is Wi-Fi right there your

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.090 
obviously is Wi-Fi right there your
Wi-Fi<00:03:33.420> module<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.140> things<00:03:34.350> like<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.739> i

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
Wi-Fi module and things like that and i

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.170 
Wi-Fi module and things like that and i
won't<00:03:35.310> go<00:03:35.430> much<00:03:35.610> further<00:03:35.790> than<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.150> because

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
won't go much further than that because

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.990 
won't go much further than that because
i'm<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:36.959> going<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.200> deal<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> next

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
i'm not going to deal in the next

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.670 
i'm not going to deal in the next
I<00:03:38.030> will<00:03:38.180> probably<00:03:38.540> destroy<00:03:38.690> this<00:03:38.990> in<00:03:39.170> some<00:03:39.410> way

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
I will probably destroy this in some way

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.490 
I will probably destroy this in some way
or<00:03:40.310> another<00:03:40.340> okay<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:41.930> will<00:03:42.140> be<00:03:42.290> fun

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
or another okay now this will be fun

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.010 
or another okay now this will be fun
getting<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:42.950> back<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.370> okay<00:03:43.820> i<00:03:44.060> guess<00:03:44.600> i<00:03:44.780> put

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
getting this back on okay i guess i put

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:54.010 
getting this back on okay i guess i put
it<00:03:45.140> right<00:03:45.380> there<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.990> then<00:03:48.440> kind<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.490> twist<00:03:49.760> it

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020
