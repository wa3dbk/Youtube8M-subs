expansion, we took the rubber.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.678
the dismantle.

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:30.234
We took the carrier bands and bands.

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:35.225
If this downhill is recommended that you also
brake with the engine, so that the bells not

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.521
crystallize overheat and asbestos.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.811
then with a Phillips screwdriver
we get the speedometer guaya

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:44.333
We had to clean the hood,

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.782
If you use your bike much tensione
the brake every 8 days.

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:51.572
Guaya put the speedometer.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:55.483
You should be aware of the brakes,
if too long tensiÃ³nelos.

00:00:56.818 --> 00:00:57.166
That tire is free.

00:00:57.856 --> 00:00:59.674
Bands placed in the carrier bands.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:05.229
each that the bands are worn or not
see asbestos, that can replace lead

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.039
damage to the hood.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:12.841
proceed to put the brake cable
and place it in the carrier bands

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.046
greased and put the axle of the wheel.

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:20.187
finished putting the rim.

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:23.791
we stress we put the rubber and brake

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:28.512
The brake can change each year, this
is depending on the use of the bike.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:34.007
If you ride your bike much weight will obviously
is being spent faster brake.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.199
The good thing about the campaign brakes is that
these have a guide and as we glance

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.358
time bands used.

00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:47.131
the tire must be free while
paste is used to the bell.

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.017
Ready and proceed to put the washer and nut.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:58.460
There are times when one puts new bands and you
doing maintenance at 2 or 3 months they start to scream,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.576
is that the brand is very bad, recommended
Japanese original bands or ride him.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:09.179
When this screaming, immediately lower
that the tire might burst a spring

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.279
of the bands and this would harm the bell or the
Wear dust asbestos.
