weave<00:00:22.590> right<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> come<00:00:24.750> back<00:00:24.869> after

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
weave right up here and come back after

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
weave right up here and come back after
that's<00:00:25.410> done<00:00:25.680> because<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that's done because it's going to be a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.269 
that's done because it's going to be a
big<00:00:26.880> help<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.269> understanding<00:00:27.740> how<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
big help in understanding how to get the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.470 
big help in understanding how to get the
archer<00:00:29.580> weave<00:00:29.730> down<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> archer<00:00:32.910> weave<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
archer weave down the archer weave is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.209 
archer weave down the archer weave is
pretty<00:00:34.230> cool<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> those

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
pretty cool because it's one of those

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
pretty cool because it's one of those
things<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> few<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.090> learn<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.540> weaves

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
things that a few you learn your weaves

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
things that a few you learn your weaves
and<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> course<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.649> forwards<00:00:38.610> weaves<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and of course your forwards weaves your

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.619 
and of course your forwards weaves your
reverse<00:00:39.719> weaves<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.820> your

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
reverse weaves and you know your your

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.389 
reverse weaves and you know your your
your<00:00:42.660> 4b<00:00:43.170> fountains<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.010> they're

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
your 4b fountains and the like they're

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
your 4b fountains and the like they're
they're<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> dead<00:00:45.660> period<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they're kind of is this dead period that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.840 
they're kind of is this dead period that
you<00:00:46.680> come<00:00:46.860> into<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.460> weaves<00:00:47.670> where

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you come into with your weaves where

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
you come into with your weaves where
you're<00:00:47.940> wondering<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.360> exactly<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.960> do

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
you're wondering what exactly you can do

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
you're wondering what exactly you can do
with<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.379> next<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.219> archer<00:00:50.579> weave<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
with them next the archer weave is a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
with them next the archer weave is a
great<00:00:51.989> move<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> learn<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.980> sets<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
great move to learn because it sets you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
great move to learn because it sets you
up<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.730> lot<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> body<00:00:54.239> tracing<00:00:54.780> which<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> an

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
up for a lot of body tracing which is an

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.310 
up for a lot of body tracing which is an
excellent<00:00:56.129> class<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.879> intermediate<00:00:57.840> point

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
excellent class of intermediate point

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.569 
excellent class of intermediate point
and<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> hard<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> get

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and it's not actually that hard to get

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.020 
and it's not actually that hard to get
down

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
down

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
down
it<00:01:00.329> looks<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.870> confusing<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.859> looks<00:01:02.370> can

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it looks really confusing but looks can

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
it looks really confusing but looks can
be<00:01:02.579> very<00:01:02.699> deceiving<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.559> here<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.650> we're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
be very deceiving here here so we're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
be very deceiving here here so we're
going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> start<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> those<00:01:06.689> ways

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going to start off now one of those ways

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
going to start off now one of those ways
that<00:01:06.960> people<00:01:07.380> frequently<00:01:08.000> learn<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that people frequently learn the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.899 
that people frequently learn the
three-beat<00:01:10.290> weave<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.250> playing<00:01:11.640> around

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
three-beat weave is by playing around

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.210 
three-beat weave is by playing around
with<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.390> sort<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.290> gonna<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.710> over

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
with this sort of I'm gonna go over

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
with this sort of I'm gonna go over
under<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:15.390> kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> method<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.439> here

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
under back kind of method right here

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
under back kind of method right here
yeah<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.960> take

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
yeah and when we do that we kind of take

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
yeah and when we do that we kind of take
for<00:01:19.140> granted<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.400> sit<00:01:20.729> our

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for granted that we can just sit our

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
for granted that we can just sit our
opposite<00:01:21.390> hand<00:01:21.420> directly<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.590> front<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> us

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
opposite hand directly in front of us

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.820 
opposite hand directly in front of us
like<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:24.200> ploy<00:01:25.200> works<00:01:25.500> its<00:01:25.680> way

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
like this as our ploy works its way

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
like this as our ploy works its way
around<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.930> legit

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
around it right but it's just as legit

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
around it right but it's just as legit
an<00:01:28.350> option<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> stick<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> hand<00:01:29.549> directly

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
an option to stick that hand directly

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
an option to stick that hand directly
out<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.270> front<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.780> far<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
out in front of you as far as it can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
out in front of you as far as it can
reach<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.939> because

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
reach and to do the same thing because

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.140 
reach and to do the same thing because
it<00:01:33.420> turns<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.579> movements<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it turns out that the movements that the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
it turns out that the movements that the
point<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.020> are<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.890> dependent<00:01:38.460> upon

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
point is to do are not dependent upon

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
point is to do are not dependent upon
where<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.150> other<00:01:39.240> hand<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.110> find

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
where that other hand is you might find

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.929 
where that other hand is you might find
you<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> move<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.189> slightly<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you need to move it just slightly to the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.960 
you need to move it just slightly to the
side<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.689> order<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.189> give<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> poi<00:01:44.579> enough

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
side in order to give the poi enough

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
side it winds up looking like this again

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.449 
side it winds up looking like this again
the<00:02:21.780> pieces<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.290> if<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.189> start<00:02:23.400> off

with the hand that's going to be closer
you're<00:02:25.349> gonna<00:02:25.470> find<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:26.010> essentially

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
you're gonna find that essentially

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.300 
you're gonna find that essentially

opposite shoulder to a certain degree

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.849 
opposite shoulder to a certain degree
right<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.709> we<00:02:31.859> still<00:02:32.129> have<00:02:32.310> our<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.510> know

over/under back movements in order to

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.580 
over/under back movements in order to
make<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.599> three<00:02:36.840> beat<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> working

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
make the three beat we have working

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.830 
make the three beat we have working
everything<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.510> once<00:02:39.510> you're<00:02:39.659> pretty

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
everything and once you're pretty

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
everything and once you're pretty
comfortable<00:02:39.989> with<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:40.920> start

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
comfortable with that you can start

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.339 
comfortable with that you can start
letting<00:02:41.549> out<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> poi<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.720> other<00:02:42.900> hand

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
letting out the poi in your other hand

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.080 
letting out the poi in your other hand
and<00:02:43.680> what<00:02:44.220> you're<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.519> find<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.060> that
