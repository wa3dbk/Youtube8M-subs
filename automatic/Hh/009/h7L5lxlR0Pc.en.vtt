portability<00:02:11.950> honestly<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.100> feels<00:02:13.310> exactly

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
portability honestly this feels exactly

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.100 
portability honestly this feels exactly

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
the same as the the the other mp5 as

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.330 
the same as the the the other mp5 as
well<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:21.230> will<00:02:22.100> get<00:02:22.310> yet<00:02:23.060> another<00:02:24.340> three

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
well so that will get yet another three

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.110 
well so that will get yet another three
out<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.030> five

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.030 

next<00:02:31.120> up<00:02:31.300> um<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:32.080> got<00:02:32.110> accuracy<00:02:32.740> um<00:02:35.040> accuracy

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
next up um we got accuracy um accuracy

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.160 
next up um we got accuracy um accuracy
on<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.520> gun<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.600> know<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.240> think<00:02:41.020> on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
on this gun you know I think I think on

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.650 
on this gun you know I think I think on
most<00:02:41.410> guns<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.520> silencer<00:02:43.060> kind<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.420> makes

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
most guns the the silencer kind of makes

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.170 
most guns the the silencer kind of makes
it<00:02:43.810> more<00:02:43.930> accurate<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.800> dumbs<00:02:45.400> down<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.910> power

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
it more accurate it dumbs down the power

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.630 
it more accurate it dumbs down the power
like<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.380> bit<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.160> does<00:02:48.310> make<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
like a little bit but it does make it a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.660 
like a little bit but it does make it a
little<00:02:48.670> more<00:02:48.850> accurate<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:51.160> which<00:02:51.430> case

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
little more accurate so in which case

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
little more accurate so in which case
you<00:02:51.940> know<00:02:52.060> I'd<00:02:52.210> have<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.480> give<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.780> accuracy

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you know I'd have to give the accuracy

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.350 
you know I'd have to give the accuracy
for<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.740> mp5<00:02:54.220> advanced<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:56.130> 4<00:02:57.130> out<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> 5<00:03:00.360> next

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
for the mp5 advanced a 4 out of 5 next

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.970 
for the mp5 advanced a 4 out of 5 next
up<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.190> rate<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> fire<00:03:04.500> right<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> fire<00:03:05.800> on

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
up is the rate of fire right a fire on

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.790 
up is the rate of fire right a fire on
this<00:03:06.160> gun<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.090> pretty<00:03:07.720> freakin<00:03:08.530> click

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
this gun this is a pretty freakin click

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.900 
this gun this is a pretty freakin click
on<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.220> guys<00:03:09.420> um<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:11.340> I'm<00:03:12.340> gonna<00:03:12.520> have<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.880> say

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
on you guys um so I'm gonna have to say

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.250 
on you guys um so I'm gonna have to say
this<00:03:13.420> gun<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.610> know<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.720> my

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
this gun you know I think it's in my

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.690 
this gun you know I think it's in my
opinion<00:03:17.590> faster<00:03:18.510> than<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:20.220> regular<00:03:21.220> mp5<00:03:22.440> so

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
opinion faster than the regular mp5 so

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.040 
opinion faster than the regular mp5 so
in<00:03:24.700> which<00:03:24.940> case<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.420> would<00:03:25.450> have<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.780> give<00:03:25.900> this

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
in which case I would have to give this

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.960 
in which case I would have to give this
gun<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:27.690> 4<00:03:28.690> out<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.440> 5<00:03:29.770> for<00:03:30.430> root<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.120> our<00:03:31.260> rate<00:03:32.260> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
gun a 4 out of 5 for root of our rate of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.530 
gun a 4 out of 5 for root of our rate of
fire

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.360 

the<00:03:37.540> ammo<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.110> actually<00:03:38.800> had<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> little

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the ammo I actually had to do a little

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.970 
the ammo I actually had to do a little
math<00:03:39.520> on<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.760> one<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.180> i<00:03:40.630> am<00:03:41.140> not<00:03:41.920> a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
math on this one because i am not a

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.890 
math on this one because i am not a
smart<00:03:42.520> kid<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:45.010> math<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.340> did<00:03:45.780> 40<00:03:46.780> out<00:03:46.870> of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
smart kid so the math I did 40 out of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.410 
smart kid so the math I did 40 out of
120<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.070> total<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:49.320> 160<00:03:50.320> bullets<00:03:50.650> and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
120 that is a total of 160 bullets and

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.420 
120 that is a total of 160 bullets and
30<00:03:52.420> out<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.930> 120<00:03:53.410> which<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> regular<00:03:54.040> mp5

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
30 out of 120 which is a regular mp5

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.360 
30 out of 120 which is a regular mp5
advanced<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:55.000> 150<00:03:55.810> bullets<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.350> has<00:03:56.530> 10

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
advanced is 150 bullets so this has 10

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.310 
advanced is 150 bullets so this has 10
more<00:03:57.670> bullets<00:03:58.090> giving<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.380> 4<00:03:59.680> out<00:03:59.710> of<00:03:59.830> 5<00:04:01.320> this

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
more bullets giving it a 4 out of 5 this

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.140 
more bullets giving it a 4 out of 5 this
is<00:04:02.760> going<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.820> be<00:04:03.970> an<00:04:04.150> 18<00:04:04.570> out<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.720> 25<00:04:05.520> when<00:04:06.520> you

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
is going to be an 18 out of 25 when you

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.740 
is going to be an 18 out of 25 when you
the<00:04:08.020> math<00:04:08.230> on<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.890> is<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.600> seventy<00:04:10.600> two

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
the math on that that is a seventy two

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.190 
the math on that that is a seventy two
percent<00:04:11.430> which<00:04:12.430> i<00:04:12.580> think<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:13.200> downgrading

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
percent which i think is downgrading

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.220
