00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
glass breaker down here at the end

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480 
glass breaker down here at the end
basically<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.979> standard<00:01:56.310> pen

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490

push the end and then you can have your
point<00:02:01.229> come<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.159> write

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
point come out so you can actually write

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600 
point come out so you can actually write
all<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.680> we're<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> try<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.130> pen<00:02:05.430> at

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
all right we're going to try this pen at

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.160 
all right we're going to try this pen at
a<00:02:05.640> variety<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.030> different<00:02:06.329> angles<00:02:06.450> first<00:02:06.930> just

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a variety of different angles first just

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.830 
a variety of different angles first just
on<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> flat<00:02:07.680> surface<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:10.640> this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
on a flat surface you can see this

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.830 
on a flat surface you can see this
works<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:13.209> fine<00:02:17.319> all<00:02:18.319> right<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:20.750> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
works just fine all right so there you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.210 
works just fine all right so there you
go<00:02:21.019> on<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:22.420> table

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
go on a table

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.680 
go on a table
okay<00:02:25.220> now<00:02:25.370> holding<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.819> notepad<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.480> up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
okay now holding this notepad here up

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.699 
okay now holding this notepad here up
against<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> wall

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
against the wall

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.710 
against the wall
so<00:02:27.950> we're<00:02:28.129> on<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.280> vertical<00:02:28.970> surface<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:29.569> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
so we're on a vertical surface here and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
so we're on a vertical surface here and
you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.739> see<00:02:30.920> again<00:02:34.209> bla<00:02:36.519> bla<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:40.459> also

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
completely vertically right now I'm

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.319 
completely vertically right now I'm
going<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.829> grab<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.160> pen<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.880> pad<00:02:50.090> and

see<00:03:10.209> once<00:03:10.420> again<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:12.420> works<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.280> know

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.399 
see once again that works now you know
as<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.730> started<00:03:16.120> looking<00:03:16.510> at<00:03:16.599> this<00:03:16.750> item<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.319> I

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
as I started looking at this item and I

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.839 
as I started looking at this item and I
was<00:03:17.530> thinking<00:03:17.650> about<00:03:17.890> actually<00:03:18.250> reviewing<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
was thinking about actually reviewing it

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.690 
was thinking about actually reviewing it
I<00:03:18.940> thought<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> myself<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.549> average

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
I thought to myself is the average

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.190 
I thought to myself is the average
person<00:03:22.030> going<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> spend<00:03:22.390> 50<00:03:22.720> or<00:03:22.750> 60<00:03:23.080> dollars

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
person going to spend 50 or 60 dollars

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.789 
person going to spend 50 or 60 dollars
