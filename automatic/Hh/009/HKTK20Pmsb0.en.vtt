also varnish the head of the screw and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.970 
also varnish the head of the screw and
you<00:00:08.580> will<00:00:08.760> go<00:00:08.910> back<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.570> your<00:00:10.170> surface<00:00:10.620> area

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
you will go back to your surface area

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.799 
you will go back to your surface area
and<00:00:11.099> actually<00:00:11.309> varnish<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> plugs<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and actually varnish the plugs at the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.530 
and actually varnish the plugs at the
same<00:00:13.049> time<00:00:13.400> now<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.460> won't<00:00:14.700> get<00:00:14.849> electrocuted

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
same time now you won't get electrocuted

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.029 
same time now you won't get electrocuted
because<00:00:15.839> you're<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> use<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.650> sponge

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
because you're going to use a sponge

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
because you're going to use a sponge
brush<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.789> you're<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> brush<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
brush and you're just going to brush the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.200 
brush and you're just going to brush the
surface<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> any<00:00:20.580> place<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> you've

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
surface of it any place that you've

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
surface of it any place that you've
painted<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.840> need<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> varnish<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> that's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
painted you need to varnish and that's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.839 
painted you need to varnish and that's
what<00:00:23.519> will<00:00:23.699> keep<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.180> paint<00:00:24.800> solid<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.010> if

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what will keep the paint solid and if

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
what will keep the paint solid and if
you<00:00:27.000> remember<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.930> varnish<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> water-based

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
you remember the varnish is water-based

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.319 
you remember the varnish is water-based
it<00:00:29.609> comes<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.300> gloss<00:00:30.679> satin<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.070> matte<00:00:32.329> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it comes in gloss satin and matte so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.360 
it comes in gloss satin and matte so
whatever<00:00:33.780> surface<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.440> doing<00:00:34.829> sometimes

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
whatever surface you're doing sometimes

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
whatever surface you're doing sometimes
you<00:00:35.550> might<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.300> leave<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.719> matte<00:00:36.960> if

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you might want to just leave it matte if

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.130 
you might want to just leave it matte if
it's<00:00:38.219> something<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> won't<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.180> water<00:00:39.780> use

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it's something that won't have water use

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
it's something that won't have water use
around<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> don't<00:00:40.829> even<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.460> varnish

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
around it you don't even have to varnish

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
around it you don't even have to varnish
it<00:00:42.050> granite<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> shiny<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> need<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it granite is shiny so you need the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.819 
it granite is shiny so you need the
gloss<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.180> you'll<00:00:45.690> need<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.989> least<00:00:46.020> three

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
gloss and you'll need at least three

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850 
gloss and you'll need at least three
coats<00:00:47.510> letting<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.600> dry<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:48.930> between<00:00:49.620> make

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
coats letting them dry in between make

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.660 
coats letting them dry in between make
sure<00:00:50.039> they're<00:00:50.219> completely<00:00:50.670> dry<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.449> then

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
sure they're completely dry and then

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.600 
sure they're completely dry and then
varnish<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.809> your<00:00:54.809> screw<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:56.280> plugs

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

varnish that your screw and your plugs
all<00:00:56.969> three<00:00:57.510> coats<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.340> it's<00:00:59.340> simple<00:00:59.789> enough

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
all three coats and it's simple enough

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
all three coats and it's simple enough
using<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.469> wax<00:01:01.710> paper<00:01:01.890> again<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:03.930> pour<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
using your wax paper again just pour it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
out take your sponge brush and you just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
out take your sponge brush and you just
brush<00:01:10.290> along<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:14.040> goes<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> little

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
brush along it actually goes on a little

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.810 
brush along it actually goes on a little
milky<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> dries<00:01:15.869> clear<00:01:16.280> try<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> make

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
milky but it dries clear try not to make

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
milky but it dries clear try not to make
bubbles<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.570> sponge<00:01:18.900> brush<00:01:19.200> tends<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> make

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
bubbles the sponge brush tends to make

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.310 
bubbles the sponge brush tends to make
the<00:01:20.070> bubbles<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> nice<00:01:21.840> big

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the bubbles but you get it nice big

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
the bubbles but you get it nice big
strokes<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.840> nice<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:27.229> just

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
strokes with it so it's nice to use just

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's not necessary just make sure you do
three<00:01:44.880> coats<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.680> edges<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.630> that
