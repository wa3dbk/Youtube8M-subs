there's also a stronghold right under

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
there's also a stronghold right under
spawn<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.199> well<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.160> under<00:01:02.430> spawn

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
spawn as well well not right under spawn

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
spawn as well well not right under spawn
but<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.210> close<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.660> there's<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.110> a

but it's really close so there's also a
abandoned<00:01:05.010> mineshaft<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:06.150> close<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
abandoned mineshaft really close to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
abandoned mineshaft really close to
spawn<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.430> stronghold<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
spawn as well but the stronghold is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
spawn as well but the stronghold is
actually<00:01:09.450> under<00:01:09.689> water<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.350> over

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
actually under water so it's right over

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.539 
actually under water so it's right over
here<00:01:10.590> check<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> out

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
here check this out

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
here check this out
so<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> stronghold<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.780> under

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so the stronghold is actually under

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
so the stronghold is actually under
water<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.619> doesn't<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> underwater

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
water but it doesn't have a underwater
entrance<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.509> over<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.799> it's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
entrance right over here so it's so it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070 
entrance right over here so it's so it's
really<00:01:17.130> simple<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> find<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.479> easy<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> get

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really simple to find really easy to get

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.260 
really simple to find really easy to get
into<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.430> doesn't<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> standard
