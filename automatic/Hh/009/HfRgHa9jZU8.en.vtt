00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.740
 Welcome to the first fire department around 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.110
 from ebony and me that means it's one 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.460
 video where he will now be suffering with us 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.860
 from the beginning to the end 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.529
 how experienced if you gladbach to 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.320
 cavallo k + s from the cuneiform cavallo 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.640
 that was a competition among the best 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.369
 ten have come 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.180
 under the theme of germany this is looking for 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.130
 environment 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.100
 so now is enough for a first 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.599
 stall so we just start this 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.550
 on the paddock I do not hope that you 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.480
 is to meet because the weather is something 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.680
 modest and then she would be in the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.120
 load trailer and drive off 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.379
 Now I have to find a horse first 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.670
 and as always, is in the middle 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:56.900
 with the butt to me 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.899
 we look again we see fit 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.940
 Going out clean for me you can 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.940
 directly thus simply perplexed 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.140
 nose-darting but the kreml 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.140
 path 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.119
 the methods with which he is everything you can 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.119
 take something with you 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.009
 from 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 Central hammer 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.650
 30 degrees in the shade 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 dust 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 Did you imagine that to me? 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.480
 wanted the 35 degrees 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.120
 but it's going well 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.879
 red still 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.160
 try 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.659
 from the brands
