you you expose a certain amount of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.970

yourself that the language is accessible
enough<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.110> flows<00:00:43.350> fairly

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
enough so that so that it flows fairly

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.959 
enough so that so that it flows fairly
easily<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.020> also<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.649> poet<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
easily you know I'm also a poet so I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.229 
easily you know I'm also a poet so I
have<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> tendency<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.920> poet<00:00:50.430> poeta<00:00:50.910> sighs

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
have a tendency to to poet poeta sighs

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
have a tendency to to poet poeta sighs
sometimes<00:00:51.680> but<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> never<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.789> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
sometimes but I never want it to be so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
sometimes but I never want it to be so
much<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.600> makes<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> reader<00:00:55.320> roll<00:00:55.620> their

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
much that it makes the reader roll their

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
much that it makes the reader roll their
eyes<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.489> feel<00:00:57.140> themselves<00:00:58.489> self-conscious

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
eyes and feel themselves self-conscious

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.279 
eyes and feel themselves self-conscious
which<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.359> probably<00:01:00.539> did<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
which I think I probably did do when I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
which I think I probably did do when I
was<00:01:01.500> younger<00:01:01.739> because<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
was younger because i was just so in

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
was younger because i was just so in
love<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.870> poetry<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.619> language

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
love with with poetry in with language

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.170 
love with with poetry in with language
but<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> ultimate<00:01:08.400> objective

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but there is this the ultimate objective

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.969 
but there is this the ultimate objective
i<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.320> sense<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
i think is to have a sense of this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.390 
i think is to have a sense of this
personal<00:01:11.520> relationship<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> reader

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
personal relationship to to the reader

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
personal relationship to to the reader
and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.820> also<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.140> bring<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.830> reader

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and then also to to to bring the reader

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300 
and then also to to to bring the reader
to<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.430> place<00:01:17.759> where<00:01:18.380> they<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.860> stem

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to a place where they put your stem

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
to a place where they put your stem
cells<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.939> shoes<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.540> they<00:01:21.630> wonder<00:01:21.960> okay

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cells in your shoes and they wonder okay

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
cells in your shoes and they wonder okay
what<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.830> done<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.700> my

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
what would I have done what would my

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
what would I have done what would my
responses<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:25.020> been<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.070> situation

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
responses have been to this situation

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
responses have been to this situation
again<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.390> way<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> works<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
again in that way it kind of works like

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.210 
again in that way it kind of works like
fiction<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> examine

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
fiction you know you you you you examine

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
fiction you know you you you you examine
this<00:01:32.340> world<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> lens<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> reading

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this world to the lens that is reading

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
this world to the lens that is reading
and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> turn<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> lens<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.420> your

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and then you turn that lens back on your

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.569 
and then you turn that lens back on your
own<00:01:36.720> life<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.770> okay<00:01:38.100> well<00:01:38.310> what

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
own life and you think okay well what

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
own life and you think okay well what
what<00:01:38.939> would<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.869> would<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.290> responses

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
what would I do what would my responses

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.090 
what would I do what would my responses
be<00:01:41.299> who<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.780> also<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> situation

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
be who would I also be in this situation

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
be who would I also be in this situation
but<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.500> really

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
but then you know that's that's really

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.240 
but then you know that's that's really
why<00:01:47.930> finally<00:01:48.930> why<00:01:49.170> literature<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.890> always

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
why finally why literature is always

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.030 
why finally why literature is always
more<00:01:50.990> engaging<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.530> intimate<00:01:53.009> than

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
more engaging and more intimate than

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.690 
more engaging and more intimate than
then<00:01:53.840> then<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.409> TV<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.100> movies

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
then then what we see on TV or in movies

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
then then what we see on TV or in movies
because<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.380> into<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
because it's if you go into that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.280 
because it's if you go into that
material<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.090> you're<00:02:00.210> reading<00:02:00.450> if

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
material if you're if you're reading if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
material if you're if you're reading if
you're<00:02:01.469> reading<00:02:01.619> well<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> suppose<00:02:02.460> we're

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you're reading well I suppose we're

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.429 
you're reading well I suppose we're
reading<00:02:02.969> deeply<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.689> material<00:02:04.140> kind<00:02:04.290> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
reading deeply that material kind of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.450 
reading deeply that material kind of
becomes<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.430> becomes<00:02:05.579> your<00:02:06.149> life
