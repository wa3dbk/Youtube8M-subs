 Rivers lonely mountain these gnomes 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.500
 intend to return their native land 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 I like guests like any hobbit 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420

 they will make very funny companies 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 so this is the hobbit you asked to find 14 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.600
 can pass unnoticed if needed what 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.420
 give us an advantage take advantage of this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.559
 a chance to return the meeting 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.110

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:05.900

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.240
 here is your goal to penetrate the mountain and what 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 such some will not 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.780
 too wise and dark forces have found a way 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:31.190
 back in the world why don't we play 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:41.420
 guessing game if baggins loses we 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:43.520
 see it entirely in my hands I would choose 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.820
 any of these dwarfs instead of the whole 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.820
 troops 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:56.080
 dedication and ardent heart 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.080
 I donâ€™t ask for more 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.799
 the house is already behind and the road ahead 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.820
 could be worse
