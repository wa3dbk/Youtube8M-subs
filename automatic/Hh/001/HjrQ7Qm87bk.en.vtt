even<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> roof<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.320> God's<00:00:22.500> sake<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
can but as far as I'm concerned is about

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
can but as far as I'm concerned is about
that<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> episode<00:01:11.010> where<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.220> take<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that time in the episode where we take a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
that time in the episode where we take a
look<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> Redstone<00:01:12.210> behind<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> let's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
look at the Redstone behind it so let's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.890 
look at the Redstone behind it so let's
head<00:01:13.590> around<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> back<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
head around the back now I think I can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
head around the back now I think I can
safely<00:01:16.170> say<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.430> most

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
safely say that this is one of the most

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
safely say that this is one of the most
complex<00:01:18.030> things<00:01:18.180> I've<00:01:18.450> ever<00:01:18.630> featured<00:01:19.320> on

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
complex things I've ever featured on

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
complex things I've ever featured on
this<00:01:19.650> channel<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.490> much<00:01:20.640> redstone

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this channel there is so much redstone

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
this channel there is so much redstone
there's<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:21.960> many<00:01:22.110> Pistons<00:01:22.590> firing<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:23.130> at

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there's so many Pistons firing all at

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
there's so many Pistons firing all at
once<00:01:23.460> blocks<00:01:23.790> whoppers<00:01:24.240> triple<00:01:24.930> piston

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
once blocks whoppers triple piston

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
once blocks whoppers triple piston
extenders<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.710> name<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:27.150> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
extenders you name it it's there it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
extenders you name it it's there it's
ridiculously<00:01:28.259> complex<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
ridiculously complex so much so that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
ridiculously complex so much so that
even<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.150> find<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.750> hard<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> understand<00:01:31.590> what's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
even I find it hard to understand what's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.010 
even I find it hard to understand what's
going<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
going on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.450 
going on
