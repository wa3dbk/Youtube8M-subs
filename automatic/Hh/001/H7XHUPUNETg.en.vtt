00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.530
 we have realized the experience of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.290
 parties without the sale of alcoholic beverage 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 mainly beer and other 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.240
 drinks 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.730
 we still have the sale of what then 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.279
 contains the alcoholic beverage is a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.010
 that we are implementing 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.109
 but the beer for example we no longer 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.449
 we sold more in the period I was a priest 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.180
 in paiÃ§andu then I noticed several 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 challenges with the board of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 and their families 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.660
 So many women came looking for me, right? 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
 during the week complaining about husbands 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.379
 because of the alcoholic beverage and we 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 we had a challenge we needed to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 money to do the pastoral actions 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 but also needed to preserve the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.000
 integrity of families 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 then faced with this challenge that people 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 took a stand, we will not sell 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.230
 alcoholic drink at church parties 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.219
 I like this phrase of demanding love nothing 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.559
 change if I change has lived this project 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.540
 in my life and communities for 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.080
 country I 've been through ten 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 years 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.610
 This began with the decision of the lay 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.030
 community 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.439
 also supported by cpp and we also 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.080
 is together 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.330
 this project to make the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.250
 families have quality of life 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.780
 then this decision not to sell 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.400
 alcoholic beverage has only benefited 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.950
 pastoral and economic decisions 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.799
 also from our parishes at the beginning 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 members of the ccp had several that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.040
 approve this idea, right? 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.509
 so after us after 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.750
 implanted we saw that in the first 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.729
 year the party's revenue remained but 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.530
 in the next few years she tends to have 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 increasing around 10 to 20 percent 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 we had less spending on security and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 less violence at parties and families 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.920
 began to participate more in the events 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.229
 of the parish the party had no less profit 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 than when he had alcohol 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.210
 It was difficult to convince them but it was a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 very furious experience a very 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.760
 that we perceive after the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.710
 ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.440
 the participation of families 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.950
 in the promotions parties because the family 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.950
 feel safe in bringing your children 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.400
 rear the children from wife wife 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.370
 Teens come to the party to know that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.050
 there a safe environment where they can 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.590
 remain and this has been a fruit 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.300
 very good for our community 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.730
 parish and we see the joy of the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.180
 wives' children to come 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.430
 exposed there too few from the beginning ne 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.680
 but they get together, they feel 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.570
 the need for alcoholic beverages and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.270
 I think it's a hypocrisy of ours. 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.520
 church is to have a party 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:00.030
 parish to collect values, not for 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.570
 keep our parish and pastoral and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.020
 movements on the other hand also maintain 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.930
 our support recovery homes 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.620
 to the work done with 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.910
 chemical addiction is getting this way 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.980
 hypocrisy 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.900
 on one side we come from drink 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.060
 on the other hand we have to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.630
 being in recovery houses 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.410
 then an evangelical decision for us 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.050
 for the whole church that only has the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.840
 to benefit the families who own it 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.760
 own testimony of the church is this 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.700
 decision that should not be by a decree 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.300
 but by the awareness of the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.970
 experience and invite you to do this 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.270
 experience in your community in the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.680
 I'm sure your parish 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.340
 will reap fruits and thus testimonies 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.340
 for our church
