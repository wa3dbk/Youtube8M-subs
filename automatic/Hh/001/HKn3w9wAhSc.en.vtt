to dig your fingernails in order to try

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.470 
to dig your fingernails in order to try
to<00:03:40.769> press<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.190> buttons<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.239> was<00:03:42.360> good

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
to press your buttons so that was good

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.759 
to press your buttons so that was good
to<00:03:42.600> see<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.140> press<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:43.620> but

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
to see that you can press in there but

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.410 
to see that you can press in there but
the<00:03:43.890> case<00:03:44.220> does<00:03:44.489> slightly<00:03:44.970> come<00:03:45.150> over<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the case does slightly come over the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.030 
the case does slightly come over the
buttons<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.650> protect<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
buttons so it is going to protect the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920 
buttons so it is going to protect the
buttons<00:03:47.280> if<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.459> do<00:03:47.579> happen<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.880> drop<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.269> just

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
buttons if you do happen to drop it just

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050 
buttons if you do happen to drop it just
like<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.320> top<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.799> fully<00:03:49.980> exposed<00:03:50.489> but<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
like the top it is fully exposed but the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.090 
like the top it is fully exposed but the
case<00:03:51.269> does<00:03:51.540> rise<00:03:51.780> over<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.230> top<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.920> that's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
case does rise over the top so that's

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.670 
case does rise over the top so that's
good<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.720> bottom<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.019> got<00:03:55.230> your<00:03:55.350> 30-pin
