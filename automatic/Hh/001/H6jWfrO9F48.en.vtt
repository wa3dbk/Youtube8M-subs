00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.530
 I do not know what's happening today. 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.270
 our ears 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.710
 but I think you today and I became 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.160
 you do not do that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.380
 understood but anyway everyone already does 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.199
 and today you did but you're good I 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.539
 I believe in you and I love your voice 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.009
 I trust you, are you sure? 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.250
 you can see if you will be back much better 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.259
 dj matheus already told you that I have one 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.080
 Wonderful team reminds me a lot. 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.880
 candidate who is from here since I finally 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.460
 I want to give you an expensive tip, do not worry 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.560
 worry about achieving what you are 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.520
 comfortable for you you have a team 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.940
 wonderful and it's exactly jp one thing 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.120
 cool is being a buried ditch 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.110
 the board has a beautiful voice this all 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.840
 world already knows 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.030
 I felt that it out of tune seems serious 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.820
 that I was asking to tone down 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.130
 doses and low half tone already solve if already 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.810
 stay at the hotel natural tone 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.220
 so I think I felt that I think 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.409
 perhaps without taking care of a little more than a 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.830
 good record to him or matheus master 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:42.889
 I understand something voice power is a 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.020
 Thing tuning is another 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.050
 You have one thing but you do not have to 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.080
 another you have not tuned enough along 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.880
 of the song not only of the more 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.590
 also in the great majority of stanzas is 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.740
 exactly if you do not know the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.229
 plural of refrain is our speech 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.169
 he only today they after all the other times 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:11.060
 it was not like that, it's not like that today was 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.639
 today was my mother is not the second 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.349
 time there is none of these are rules 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.029
 different grammatical then saw my 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.889
 friend then you have voice power but 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:23.710
 You did not sing fine tuned into that. 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.710
 Let's wait if these guys speak fifa.
