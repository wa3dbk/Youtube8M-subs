00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 You must have noticed that 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.980
 just before the responsible conversation 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.110
 or indoor performance becomes 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.810
 unbearably stuffy air ends 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.439
 I want to drink more water fan myself 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.420
 sweat appears on the forehead and 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.650
 here's a pair to talk about air at all 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.879
 you are choking 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.269
 what's the problem in the excitement is understandable but 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.100
 where the air is gone the air at the 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.500
 business remained but with the so-called 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.110
 public shock we start wrong 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 use and all because public 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.129
 shock causes adrenaline rush to the blood 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.890
 which in turn causes 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.260
 heart palpitations and accordingly 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.960
 the need to more actively saturate this 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.449
 pounding heart with oxygen and so we 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.939
 We begin to choke forever hard and here 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.299
 we are already talking to the floor area around 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:08.060
 own shoes so that it is not 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.369
 happening was important to learn to manage 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.560
 with our breath we are very responsible 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.229
 come to breathing when 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.340
 for example we play sports also here 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.650
 breath guarantee of confident sounding 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 speak we can only exhale and in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.530
 that it does not burn but that our exhalation was 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 voluminous and powerful we need something 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.090
 exercise with sighs and so before 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.530
 take three deep breaths 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.990
 every time for a minute holding your breath 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:45.680
 breathed detained so you 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.350
 suck blood with oxygen this is perry 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.290
 oxygenated blood goes to the brain 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.810
 and active oxygen attack acts 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.729
 on this brain as a powerful soothing 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.650
 means 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.080
 these three deep breath breaths 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.299
 similar to the glass of valerian taken 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.420
 before the performance besides what you 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.500
 reassured yourself you also included a larger 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 lung capacity 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.690
 that is, outpost 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.450
 for yourself breathe is not the top of the lungs 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.490
 and the bottom 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.500
 this air volume is enough for large 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.350
 speech segments on brilliant force 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.250
 sound while getting air into the lungs 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.950
 we will be just ribs right here 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.610
 no little sobs top 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.670
 In part, the more air in the lungs. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.510
 more power can be given a voice and power 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.580
 sounding 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.390
 this demonstration of inner strength 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.959
 speaking if exhaling tiny force 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.920
 sound tiny your performance 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:53.280
 tiny if exhale powerful sound village 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.280
 powerful your performance powerful
