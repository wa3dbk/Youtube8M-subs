00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.020
 so here we are dealing with expressions 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.300
 which are a little bit harder than 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
 the previous ones so always same day 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.070
 or sell calculate expressions 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.099
 following 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.350
 so we remember that priorities already 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 in parenthesis okay and in absence of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.279
 parenthesis priority to multiplication 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.910
 and division where you have a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.560
 combination of all and possibilities 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.660
 so you have to be very careful 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.310
 so for the first what 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.810
 I'm interested first of all is the parenthesis 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 because it's my priority 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.380
 but what do I get into my 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 parenthesis I notice that I have to do 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.809
 a sum is also division i see so 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 in my parenthesis my priority is the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.840
 division but I know I'm going 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.239
 start with my parenthesis 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 that means 56 will stay out of play 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.530
 but I never did I did not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.039
 d equal but actually the best if at each 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.030
 times to put equal when you take off 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:05.040
 line to line so here we will see 56 - 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 in parentheses since this is my 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.060
 priority and I do not forget to score 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.950
 the rest of the expression then your 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.070
 related I'm starting to division 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.680
 so in this parenthesis I mark 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 the rest, that is to say canal + and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.020
 now 63/7 it's September 9 x 7 smith 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 did 60 points of even agreement i 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 still a parenthesis so it's still 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.890
 my priority and I remain fifty six 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:40.040
 month the result of the red horse and the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.250
 stroke 15 + 9 it's twenty-four way 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:49.460
 legal 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.460
 the 56 - 24 it's 5 to 3 30th 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.590
 so here I have parentheses these are 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.689
 so my priorities after I look in 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.640
 the bombshell parlor linger budget heart 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.499
 and I just have a difference 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.299
 okay and in this parenthesis 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.580
 I have here a subtraction and the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.379
 multiplications in this case the thing by 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 multiplication in the parenthesis 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.879
 so I do not forget to start already 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.810
 by the parentheses by marking the rest 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.920
 of expression is becoming leucate 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.160
 more but no I take care of my 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.799
 parenthesis 23 25 - 3 it hurts play 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.099
 gave a result so that's 22 I 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:35.190
 do not forget this time of I have 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.959
 given a result of his young life here and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.370
 I will mark the expression pictures more 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.319
 same thing here i'm going to take care of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.620
 this parenthesis but I'm going to start 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.180
 by multiplication 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.849
 do not forget that these priorities maxi &amp; 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:59.549
 this time it's 36 I mark lola 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:01.139
 the expression - 27 cents next j 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.359
 parenthesis is my priority 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.389
 okay next here that is 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.900
 multiplication is so my priority I 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:14.579
 address me the expression so 4 + 22 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:21.299
 times to undermine 44 plus the result of 36 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:25.470
 - 27 his sentence 9 okay and then we 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:30.590
 gives the result 4 + 44 + 9 then 4 + 44 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.590
 saÃ¯fi 48 and 48 +9 that's 57 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.599
 so here we did not have any more but this 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.700
 will be a little longer we can say 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.739
 as a parenthesis I start at everything 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.540
 price by the parenthesis y young have 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.190
 this expression as it is no 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.810
 problem it works too because of 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.160
 Anyway after you will be busy you 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.380
 you will be busy with 22 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.510
 2 because it's a priority 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.190
 multiplication here here before thesis I 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.540
 first of all parenthesis and what is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.830
 what I regret in this parenthesis 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.930
 I have a subtraction and a 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.480
 multiplication so I start in 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.840
 this parenthesis by checking 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.860
 dance the course 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.650
 I 'm going to have 29 me since I have to 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.170
 do this time 3.21 and I mate it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.519
 remains divided by four there is I 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.220
 still take care of the kin because 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.650
 that he is still 29 - 21 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.050
 that's 8 I'm more obliged to medog 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.970
 is a parenthesis and I do not live 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.370
 mark their ease of expression / the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.770
 framework and finally 8/4 in a cafe 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.930
 same thing here 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.670
 parenthesis is my priority but we 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.960
 can also deal here the habit is 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.360
 sure that it is also a priority 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.860
 in front they wanted your expression 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.570
 is divided in two you have this 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.250
 part of the phrase you occupied 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.930
 of multiplication you name these 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.480
 two parts of the expression you have the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.510
 parenthesis and it has priority 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.030
 okay but the place that is maybe 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.160
 to avoid getting confused 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.280
 we start as is by parenthesis 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.250
 that is, I scored 5 + 2 times 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.100
 May 17 about May 1 617 kubel of 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:13.010
 voice 17 to six months in brackets 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:17.270
 I take care of that at 18/9 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:20.910
 we can write it starts this way 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.330
 more toulouse and where you see that 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.580
 in this parenthesis I do not start the 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.470
 division 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:34.800
 in this case I had to have 5 + 2 x 10 5 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.220
 - in parentheses 18/9 it is 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.320
 priority in this case that's two 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.580
 the rest I do not say anymore 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.550
 fresh 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.230
 I still have my parenthesis faster and 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:51.600
 so 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:54.060
 twice 17 - 14 since as I have 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.220
 given the sum here pay more need of 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.250
 parenthesis but no I have an expression 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.380
 that there is no more deiz I start 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.850
 here by multiplication in this 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:13.500
 that she will give me 5 + 2 times 17 the 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:16.380
 peace 34 - 14 and there we will project as 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.070
 we want to know that it's better to 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.970
 maybe do 34 points 14 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.520
 okay it's like you have cure and 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.170
 sum and we could say that we had said that 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.760
 in the short the best is to do 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.880
 calculations the left of the right 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.280
 okay but you saw that in 6th in 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.730
 waiting for his 6th painted directly that 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.090
 before because 34 14 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.380
 how much is that's twenty then it's 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.620
 easier has not been added to 5 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.540
 hugo of tests 5 + 34 and -14 to that it me 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.500
 seems even unit so it's easier 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.930
 and to subtract them 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.460
 in which case it never told me 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:58.160
 what 20 25 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:07:00.900
 yes but here's how I say it here 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.210
 we can also take care of both the 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.580
 parenthesis because it's my priority 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.130
 okay but we can also look after 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.300
 both of the multiplication 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.090
 okay because I mean by that 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.640
 when I take care of the parenthesis it is 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.610
 especially for this example it's for 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.970
 to prevent me from doing no will resume his 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.970
 walk for 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:32.460
 no no I did not get any confused 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:34.080
 so here I take care first then I 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.700
 want to take care of this parenthesis I 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.690
 can I take care of this waiting to be so 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.380
 you see that the expression is 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.720
 divided in two 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.980
 I have this part of expression and I 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.310
 this part of expression not there it's 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.140
 the same 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.090
 I have this part of the expression is 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.860
 always separated on one thing a 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.330
 difference and I have this part 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.800
 of expression that's why it takes 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.130
 take care of two things at the same time 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.260
 same time 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.150
 except that in this example I have 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.760
 busy that from the parenthesis I could have 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.470
 also busy 2 x 10 7 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.600
 but it does not change anything if 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.000
 you did 2 times 17 before and 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.860
 then if you are busy with the 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.950
 parenthesis the goal is to do the same 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.950
 time
