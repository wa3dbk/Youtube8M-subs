00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.559 
do is enter in the specific code in the
inspector<00:03:47.290> element<00:03:47.680> page<00:03:47.829> you'll<00:03:48.159> see

fluorescent<00:03:49.569> blue<00:03:49.720> kind<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:50.199> looks<00:03:50.439> like<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
fluorescent blue kind of looks like it

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.710 
fluorescent blue kind of looks like it
teal<00:03:51.759> ish<00:03:52.090> but<00:03:52.509> it's<00:03:53.259> close<00:03:53.979> but<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.720> didn't

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
teal ish but it's close but I didn't

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.929 
teal ish but it's close but I didn't
think<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.959> looks<00:03:56.169> better<00:03:56.259> it<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:57.250> pops<00:03:57.609> more

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
think it looks better it just pops more

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.819 
think it looks better it just pops more
and<00:03:58.090> stands<00:03:58.389> out<00:03:58.629> more<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.379> a<00:03:59.620> lot<00:03:59.650> more

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
and stands out more I like it a lot more

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.300 
and stands out more I like it a lot more
so<00:04:00.639> that's<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.000> fluorescent<00:04:01.629> blue<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:02.189> then<00:04:03.189> in

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
so that's the fluorescent blue I then in

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.129 
so that's the fluorescent blue I then in
order<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.669> get<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.060> kill<00:04:04.329> on<00:04:04.509> blue<00:04:04.750> while<00:04:04.989> you

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
order to get the kill on blue while you

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.679

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
just need to enter in the specific

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.050 
just need to enter in the specific
coding<00:04:07.959> again<00:04:08.469> and<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.040> inspector<00:04:09.280> elements

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
coding again and the inspector elements

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.909 
coding again and the inspector elements
and<00:04:10.239> as<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.539> can<00:04:10.659> see<00:04:10.689> it's<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.139> bit<00:04:11.289> more<00:04:11.530> pale

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
and as you can see it's a bit more pale

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.920 
and as you can see it's a bit more pale
blue<00:04:12.280> but<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:13.000> does<00:04:13.180> look<00:04:13.209> pretty<00:04:13.629> sweet

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930
