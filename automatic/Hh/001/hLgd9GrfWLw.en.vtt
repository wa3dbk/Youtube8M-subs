00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
because so heavy let's see if we can get

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.070 
because so heavy let's see if we can get
some<00:03:26.470> top<00:03:26.800> end<00:03:27.100> out<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.370> them<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.810> next

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
some top end out of them on this next

run<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:30.880> going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.150> take<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.390> loop<00:03:31.630> around<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
run I'm going to take a loop around the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.300 
run I'm going to take a loop around the
neighborhood<00:03:32.530> use<00:03:32.740> a<00:03:32.770> motor<00:03:33.430> with<00:03:33.700> stone<00:03:33.940> cold

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
neighborhood use a motor with stone cold

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.480

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
so he's probably up in the 30 range we

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.839 
so he's probably up in the 30 range we
headed<00:03:50.900> up<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.140> 35<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:53.780> brand<00:03:54.050> new

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
know how fast he got it up on that run

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.980 
know how fast he got it up on that run
but

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990
