00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.860 
that off to one side and have a look at
the<00:00:56.080> case<00:00:56.260> itself<00:00:56.880> really<00:00:57.880> very<00:00:58.270> very<00:00:58.600> nice

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
the case itself really very very nice

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.500 
the case itself really very very nice
and<00:00:59.260> this<00:01:00.100> is<00:01:00.250> sort<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.490> two<00:01:00.730> piece<00:01:00.970> case<00:01:01.270> you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and this is sort of two piece case you

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.090 
and this is sort of two piece case you
can<00:01:01.660> remove<00:01:01.930> this<00:01:02.140> sort<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.410> harder<00:01:02.860> plastic

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100

outer piece and pop this to one side and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.190 
outer piece and pop this to one side and
then<00:01:06.430> we've<00:01:06.550> got<00:01:06.730> this<00:01:06.880> pliable<00:01:07.420> sort<00:01:08.140> of

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
then we've got this pliable sort of

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.260 
then we've got this pliable sort of
silicon<00:01:08.740> inner<00:01:08.980> and<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.640> has<00:01:09.790> got<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:09.970> pattern

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
silicon inner and this has got a pattern

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.320 
silicon inner and this has got a pattern
on<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.780> inside<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:12.100> some<00:01:12.670> people<00:01:12.820> think<00:01:13.120> this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
on the inside now some people think this

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
on the inside now some people think this
is<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.600> because<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.140> cosmetic<00:01:14.740> use<00:01:14.980> but<00:01:15.310> it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
is just because of cosmetic use but it

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.550 
is just because of cosmetic use but it
actually<00:01:15.850> aids<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:17.050> sort<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.409> heat

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
actually aids in sort of heat

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.140 
actually aids in sort of heat
dissipation<00:01:17.710> as<00:01:18.340> well<00:01:18.490> because<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.790> raises

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
dissipation as well because it raises

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.270 
dissipation as well because it raises
the<00:01:19.270> back<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.540> your<00:01:19.690> iPhone<00:01:20.080> off<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.770> back<00:01:21.159> of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
the back of your iPhone off the back of

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.460 
the back of your iPhone off the back of
the<00:01:21.340> case<00:01:21.520> very<00:01:21.820> very<00:01:22.120> slightly<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:23.200> can<00:01:23.320> see

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
the case very very slightly we can see

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.350 
the case very very slightly we can see
it's<00:01:23.620> an<00:01:23.710> original<00:01:23.979> authentic<00:01:24.640> product<00:01:25.210> layer

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
it's an original authentic product layer

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's an original authentic product layer
as<00:01:25.510> well<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.960> fit<00:01:26.740> in<00:01:26.860> your<00:01:26.979> iPhone<00:01:27.340> in<00:01:27.490> very

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
as well and fit in your iPhone in very

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.250 
as well and fit in your iPhone in very
very<00:01:28.060> easy<00:01:28.360> we're<00:01:28.540> going<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.720> go<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:28.900> top<00:01:29.110> edge

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
very easy we're going to go in top edge

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.670 
very easy we're going to go in top edge
first<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:31.450> ease<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:32.110> round<00:01:32.380> like

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
first and then just ease it round like

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.910 
first and then just ease it round like
so<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:34.180> it's<00:01:34.299> now<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.900> silicon<00:01:35.380> outer<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
so so it's now in that silicon outer and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.890 
so so it's now in that silicon outer and
then<00:01:36.460> we<00:01:36.549> can<00:01:36.700> just<00:01:36.850> place<00:01:37.060> this<00:01:37.299> on<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> back

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
then we can just place this on the back

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.830 
then we can just place this on the back
and<00:01:38.280> clip<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:39.430> into<00:01:39.580> place<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.240> it's<00:01:40.690> as

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
and clip it into place and it's as

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.410 
and clip it into place and it's as
simple<00:01:40.870> as<00:01:41.940> that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
simple as that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.940 
simple as that
it's<00:01:43.630> just<00:01:43.810> everything<00:01:44.229> lined<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:44.740> properly

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
it's just everything lined up properly

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.690 
it's just everything lined up properly
on<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.820> back<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.440> go<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.520> is

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
on the back and there we go so this is

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.490 
on the back and there we go so this is
it<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.330> tough<00:01:49.600> Armour<00:01:49.990> case<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
it this is the tough Armour case and

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.620 
it this is the tough Armour case and
we've<00:01:50.890> got<00:01:51.010> this<00:01:51.159> air<00:01:51.369> cushion<00:01:51.850> technology<00:01:52.060> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
we've got this air cushion technology in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.630 
we've got this air cushion technology in
here<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.409> this<00:01:53.560> gives<00:01:53.799> some<00:01:53.979> really<00:01:54.040> good

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
here so this gives some really good

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.120 
here so this gives some really good
impact<00:01:55.180> resistance<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:56.320> all<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> edges<00:01:57.100> of

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
impact resistance to all of the edges of

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100 
impact resistance to all of the edges of
your<00:01:57.280> device<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:58.360> still<00:01:58.630> hasn't<00:01:58.900> quite

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
your device this still hasn't quite

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.730 
your device this still hasn't quite
clipped<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.680> properly<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:02.110> just<00:02:02.320> push<00:02:02.560> this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
clipped in properly let's just push this

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.109 
clipped in properly let's just push this
in<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.040> little<00:02:03.280> bit<00:02:03.369> more<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:05.040> there<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.220> go<00:02:06.400> is

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
in a little bit more and there we go is

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.520 
in a little bit more and there we go is
that<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.479> there

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
that in there

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.480 
that in there
maybe<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.680> should<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.070> read<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
maybe I should have read the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.460 
maybe I should have read the
instructions<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.330> how<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> install<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.290> case

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
instructions on how to install the case

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.640 
instructions on how to install the case
but<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.490> go<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.270> now<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.200> let's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
but there we go that's in now so let's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.290 
but there we go that's in now so let's
have<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.800> little<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.250> around<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.880> case<00:02:18.060> away

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
have a little look around the case away

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.880 
have a little look around the case away
so<00:02:19.020> bottom<00:02:19.470> edge

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
so bottom edge

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.430 
so bottom edge
we've<00:02:20.070> got<00:02:20.310> cutouts<00:02:20.760> here<00:02:21.290> for<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
we've got cutouts here for the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.160 
we've got cutouts here for the
microphone<00:02:22.890> speaker<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.910> Lightning<00:02:24.360> charge

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
microphone speaker the Lightning charge

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
microphone speaker the Lightning charge
connector<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.040> also<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> three-and-a-half

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.810 
connector and also the three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:02:27.570> audio<00:02:27.960> jack<00:02:28.260> really<00:02:29.160> nicely<00:02:29.400> cut

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
millimeter audio jack really nicely cut

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.540 
millimeter audio jack really nicely cut
out<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.150> well<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.890> then<00:02:31.890> across<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.340> edge

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
out as well and then across this edge

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.510 
out as well and then across this edge
here<00:02:32.820> completely<00:02:33.420> clear<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.250> then<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> top

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
here completely clear and then the top

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.010 
here completely clear and then the top
edge<00:02:35.700> we've<00:02:36.000> got<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.180> integrated<00:02:36.810> power

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
edge we've got an integrated power

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.080 
edge we've got an integrated power
button<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.650> we'll<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.250> testing<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.940> see

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
button and we'll be testing that to see

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.540 
button and we'll be testing that to see
how<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.330> works<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> short<00:02:40.200> while<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.620> then

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
how that works in a short while and then

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.580 
how that works in a short while and then
run<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.030> edge<00:02:42.240> here<00:02:42.270> we've<00:02:43.050> got<00:02:43.140> cut<00:02:43.410> out

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
run on this edge here we've got cut out

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
run on this edge here we've got cut out
there<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> lock<00:02:44.400> silence<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.060> switch<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
there for the lock silence to switch and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.630 
there for the lock silence to switch and
we've<00:02:46.050> also<00:02:46.170> got<00:02:46.410> integrated<00:02:46.709> volume<00:02:47.340> up<00:02:47.459> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
we've also got integrated volume up and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.790 
we've also got integrated volume up and
down<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.600> back<00:02:48.930> something<00:02:49.260> that's<00:02:49.500> really

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
down on the back something that's really

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.170 
down on the back something that's really
nice<00:02:49.920> for<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.280> case<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.730> we've<00:02:50.880> got<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> nice

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
nice for this case is we've got a nice

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.090 
nice for this case is we've got a nice
large<00:02:51.450> cutout<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.260> still<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> Apple

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
large cutout you can still see the Apple

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.860 
large cutout you can still see the Apple
logo<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.150> we've<00:02:54.240> got<00:02:54.330> another<00:02:54.390> cutout

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
logo and then we've got another cutout

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.630 
logo and then we've got another cutout
up<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> top<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> camera<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
up the top for the camera of the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.690 
up the top for the camera of the
microphone<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.570> flash<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> let's<00:02:59.520> see

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
microphone and the flash so let's see

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400 
microphone and the flash so let's see
how<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.150> works<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.870> power<00:03:01.140> button

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
how this actually works the power button

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.790 
how this actually works the power button
at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> top<00:03:02.540> no<00:03:03.540> extra<00:03:03.930> effort<00:03:03.959> needed<00:03:04.350> at<00:03:04.590> all

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
at the top no extra effort needed at all

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.670 
at the top no extra effort needed at all
and<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:06.180> works<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:06.990> well<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:07.590> we

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and that works really well and then we

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.380 
and that works really well and then we
also<00:03:07.830> got<00:03:08.070> these<00:03:08.190> integrated<00:03:08.640> volume<00:03:09.120> up<00:03:09.240> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
also got these integrated volume up and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.670 
also got these integrated volume up and
down<00:03:09.420> buttons<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.020> let's<00:03:10.170> see<00:03:10.320> how<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:10.650> work

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
down buttons so let's see how they work

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.190 
down buttons so let's see how they work
and<00:03:12.500> again<00:03:13.790> perfectly<00:03:14.790> positioned<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.540> no

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and again perfectly positioned and no

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.530 
and again perfectly positioned and no
extra<00:03:16.680> effort<00:03:16.709> needed<00:03:17.160> at<00:03:17.340> all<00:03:17.580> for<00:03:18.150> operating

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
extra effort needed at all for operating

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.560 
extra effort needed at all for operating
those<00:03:18.810> volume<00:03:19.230> controls<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> side<00:03:20.570> very

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
those volume controls on the side very

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.660 
those volume controls on the side very
very<00:03:21.930> nice<00:03:22.170> looking<00:03:22.410> case<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.550> what
