00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you can turn these over shape up here

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.090 
you can turn these over shape up here
make<00:01:13.050> these<00:01:13.260> who<00:01:13.410> would<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.070> your

make these who would use that as your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
make these who would use that as your
chemin<00:01:14.610> let<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.300> show<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.480> how<00:01:15.600> magnesium

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
chemin let me show you how magnesium

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
chemin let me show you how magnesium
works<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.910> metal<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.390> for

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
works this is the metal they use for

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
works this is the metal they use for
underwater<00:01:18.900> welding<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.440> submarines<00:01:19.950> ships

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
underwater welding on submarines ships

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.230 
underwater welding on submarines ships
and<00:01:20.610> oil<00:01:20.700> rigs

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and oil rigs

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
and oil rigs
so<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.140> map<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> gets<00:01:22.620> wet<00:01:22.830> once<00:01:23.100> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so that's your map it gets wet once it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.820 
so that's your map it gets wet once it's
burning<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:23.880> some<00:01:24.210> wood<00:01:24.360> burn<00:01:24.540> underwater

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
burning maybe some wood burn underwater

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
burning maybe some wood burn underwater
it<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.010> burns<00:01:26.280> over<00:01:26.520> 5,000<00:01:27.300> degrees<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it also burns over 5,000 degrees so it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.360 
it also burns over 5,000 degrees so it's
like<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.740> heat<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.160> with

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
like you get a lot of heat to work with

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.460 
like you get a lot of heat to work with
you<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.730> burns<00:01:29.880> quiet<00:01:30.180> fine<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.230> want

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you see it burns quiet fine now you want

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
you see it burns quiet fine now you want
to<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.620> a<00:01:31.650> file<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.310> size<00:01:32.550> of<00:01:32.700> a

quarter to start with and once you Flint

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.060 
quarter to start with and once you Flint
into<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:37.230> metal<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.620> start<00:01:37.890> burning

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
into that that metal will start burning

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.790 
into that that metal will start burning
