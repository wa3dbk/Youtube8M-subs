00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
today by my friend Don Richardson the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.709 
today by my friend Don Richardson the
final<00:00:56.640> technique<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.210> gonna<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.510> over

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
final technique that we're gonna go over

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.430 
final technique that we're gonna go over
is<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> open<00:00:58.530> hi-hat<00:00:58.739> technique<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.440> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is the open hi-hat technique and just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.959 
is the open hi-hat technique and just
like<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.800> sounds<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> open

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
like it sounds like it's when you open

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
like it sounds like it's when you open
hi-hat<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> far<00:01:04.379> we've<00:01:04.530> had<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> closed<00:01:04.949> hi-hat

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hi-hat so far we've had a closed hi-hat

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490 
hi-hat so far we've had a closed hi-hat
and<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.180> example<00:01:06.510> jumper<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> last

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and in that example jumper from the last

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
and in that example jumper from the last
lesson<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.950> use<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> ride<00:01:08.490> cymbal

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
lesson we use the ride cymbal

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
lesson we use the ride cymbal
but<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> Hyatt<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.380> more<00:01:10.950> than<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
but the Hyatt can make more than just

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
but the Hyatt can make more than just
the<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.520> sound<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:18.710> some<00:01:19.710> grooves<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> want

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the one sound in some grooves you want

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.560 
the one sound in some grooves you want
to<00:01:20.369> open<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.670> hi-hat<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> little<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
to open the hi-hat only a little bit and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.679 
to open the hi-hat only a little bit and
in<00:01:24.570> others<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.869> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> open<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.799> lot

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
in others you want to open it up a lot

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.840

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.050 

and<00:02:44.350> at<00:02:44.500> first<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.920> beat<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.370> sound<00:02:45.670> kind<00:02:45.970> of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
and at first this beat can sound kind of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.910 
and at first this beat can sound kind of
difficult<00:02:46.750> because<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.140> opening<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.800> all

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
difficult because it's opening on all

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.130 
difficult because it's opening on all
the<00:02:48.040> ends<00:02:48.460> but<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> wouldn't<00:02:49.480> think<00:02:49.540> about<00:02:49.720> when

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the ends but I wouldn't think about when
