lot of guys ask us how do you work your
forearms<00:05:00.900> sometimes<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.020> best<00:05:02.230> thing<00:05:02.440> is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
forearms sometimes the best thing is

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.060 
forearms sometimes the best thing is
just<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.770> go<00:05:02.920> heavy<00:05:03.160> on<00:05:03.250> some<00:05:03.550> bigger<00:05:03.730> muscles

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
just to go heavy on some bigger muscles

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.230 
just to go heavy on some bigger muscles
integrate<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.220> forearm<00:05:06.610> into<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.940> actual

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
integrate the forearm into the actual

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.690 
integrate the forearm into the actual
exercise<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.260> isolating<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:08.980> but<00:05:09.550> his

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
exercise is that isolating it but his

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.520 
exercise is that isolating it but his
grip<00:05:09.940> has<00:05:10.090> got<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.330> be<00:05:10.360> pretty<00:05:10.570> darn<00:05:10.840> strong<00:05:11.260> to

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
grip has got to be pretty darn strong to

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.270 
grip has got to be pretty darn strong to
keep<00:05:11.680> up<00:05:11.860> with<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.100> tricep<00:05:12.340> there<00:05:12.790> so<00:05:14.280> every

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
keep up with the tricep there so every

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.770 
keep up with the tricep there so every
year<00:05:15.690> looks<00:05:16.690> good<00:05:20.940> notice<00:05:21.940> how<00:05:22.090> Zabul<00:05:22.570> is<00:05:22.630> not

those look really good those are way

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.140 
those look really good those are way
more<00:06:36.900> challenging<00:06:37.620> than<00:06:37.650> they<00:06:37.860> look<00:06:38.150> he's

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
more challenging than they look he's

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.570 
more challenging than they look he's
making<00:06:39.510> them<00:06:39.660> look<00:06:39.780> real<00:06:40.020> easy<00:06:40.290> right<00:06:40.590> now<00:06:40.620> but

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
making them look real easy right now but

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.580 
making them look real easy right now but
it's<00:06:41.700> really<00:06:41.910> work<00:06:42.180> everything<00:06:42.690> that's<00:06:43.350> good

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
it's really work everything that's good

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.010 
it's really work everything that's good
awesome<00:06:44.310> so<00:06:44.790> that's<00:06:44.910> like<00:06:45.000> one<00:06:45.210> set<00:06:45.510> so<00:06:45.780> Leah

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
awesome so that's like one set so Leah

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.260 
awesome so that's like one set so Leah
he's<00:06:46.860> going<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.100> go<00:06:47.220> through<00:06:47.520> that<00:06:47.550> three<00:06:48.120> more

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
he's going to go through that three more

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.060 
he's going to go through that three more
times<00:06:48.330> we're<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.080> increase<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.650> weights<00:06:49.860> on

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
times we're to increase the weights on

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.990 
times we're to increase the weights on
each<00:06:50.100> set<00:06:50.490> 12<00:06:51.360> 10<00:06:51.660> 8<00:06:51.690> 6<00:06:52.080> reps<00:06:52.260> item<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:53.000> he's

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
each set 12 10 8 6 reps item and he's

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.300 
each set 12 10 8 6 reps item and he's
just<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.300> go<00:06:54.420> heavier<00:06:54.750> right<00:06:54.900> it<00:06:55.260> is<00:06:55.470> now<00:06:56.130> with

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
just to go heavier right it is now with

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.400 
just to go heavier right it is now with
the<00:06:56.490> leg<00:06:56.820> raises<00:06:57.240> obviously<00:06:58.050> we're<00:06:58.200> not<00:06:58.260> going

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
the leg raises obviously we're not going

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.230 
the leg raises obviously we're not going
to<00:06:58.470> crease<00:06:58.620> the<00:06:58.740> weight<00:06:58.890> but<00:06:59.580> it<00:06:59.910> just<00:07:00.060> gets

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
to crease the weight but it just gets

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.430 
to crease the weight but it just gets
more<00:07:00.360> challenging<00:07:00.420> to<00:07:00.960> the<00:07:01.080> muscle<00:07:01.350> fatigue

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
more challenging to the muscle fatigue
