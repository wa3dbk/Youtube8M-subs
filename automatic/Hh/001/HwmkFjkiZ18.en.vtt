and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.130 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
apply<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:21.390> zurna<00:00:21.630> FG<00:00:22.199> 400<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.749> this<00:00:24.749> is<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
apply some in zurna FG 400 and this is a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
apply some in zurna FG 400 and this is a
very<00:00:25.349> aggressive<00:00:26.119> compound<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.539> tell

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
very aggressive compound as you can tell

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.050 
very aggressive compound as you can tell
from<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.140> scale<00:00:28.589> right<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.880> we're

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
from the scale right here and we're

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
from the scale right here and we're
gonna<00:00:30.150> use<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.869> apply<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> paint

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
gonna use that and apply it to the paint

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.240 
gonna use that and apply it to the paint
and<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.880> happens<00:00:39.110> now<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.890> apply<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and see what happens now if I apply this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.380 
and see what happens now if I apply this
very<00:00:41.610> white<00:00:41.880> need<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.240> paint<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:44.000> should<00:00:45.000> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
very white need to paint here should be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.640 
very white need to paint here should be
very<00:00:45.690> easy<00:00:45.900> to<00:00:46.170> remove

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
very easy to remove

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
very easy to remove
let's<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.700> set<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.270> speed

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.479 

point<00:00:59.269> of<00:00:59.359> this<00:00:59.420> demonstration<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.260> see<00:01:00.559> if

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
point of this demonstration is to see if

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.980 
point of this demonstration is to see if
I<00:01:01.879> put<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:05.330> immense<00:01:05.600> earner<00:01:05.720> right

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
I put on the the immense earner right

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.310 
I put on the the immense earner right
now<00:01:06.140> quickly<00:01:07.330> does<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.570> pause<00:01:08.810> wipe<00:01:09.110> off

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
now quickly does the pause wipe off

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.190 
now quickly does the pause wipe off
easily<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:12.740> does<00:01:13.659> not<00:01:14.659> too<00:01:14.869> much<00:01:15.020> effort

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
easily and it does not too much effort

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.830 
easily and it does not too much effort
it<00:01:15.860> wipes<00:01:16.070> off<00:01:18.220> now<00:01:19.220> what<00:01:20.180> this<00:01:20.299> is<00:01:20.360> showing<00:01:20.479> me

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
it wipes off now what this is showing me

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.770 
it wipes off now what this is showing me
is<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:22.430> wipes<00:01:22.640> off<00:01:22.880> fairly<00:01:23.479> easily

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
is that it wipes off fairly easily

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.010 
is that it wipes off fairly easily
because<00:01:24.080> I'm<00:01:24.979> still<00:01:25.310> on<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.180> Octagon<00:01:26.630> coating

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
because I'm still on the Octagon coating

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.929 
because I'm still on the Octagon coating
I<00:01:27.200> haven't<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.979> remove<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.460> coating<00:01:28.670> yet

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
I haven't to remove the coating yet

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.180 
I haven't to remove the coating yet
because<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.840> know<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.200> working<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:30.740> Subaru

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
because I know that working on Subaru

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.960 
because I know that working on Subaru
paint<00:01:31.490> that<00:01:32.179> if<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.990> had<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.920> polish<00:01:34.310> directly

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
paint that if I had the polish directly

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.779 
paint that if I had the polish directly
on<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.420> paint<00:01:36.159> paint<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.340> get<00:01:37.490> sticky

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
on the paint paint we get sticky

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.719 
on the paint paint we get sticky
compound<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.929> stick<00:01:39.200> there<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.710> be<00:01:39.890> actually

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
compound to stick there and be actually

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.309 
compound to stick there and be actually
quite<00:01:41.240> difficult<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.690> remove

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
quite difficult to remove

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.620 
quite difficult to remove
so<00:01:42.979> because<00:01:43.789> we<00:01:43.909> need<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.179> actually<00:01:44.330> remove

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so because we need to actually remove

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.529 
so because we need to actually remove
the<00:01:45.200> compound<00:01:45.909> we're<00:01:46.909> actually<00:01:47.090> gonna<00:01:47.330> use

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
the compound we're actually gonna use

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.669 
the compound we're actually gonna use
something<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.869> little<00:01:48.020> bit<00:01:48.110> more<00:01:48.229> aggressive

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
something a little bit more aggressive

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.830 
something a little bit more aggressive
than<00:01:49.069> a<00:01:49.100> black<00:01:49.340> pad<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:50.179> use<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> microfiber

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
than a black pad you use a microfiber

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.919 
than a black pad you use a microfiber
pad<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.549> moving<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.759> use<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.299> break

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
pad and moving it to use it to break

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.559 
pad and moving it to use it to break
through<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.560> optic<00:01:55.280> art<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.360> they'll

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
through the optic art and then they'll

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:58.930 
through the optic art and then they'll
show<00:01:57.319> you<00:01:57.380> how<00:01:57.770> easy<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.580> how<00:01:58.700> difficult

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
show you how easy it is or how difficult

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.539 
show you how easy it is or how difficult
it<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.590> remove<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> compound<00:02:01.190> from<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
it is to remove the compound from the

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.550 
it is to remove the compound from the
paint<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:02.240> let's<00:02:02.390> go<00:02:02.509> try<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.719> out<00:02:02.899> right<00:02:03.079> now

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
paint so let's go try that out right now

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.340 
paint so let's go try that out right now
all<00:02:04.460> right<00:02:04.579> I've<00:02:05.479> put<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.840> microfiber<00:02:06.200> pad

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
all right I've put on the microfiber pad

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.180 
all right I've put on the microfiber pad
onto<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:07.340> big<00:02:07.520> foot<00:02:07.670> 15<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.359> I<00:02:09.200> know<00:02:09.769> this<00:02:10.039> is

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
onto the big foot 15 and I know this is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.039 
onto the big foot 15 and I know this is
gonna<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.820> very<00:02:11.150> aggressive<00:02:11.540> combination

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
gonna be a very aggressive combination

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.479 
gonna be a very aggressive combination
actually<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.410> finishing<00:02:12.799> pad<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.190> I'm<00:02:13.280> going

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
actually a finishing pad but I'm going

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.580 
actually a finishing pad but I'm going
to<00:02:13.609> go<00:02:14.540> ahead<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.780> polish<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.200> same<00:02:15.380> area

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
to go ahead and polish the same area

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:26.350 
to go ahead and polish the same area
that<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.769> just<00:02:15.920> did<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.510> go

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.620 

all<00:02:27.360> right<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.160> taking<00:02:30.030> away<00:02:30.150> microfiber

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
all right so now taking away microfiber

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.880 
all right so now taking away microfiber

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
towel and of course I'm pushing on it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.630 
towel and of course I'm pushing on it
and<00:02:35.010> there's<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> lot<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> resistance<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.550> I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and there's a lot of resistance and as I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.870 
and there's a lot of resistance and as I
push<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.430> force<00:02:43.010> not<00:02:44.010> doing<00:02:44.820> a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.290 
push on it I want a force not doing a
very<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.150> job<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.600> cleaning<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.080> off

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.560 

this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.720> joy<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.020> working<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:54.570> Subaru

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
this is the joy of working on a Subaru

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.900 
this is the joy of working on a Subaru
paint<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:57.100> if<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.310> didn't<00:02:57.550> know<00:02:57.610> any<00:02:57.640> better

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
paint now if I didn't know any better

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.300 
paint now if I didn't know any better
I'd<00:02:58.120> say<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:58.780> paint<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.140> trashed<00:02:59.470> it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
I'd say that this paint is trashed it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.940 
I'd say that this paint is trashed it
doesn't<00:03:00.910> look<00:03:01.060> very<00:03:01.090> good<00:03:01.380> actually<00:03:02.380> it's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
doesn't look very good actually it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.680 
doesn't look very good actually it's
quite<00:03:03.160> horrid<00:03:03.990> it's<00:03:04.990> marred<00:03:05.380> up<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.690> there's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
quite horrid it's marred up and there's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650 
quite horrid it's marred up and there's
residue<00:03:08.110> all<00:03:08.350> over<00:03:08.380> its<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.340> Z<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.480> really

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
residue all over its a Z and it really

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.270 
residue all over its a Z and it really
doesn't<00:03:10.960> look<00:03:10.990> very<00:03:11.080> good<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:13.590> but<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
doesn't look very good and so but the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.350 
doesn't look very good and so but the
thing<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.460> that<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:15.910> actually<00:03:16.300> just

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
thing is that this is actually just

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600 
thing is that this is actually just
temporary<00:03:16.990> cuz<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.230> is<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:18.250> polish

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
temporary cuz this is just the polish

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.380 
temporary cuz this is just the polish
compound<00:03:19.150> that's<00:03:19.630> into<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.650> paint<00:03:21.330> okay<00:03:22.330> so

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
compound that's into the paint okay so

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.450 
compound that's into the paint okay so
what<00:03:22.630> I've<00:03:22.720> got<00:03:22.900> here<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.140> an<00:03:23.620> IPA<00:03:23.920> solution

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
what I've got here is an IPA solution

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.090 
what I've got here is an IPA solution
it's<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.760> mixture<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.350> half<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.560> half<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.800> water

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
it's a mixture of half and half of water

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.180 
it's a mixture of half and half of water
and<00:03:27.600> alcohol<00:03:28.600> isopropyl<00:03:28.930> alcohol

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
and alcohol isopropyl alcohol

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.090 
and alcohol isopropyl alcohol
it's<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.970> 91%<00:03:31.540> alcohol<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.470> when<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.800> cut

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
it's the 91% alcohol so when you cut

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.470 
it's the 91% alcohol so when you cut
that<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.340> half<00:03:33.460> you<00:03:33.880> end<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:34.300> something

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that in half you end up with something

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.350 
that in half you end up with something
about<00:03:34.840> 45%<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.520> what<00:03:36.640> I'm<00:03:36.730> gonna<00:03:36.880> do<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.240> I'm

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
about 45% so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.570 
about 45% so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:03:37.450> ply<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.410> here<00:03:38.980> I'm<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.280> spray<00:03:39.550> it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
gonna ply this to here I'm just spray it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.710 
gonna ply this to here I'm just spray it
on<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.500> then<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.740> want<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.950> wipe<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.540> wipe<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
on and then I want to wipe it wipe it

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.470 
on and then I want to wipe it wipe it
gently

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.759 

and<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:52.200> turns<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.739> that<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:54.769> application

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
and it turns out that one application

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.550 
and it turns out that one application
wasn't<00:03:56.069> enough<00:03:57.019> do<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.140> again<00:04:00.349> fairly<00:04:01.349> hard

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
wasn't enough do it again fairly hard

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.830 
wasn't enough do it again fairly hard
actually<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:05.330> off<00:04:07.580> more<00:04:08.840> about

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
actually do you get this off more about

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.620 
actually do you get this off more about
running<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.319> hard<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:12.480> have<00:04:12.599> a

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
running it so hard is that you have a

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.600 
running it so hard is that you have a
greater<00:04:12.959> chance<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.560> marring<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
greater chance of marring the the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.409 
greater chance of marring the the
surface<00:04:15.350> IPA<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:17.669> alcohol<00:04:18.060> tends<00:04:18.299> to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
surface IPA the alcohol tends to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.650 
surface IPA the alcohol tends to
evaporate<00:04:18.859> as<00:04:19.859> soon<00:04:20.070> as<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> spray<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.700> it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
evaporate as soon as you spray it on it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930 
evaporate as soon as you spray it on it
also<00:04:21.780> tends<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.320> cause<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.130> microfiber<00:04:23.700> towel

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
also tends to cause the microfiber towel

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.000 
also tends to cause the microfiber towel
to<00:04:24.090> drag<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.570> pain<00:04:24.780> causing<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.410> marring<00:04:25.860> as

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
to drag on the pain causing a marring as

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.110 
to drag on the pain causing a marring as
well

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.990 

you

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.060 

you
