00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.580
 i 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello I'm going to show you a very trick 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.559
 simple so you can sharpen your 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.289
 scissors quickly and easily 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 economic to have the sharp scissors is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.710
 something super important when we 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.330
 We dedicate to sewing so you have to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.610
 do these steps have I will indicate 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 with some frequency approximately 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.480
 once a month or every two months with 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.580
 all your scissors what you need to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 sharpen any type of scissors is a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.460
 sandpaper of the finest that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.520
 You also find it called sandpaper 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 and it's a very fine type of sandpaper that although 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 so we spend a little bit with the finger not 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 we sanded the finger and it is very fine then 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.040
 what we have to do is cut a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.040
 piece 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.329
 always keeping in mind open the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.249
 scissors to the maximum 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.249
 and cut to the very tip 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 I will be cutting with different scissors 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.009
 so you can see that with any of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.130
 they can be done normally 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:14.380
 I cut a piece 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.380
 and I'm making small strips 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.580
 to take advantage of the sandpaper to the maximum 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:30.870
 with each of your scissors you can do 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.870
 about three or four strips 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.870
 to sharpen your scissors 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.530
 What I like most about this trick is that 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.670
 even with scissors you can 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.189
 use 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.080
 these scissors that are usually so 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.860
 difficult to sharpen because it helps us 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.600
 normal sharpener 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.939
 they are very simple in the row 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.360
 with this method and also if not 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.910
 you find a sandpaper of this type 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.080
 you can use change paper 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 aluminum we will fold it in two and we will go 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.450
 doing the same cutting operation 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 in this case we need to do more 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.660
 cuts for each of the scissors 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.319
 because it sharpens a little less but 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.319
 it also serves 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.050
 If you have found it useful, I like it and 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.950
