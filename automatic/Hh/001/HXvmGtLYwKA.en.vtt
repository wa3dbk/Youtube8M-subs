00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
to make a repeating shotgun was that the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.399 
to make a repeating shotgun was that the
idea<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.390> pump<00:00:53.600> handle<00:00:53.749> was<00:00:54.079> already

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
idea of the pump handle was already

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:55.989 
idea of the pump handle was already
patented<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.129> he<00:00:55.280> had<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.429> come<00:00:55.579> up<00:00:55.609> with<00:00:55.789> some

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
patented so he had to come up with some

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.349 
patented so he had to come up with some
other<00:00:56.210> way<00:00:56.389> to<00:00:56.449> do<00:00:56.749> it<00:00:56.780> what<00:00:57.679> he<00:00:57.829> did<00:00:58.190> was<00:00:59.120> to

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
other way to do it what he did was to

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.689

make<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.809> actual<00:01:00.109> grip<00:01:00.499> of<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.799> gun<00:01:00.949> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
moving handle so cock this to make these

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.700

infringing on the existing patents and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.760 
infringing on the existing patents and

something<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.020> looks<00:01:30.230> weird<00:01:30.440> today<00:01:30.860> but

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
something that looks weird today but

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
like this so what's holding it together

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.990 
like this so what's holding it together
are<00:04:49.340> these<00:04:49.639> locking<00:04:50.030> ribs<00:04:50.650> which<00:04:51.650> fit<00:04:51.919> into

receiver once the gun is open like this

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.800 
receiver once the gun is open like this
you<00:04:59.539> can<00:04:59.690> see<00:04:59.870> there<00:05:00.050> are<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.259> pair<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.800> cutouts

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
you can see there are a pair of cutouts

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.100 
you can see there are a pair of cutouts
one<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.139> wrist<00:05:04.069> one<00:05:04.819> in<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.090> butt<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.080> that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
one in the wrist one in the butt so that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.610 
one in the wrist one in the butt so that
the<00:05:06.409> thing<00:05:06.590> rests<00:05:07.039> nice<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.729> compact<00:05:08.349> we<00:05:09.349> can

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
the thing rests nice and compact we can

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.540 
the thing rests nice and compact we can
then<00:05:09.919> take<00:05:10.370> this<00:05:10.840> lever<00:05:12.220> fold<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.370> back<00:05:13.520> down

then take this lever fold it back down

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.120 
then take this lever fold it back down
and<00:05:14.090> because<00:05:14.870> we<00:05:15.050> have<00:05:15.169> an<00:05:15.289> angled<00:05:15.680> surface

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
and because we have an angled surface

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.450 
and because we have an angled surface
here<00:05:16.370> on<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.610> hook<00:05:16.789> a<00:05:17.710> sharp<00:05:18.710> motion<00:05:19.280> of

here on the hook a sharp motion of
closing<00:05:19.909> the<00:05:20.000> gun<00:05:21.460> will<00:05:22.460> actually<00:05:22.940> pop<00:05:23.120> that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
closing the gun will actually pop that

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.149 
closing the gun will actually pop that
lever<00:05:23.569> into<00:05:23.840> place<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.470> lock<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.740> gun<00:05:25.009> up

often on this but that's how you would
have<00:05:29.330> originally<00:05:29.750> done<00:05:29.900> this<00:05:30.050> if<00:05:30.199> you<00:05:30.289> needed
