00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 Praise is acrylic patella I put a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.829
 little pot and fight with a little water 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.420
 Let's start putting loads and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.420
 noticed the old white thread 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:10.909
 we will like the brush will spin and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.909
 up coast descending 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.270
 with the tip where the body of the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 Former agent is going to have a little knock. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 so it 's just to make a car one 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.290
 Heat in a glass of milk 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.590
 never had a move here is to exclude 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.590
 huh 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.740
 We 'll get the princess fleith self. 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 milk 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.040
 let's look at the white paint 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.530
 here they will finish here with the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.530
 people grew up and neither side 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 do a little trick that invades so it ends 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.510
 much better is enough 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 We 're going to hit again because the 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.120
 boring 360 for minc 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.400
 Let's wash it. I'll use it here now. 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.110
 the green ink s that the olive green ink 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 tva and I'm going to use this green software 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.640
 that it is woven 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.540
 I'll pick you up with the two of you. 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.540
 We're going to make the leaves. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.950
 Folhinha already has what we want 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.950
 always leaned up and posted went up 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:28.019
 I'll come here it was easier or I liked it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.019
 coming up steered 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:43.739
 Now we're going with the black ink on the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.739
 black ink and a led fillet brush 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.970
 the woman affected 30 the more 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.950
 Unify this brings you better, will you? 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.269
 sometimes when you're ready where you 're going 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.269
 receive after my book 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.770
 let's control now looks 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:47.210
 Let's do another subject here well. 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:49.790
 thin and today preventing the upgrade 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.250
 glass of milk can vary greatly in 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.070
 thigh and can use ivory with and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.940
 white if you want more light, right? 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.470
 can wear the orange red it 's all 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.720
 combined with practically white 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.910
 invented before the pps can also 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.790
 combine with two colors of this type pink 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.670
 and lilac will look good with pink and 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.560
 Purple will be a thing but 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.410
 I arrived but it 's not to like. 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.810
 this is the yellow I think it's yellow 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 gold I just can not go wrong it's metallic 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.360
 cloth paint and metal screen that give 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.060
 a cool yellow common melton effect 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.790
 this risk is always he and the ink 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.850
 is one of those who appreciate the 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.230
 champion to realize that he does not have 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.890
 references or not but I have one 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.850
 number 553 has no name but I think 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.110
 metallic yellow metallic ink and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.810
 people will end up making a 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.280
 treatment with the polka dots or you can 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:56.600
 make some flowers here at your 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:59.230
 criterion to do what I'm going to do in this 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.230
 plan 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.960
 the CÃºcuta design 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.599
 I hope to help you no kiss building
