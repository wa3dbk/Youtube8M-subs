one<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.490> really<00:00:16.790> interesting<00:00:16.820> things

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
one of the really interesting things

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.010 
one of the really interesting things
that's<00:00:17.869> happened<00:00:17.930> here<00:00:19.720> when<00:00:20.720> we<00:00:20.869> were

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
that's happened here when we were

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.690 
that's happened here when we were
putting<00:00:21.200> or<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.830> father<00:00:22.010> in<00:00:22.220> particular<00:00:22.310> was

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
putting or the father in particular was

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.060 
putting or the father in particular was
putting<00:00:23.590> basically<00:00:24.590> a<00:00:24.619> hundred<00:00:24.860> weight<00:00:24.980> to

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
putting basically a hundred weight to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.640 
putting basically a hundred weight to

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
fertilizer our production off this place

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.910 
fertilizer our production off this place
now<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.650> at<00:00:33.980> least<00:00:34.220> equal<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:35.720> that<00:00:36.680> time

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
now is at least equal to that that time

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.200 
now is at least equal to that that time
when<00:00:37.100> we're<00:00:37.250> spending<00:00:37.460> all<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.670> money<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:37.970> on

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
when we're spending all that money on on

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.990 
when we're spending all that money on on
super<00:00:38.480> phosphate<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:40.040> know<00:00:40.400> we<00:00:40.670> can<00:00:40.820> drive

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
super phosphate and I know we can drive

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.060 
super phosphate and I know we can drive
it<00:00:41.030> better<00:00:41.330> than<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:41.780> ya<00:00:42.140> know<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:42.530> if<00:00:42.769> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
it better than that ya know so if the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.430 
it better than that ya know so if the
lambing<00:00:43.640> has<00:00:43.790> increased<00:00:44.300> blemings<00:00:44.989> increased

one of the really interesting things

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.049 
one of the really interesting things
here<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.080> relation<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.530> wool<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.220> that<00:00:49.879> our

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
here in relation to wool is that our

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.910 
here in relation to wool is that our
tensile<00:00:50.449> strengths<00:00:50.809> improved<00:00:51.199> enormously<00:00:51.440> in

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
tensile strengths improved enormously in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.170 
tensile strengths improved enormously in
the<00:00:52.129> wall<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.379> very<00:00:54.589> sound<00:00:55.070> wool<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.699> good

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
the wall and and very sound wool a good

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.289 
the wall and and very sound wool a good
quality<00:00:56.510> wool<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.900> it<00:00:56.989> related<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.589> having

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
quality wool and it related to having

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.869 
quality wool and it related to having
good<00:00:59.299> quality<00:00:59.510> feed<00:01:00.080> at<00:01:00.379> all<00:01:00.589> times<00:01:01.460> the

feed for the animals brings back the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.080 
feed for the animals brings back the
better<00:01:07.100> wool<00:01:07.340> qualities

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
better wool qualities

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.410 
better wool qualities
yeah<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:09.590> by<00:01:10.280> by<00:01:10.790> restoring

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
yeah that and and just by by restoring

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.120 
yeah that and and just by by restoring
at<00:01:11.810> least<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.170> function<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.710> grassland

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
at least the function of a grassland

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.280 
at least the function of a grassland
you've<00:01:13.820> got<00:01:14.030> something<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.780> plant<00:01:15.200> that

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
you've got something that a plant that

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.840 
you've got something that a plant that
will<00:01:15.500> respond<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.950> every<00:01:16.190> rainfall<00:01:16.580> event

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
will respond to every rainfall event

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.520 
will respond to every rainfall event
he's<00:01:17.149> got<00:01:17.299> very<00:01:17.479> even<00:01:17.810> feet<00:01:18.049> throughout<00:01:18.409> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
he's got very even feet throughout the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.550 
he's got very even feet throughout the
year<00:01:18.729> yeah<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.780> tensile<00:01:21.170> strength<00:01:21.409> is

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
year yeah and the tensile strength is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.080 
year yeah and the tensile strength is
known<00:01:21.680> la<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.340> shocks<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.850> growth

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
known la that to the shocks in growth

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.630 
known la that to the shocks in growth
occurs<00:01:23.899> of<00:01:24.109> growth<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.619> reflected<00:01:25.399> in<00:01:25.549> the

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
state in tensile Stan gable okay yeah

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.830 
state in tensile Stan gable okay yeah
yeah<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:28.880> that's<00:01:29.329> now<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:29.659> an

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
yeah so this that's now that an

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.200 
yeah so this that's now that an
indicator<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.469> this<00:01:30.710> kind<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.210> management

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
indicator that this kind of management

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.990 
indicator that this kind of management
of<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.539> pasture<00:01:33.159> increases<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.369> full-time

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
of the pasture increases the full-time

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.789 
of the pasture increases the full-time
productivity<00:01:35.719> of<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.020> same<00:01:36.229> kind<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.619> quality

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
try together and not only that we can be

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.419 
try together and not only that we can be
at<00:01:43.609> least<00:01:43.789> as<00:01:44.030> productive<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:45.619> probably<00:01:46.219> more

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
at least as productive and probably more

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.300 
at least as productive and probably more
but<00:01:47.270> our<00:01:47.479> costs<00:01:47.929> is<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:48.200> much<00:01:48.380> later<00:01:48.799> but

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
but our costs is so much later but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.830 
but our costs is so much later but
immediately<00:01:49.850> we're<00:01:50.030> saving<00:01:50.299> fifty<00:01:50.509> thousand

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
immediately we're saving fifty thousand
