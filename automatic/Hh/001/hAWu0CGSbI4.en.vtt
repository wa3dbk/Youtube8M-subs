00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.159
 today we will do something a little different I will not go 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.460
 talk about video games but one of my favorite cartoon series 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.560
 I marked my childhood titeuf 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 Let's go 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.090

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.700
 Paris 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.980
 cheryl 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 it is 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.589
 Yes 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.450
 his project 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.140
 property its versatility 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.480
 if lille the rest is ok his side 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.360
 perfect to support 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 in the early 80s 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 cartoonist 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.920
 your son 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 it's this birthday 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 these encounters without defeat 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.820
 why do your own role 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.810
 g 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.640
 titeuf 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.820
 god sex and braces 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.510
 this is still the case currently how many died in service 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.560
 the graphics leave a little to be desired especially at the level of the decor d 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.120
 it's the worst it's the strictest costs the series when I find it 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.070
 is normal 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 that this album is a little worse than the others 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.970
 a bitter debate within the twenty-seven 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 always on track 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 in practice 2 love 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.189
 we notice the total graphical change 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.239
 risk 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.029
 first time titeuf is in color 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.880
 from an aesthetic point of view the past 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.689
 two days earlier to say it 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 retention 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.889
 otherwise we do not always find the same fate of this discipline m 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 find your place 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.589
 263 decrease in diet 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:40.849
 he is a boatman 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.189
 m 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.549
 this index is composed mainly of this type of account also some 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.839
 seconds that lasts more than once like for example about 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.249
 on the road to propose adventures 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 graphically it has not changed much but it's not answering you 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:05.149
 in the context of the pnr of the terrible test now let's go to the prosecutor 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.029
 8:15 is for everyone 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.889
 from the point of view of the history of the series n 9 occurred 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 which is not at all the sentence that tonight 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:18.739
 this control 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.769
 graphically, however, to refine a slight progress 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.179
 it's now the top 5 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.659
 there were things 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.279
 still no irony on the series 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.939
 it's one of the only negative reviews I give all 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:34.689
 series 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.129
 but the main character of his friends a person is good 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.809
 from Friday evening 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.079
 otherwise the boys excel as usual but it's just a little bit more 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.469
 see them a little more 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.469
 the graphics are beautiful a revolution 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.519
 Here now 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.150
 maybe I rather prefer cool all summer for them 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.979
 previous 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.920
 small 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.129
 on a first 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.730
 so the first thing you notice is that the average was 56 cents 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.829
 it is to be always more funny there are also stories several pages 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.769
 the spokesman the eponymous series we learn that the sea of ​​tents in sum 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.289
 maybe maybe not every day 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.289
 it's at the beginning of the season 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.519
 all lovers of this sport 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.159
 titeuf phone 7 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.330
 virapoullé 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.539
 how was it + shit + dodge went from some surprising 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.439
 now has a little sister named here 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.669
 they fell back here 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.740
 and you do not seem so because it could have been worse 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.749
 m 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.120
 but I'm proud 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.900
 the artist explained this Bordeaux victory for that of the continent 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.550
 anyway 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.779
 photo of 8 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.020
 drop me the site 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.240
 I have absolutely nothing to complain about 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.440
 excellent graphics galaxy perdreau the for terrebonne life source similar for 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.819
 volume 9 of the law of the strongest who is very similar and that's good 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.740
 dresdner bank focus our attention on the long term if it is to 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.289
 say get married 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.969
 this volume is different from the others because it's one big story of 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:21.860
 you 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.929
 they are not separate pieces and the result is great 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.690
 graphically it's also excellent than previous ones 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.509
 so here now only one time but their fight 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.740
 as repetitive as I can be this plan contains galaxies bernard m 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.360
 we are working on new characters 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.279
 a master who will temporarily replace mistress 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.559
 this character will be ephemeral but good 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.559
 graphic side is sublime after an article 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.610
 here is the last album of the kind of passage 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.610
 do you say that the meaning of life 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
 when the weakest of the city development 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.889
 others have said 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.050
 to go from childhood to home 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.050
 the album it is not about the whole is a joke 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.839
 Belgium is going 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.839
 I think it happened 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.659
 however, there are others 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.869
 by a little more 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:27.159
 from this evening 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.159
 with matches both can decide 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.029
 lower 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.999
 that's what I call 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.009
 a comedy 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.589
 there are rumors according to the government 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.589
 joe 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.770
 but also to everyday scenes 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.689
 very quickly in the world of cinema 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:53.689
 19% 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.439
 you want to know the anecdotes 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.359
 it's too expensive
