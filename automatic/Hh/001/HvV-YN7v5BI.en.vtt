00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.899 
but I decided that I would go ahead and
I<00:03:13.959> will<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.260> try<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.530> reapply<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
reason I tried to reapply this because I

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.220
