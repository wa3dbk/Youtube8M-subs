00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
wasn't working and I was using it to try

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.260 
wasn't working and I was using it to try
and<00:00:16.650> test<00:00:16.920> voltages<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.820> having<00:00:17.970> all

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and test voltages and I was having all

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.019 
and test voltages and I was having all
my<00:00:18.859> voltage<00:00:19.859> regulator<00:00:20.400> issues<00:00:22.279> pretty<00:00:23.279> sure

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
my voltage regulator issues pretty sure

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.160 
my voltage regulator issues pretty sure
this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.289> problem

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170

that's my problem Oh first of all it's a
30<00:00:40.230> amp<00:00:40.469> fuse<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.870> 20<00:00:42.870> amp<00:00:43.020> spot<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.090> find

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
30 amp fuse in a 20 amp spot but I find

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.119 
30 amp fuse in a 20 amp spot but I find
it<00:00:45.899> interesting<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.960> dome<00:00:48.960> cargo<00:00:49.829> lamp

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it interesting that the dome cargo lamp

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
it interesting that the dome cargo lamp
clock<00:00:50.430> glider<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.360> horn<00:00:51.989> relay<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
clock glider and horn relay are all on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.049 
clock glider and horn relay are all on
the<00:00:53.309> same<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> blow<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the same thing so you know if you blow a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
the same thing so you know if you blow a
fuse<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:58.350> lighter<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.309> did

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fuse on your lighter like I just did

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.299 
fuse on your lighter like I just did
then<00:00:59.850> apparently<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.329> horn<00:01:00.510> won't<00:01:00.780> work

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
then apparently your horn won't work

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
then apparently your horn won't work
it<00:01:02.309> seems<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.699> strange<00:01:03.480> seems<00:01:03.960> like

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it seems a little strange seems like

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
it seems a little strange seems like
lighter<00:01:04.379> should<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.600> don't<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.689> some

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
lighter should be on I don't know some

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.640 
lighter should be on I don't know some
kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.170> auxilary<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.270> anyways<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:11.640> going

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650

find one of those Evelynn somewhere
pretty<00:01:16.140> standard<00:01:16.680> fuse<00:01:19.850> I'll<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> fixed

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
pretty standard fuse I'll get a fixed

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.300 
pretty standard fuse I'll get a fixed
looked<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.850> emergency<00:01:24.420> box<00:01:24.659> I

carry with me
and<00:01:28.630> look<00:01:29.049> what<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.229> found<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.710> phrase

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
and look what I found use this phrase

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.219 
and look what I found use this phrase
your<00:01:32.890> neck<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:34.240> they'll<00:01:34.450> work<00:01:38.759> yeah<00:01:39.759> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
your neck think they'll work yeah I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.600 
your neck think they'll work yeah I
think<00:01:41.229> that'll<00:01:41.649> do<00:01:41.799> it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.540 

if<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:47.480> see<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.020> says<00:01:48.200> 20<00:01:48.650> side

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
if you can see it but it says 20 side

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.500 
if you can see it but it says 20 side
down<00:01:50.890> 20<00:01:51.890> I'm<00:01:52.280> gonna<00:01:52.400> replace<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:52.790> with<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.180> 20

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
down 20 I'm gonna replace it with the 20

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.700 
down 20 I'm gonna replace it with the 20
since<00:01:54.760> since<00:01:55.760> that's<00:01:56.000> what<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.240> manual<00:01:56.710> calls

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
since since that's what the manual calls

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:11.310 
since since that's what the manual calls
for<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:05.740> should<00:02:06.740> be<00:02:06.890> done<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.130> see<00:02:10.369> that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
for and should be done you can see that

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.240 
for and should be done you can see that
holding<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:13.870> phone<00:02:15.370> an<00:02:16.370> old<00:02:16.610> flashlight

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
holding the phone an old flashlight

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.370 
holding the phone an old flashlight
often<00:02:20.470> results<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.390> accidentally<00:02:24.020> stop

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
often results and we accidentally stop

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.140 
often results and we accidentally stop
in<00:02:24.560> my<00:02:24.709> videotaping<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.209> anyways<00:02:26.510> either<00:02:27.410> done

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
in my videotaping so anyways either done

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.390 
in my videotaping so anyways either done
take<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.209> quick<00:02:29.360> test<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:30.100> yep

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
take a quick test here yep

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.200 
take a quick test here yep
I<00:02:31.660> think<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.810> fixed
