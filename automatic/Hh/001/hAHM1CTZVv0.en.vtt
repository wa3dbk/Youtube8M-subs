00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 ok so re hello olivier lagrÃ©ou de 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.770
 nokia this time we'll talk about 1320 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.960
 so it was announced to abou dhabi on 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 is still on a 6 inch screen 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 we are on a product in terms of price 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.940
 which is going to be a lot more and more 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 affordable it's a little lumia 625 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 6 inch screen version 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.750
 so he takes over the design and the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.000
 main specifications the lumia 625 the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410
 goal has democratized the 4g there with a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.779
 light yannick 320 we will try 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.080
 democratize the screens the screens 6 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 inch 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.700
 so we have a nice 6 inch HD screen 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.920
 does not have hulls as we can see 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 that will be interchangeable and still 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 once with colors very very 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 punchy we have a camera 5 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 million pixels that is here a flash 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.399
 led 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 this is the same specifications 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
 calimia 625 we have 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.780
 embedded that can obviously be of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.289
 thanks to a microsd slot that is integrated 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.949
 under the hall the cover on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.140
 still a screen 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.640
 ok - saying that at 1500 light but who 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.379
 remains a very beautiful screen since we have a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.490
 hd screen that is protected by gorilla 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.740
 glass so very very robust we are on 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.310
 a dual-core processor so a little 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.630
 less fast 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.000
 now the important thing is that the water 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.869
 is still so fluid and among 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 all our ranges 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.290
 we have different types of processors and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 I think you can for those who 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.770
 have been able to try 501 for example which has 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 the processor may be the least 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 fast and that's no problem lag 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.229
 it's very fluid there is no 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.240
 problem of speed in the in 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.799
 interface so the 1300 is the same 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 even with a dual core will allow you 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.290
 to wander you will quickly put among 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.270
 your applications c it is carrier too 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.369
 of the new version 2 2 of windows 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 phone so with this third line of 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.810
 thumbnails convoy overworked which allows a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.549
 extreme customization it is going 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 obviously benefit all following 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.960
 of oka applications that we know so 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.640
 there free gps free music 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.220
 this is really an experience 6 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.410
 inches for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.780
 where our customers who were not necessarily 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.710
 want to put as much money as that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.360
 but they still want to be able to 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.160
 have a great experience on a big 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.300
 screen to be able to surf watching 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.369
 mobile videos 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.720
 we have a battery that is pretty 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.060
 phenomenal then on a battery which one 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 has a battery of 3400 milliamperes what 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.840
 ensure a very very good autonomy 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.100
 ex 1300 it's a product that will 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.110
 available a little later 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.570
 since it will arrive in the east towards the end 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.580
 of the first quarter of 2014 which will be 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.680
 available first in some 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.450
 regions like Asia before coming back 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.180
 with us in europe so it will take 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.100
 start with him the 500 and after paseo 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.440
 1328 equip you with several 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.440
 products here thank you
