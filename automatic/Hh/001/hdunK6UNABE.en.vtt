come<00:03:57.120> through<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.450> stroke<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.650> way<00:03:58.770> you

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
come through the stroke so the way you

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.620 
come through the stroke so the way you
hear<00:03:59.400> paying<00:04:00.180> strict<00:04:00.390> attention<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:02.280> how<00:04:02.460> the

are<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.500> sort<00:04:07.770> of<00:04:07.860> let<00:04:08.070> these

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
are going and then you sort of let these

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.120 
are going and then you sort of let these
little<00:04:08.490> nuances<00:04:08.730> come<00:04:09.450> through<00:04:10.290> these<00:04:10.500> sweeps

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
little nuances come through these sweeps

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.510 
little nuances come through these sweeps
and<00:04:11.400> tics<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.910> taps<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.500> idea<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.040> main<00:04:14.160> idea

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
and tics and taps the idea the main idea

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.460 
and tics and taps the idea the main idea
is<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.790> some<00:04:15.030> fun<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:15.810> keep<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.230> groove

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
is to have some fun but keep the groove

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.630 
is to have some fun but keep the groove
and<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:17.100> groove<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.670> 1<00:04:18.360> 2<00:04:18.989> 3<00:04:19.620> 4<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.580> the
