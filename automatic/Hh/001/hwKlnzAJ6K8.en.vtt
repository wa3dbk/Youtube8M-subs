00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello everyone in this new video I'm going 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.690
 to bring two applications to hack 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.730
 your games to get coins 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.160
 free in the games it costs 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.840
 quite get coins or just 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.080
 if you want to buy more things more 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.510
 characters of your good games is 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.190
 with two applications that practically 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 they do the same thing a week in killer and 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:27.090
 another game ch is written like this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.080
 if you look in the car and why in the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 play store are not and downloads 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 First we will teach so 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.809
 it can be with a different game 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 someone killers with here you give back 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.530
 with used this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.980
 with the heads ok 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.910
 as you see here you have it activated is 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.910
 still 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.220
 you put it there that does not bother 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 and then we give the arcade whatever 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.080
 you have to have a minimum here so that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.540
 you can buy something because now 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.420
 was explained 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.770
 we give you here we put in the amount that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.770
 we have 1400 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.220
 then we will find you auto identify 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.500
 we two go back we bought 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.420
 something we give again 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.950
 now we put the amount we have 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 right now that's 900 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.980
 let's go find you will not go out then 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.710
 we give him here and where he puts the ball 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 and we can change everything 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.980
 we want 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.330
 for example 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.450
 30,000 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.289
 finished ok the mouse bought something 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.289
 that we have with this money 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 and this as you see now puts 29,500 and so 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.390
 with everything you want and you can 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.110
 have all the money you want from 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.000
 buy these good things now let 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.610
 see the other 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.030
 good is before the c rice 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.360
 what do we see here exists and is in 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.520
 one single 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.000
 and the other one that is practically the same 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.290
 we will teach it with the temporary 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.290
 we wait for it to load 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.740
 here is not this thing that can be 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.250
 hide as you see there is a process 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.250
 so 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.730
 temples won 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.459
 as you will see it is practically the same 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.650
 but there are some that can work in 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.950
 the applications or in other cities 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.950
 but 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.940
 back we give you augured abilities you see 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.960
 there I have 500 thousand that's what I've 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.490
 fact 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.490
 but I will explain how 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.610
 we give you here we give you to look for this 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.540
 type of name 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.590
 and we put what we have there 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.590
 500 thousand 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.180
 we give him ok he will be looking to be chinese 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.390
 then now we go back 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.920
 we buy something 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 Then we will look for you again 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:45.410
 and we look for the number that matches the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.410
 soda and puts 485,000 because this one here does not 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.140
 we give him ok 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.740
 we look back 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.740
 there is more 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.980
 but I had never made myself wait for those 3 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.659
 seconds then now we put what 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.659
 we want if we want a million 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.110
 3 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.630
 we give Modify that we are going backwards 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.920
 we buy something 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.200
 as you see now it puts 975,000 I do not know if it 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.840
 he sees a lot but he has already achieved 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.540
 the good money and as you have seen in 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.420
 the lite version is expected 3 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.040
 seconds but works equally good 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 I hope we liked to know served 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.840
 good also to go out to give him a 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.669
 and this is 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.669
 and until the next day to day
