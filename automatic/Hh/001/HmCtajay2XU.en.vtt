 easy to use and the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.210
 information on the huge 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.870
 Screen are also from the fund too 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.489
 recognize 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.590
 we are each in trier of the 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.960
 Building class and if I give you the design 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.780
 could explain then it says the following 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.000
 What we have designed is like that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.880
 named guideline annual purity or 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 in German said sensual clarity 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.479
 how does this sensual explain itself? 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.790
 clarity when they blackboard on which 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.979
 look then you see the upper edge 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.900
 from the blackboard is a very quiet line 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.940
 there is a second line and 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 which covers the inserted control 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.560
 from the center console 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.540
 these two lines are actually 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.979
 mainly where the focus of that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.110
 design on is that means if you are 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.940
 the customer enters and looks up 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.789
 diet open recognizes only these two 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.490
 lines that determine these so-called 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.899
 sensual clarity but also very 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.310
 important is what you see here one 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.660
 Of course, the stages are 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 components such as the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.300
 air nozzles such as the switches 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.890
 and as for example this trackpad very important 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.410
 is where we put in a lot of energy 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.780
 have the appearance quality when you are 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.190
 look at the following pictures if you like 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.140
 look closely at how the switches 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.860
 are arranged and how are themselves 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 feel 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.030
 So it's from the feel that he is 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.280
 very important core element for this 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.280
 Design of this building interior 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.580
 Overall, we are thrilled 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.459
 processing the class with theirs 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.290
 fine details thought out and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.290
 contemporary gentleman customers expect from 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.640
 us a car and put it in the car 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.160
 series also in nomenclature 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.099
 it's his class and there to be classified 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.750
 it is a little hoarse woman class 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.580
 in the product name actually also in it 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.220
 that the car won more in class 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.890
 whether the car has gained more in class 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 I do not know, I think so too 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.630
 car if you ask me is really 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.630
 class 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.510
 we drive with the top model v 250 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.629
 bluetec as with all v class models 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.249
 with a 2 1 liter turbodiesel with 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.510
 a combined consumption of six 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.269
 specified in the list 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.939
 we consider less than eight liters for 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.099
 easily feasible 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.439
 convincing is the 360 ​​degree camera 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.260
 It is very handy when maneuvering 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.819
 Parking assistant park the class 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.569
 desire own one 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.419
 our model has 190 ps at full throttle 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.639
 can be raised up to 204 ps 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:19.269
 a price performance ratio of 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:22.060
 the finest we have tried is im 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.989
 car also a piece of beauty and design 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.579
 mitzugeben 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.260
 Safety is a whole for us 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.109
 important point is a mercedes 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.599
 but sometimes comfort is a whole 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.159
 important to the motto if 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.780
 They look to the side of the vehicle 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.209
 then they actually see mainly 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.709
 only one line that means we have one 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.989
 very clean line that determines the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.579
 Clarity of vehicle in combination with 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.220
 the cut from the side wall you see 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.650
 quite a change from comte konvex 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.810
 and concave that means it starts very much 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 nice light it starts here very nice 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.970
 shadow light shadow and this 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.739
 balance with the clear line determines a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.769
 looking at the form-language single 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.470
 pretty pretty if you see it 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.459
 always has to get on the vehicle 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.229
 every time you recognize that again 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.509
 this line one sees this line goes 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.069
 very nice is interrupted here 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.859
 but the conflict comes very nice 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.840
 down in the bumper area runs down 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.939
 and this curved line with the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.989
 Complain then the side is again 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.989
 sensual clarity 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.590
 on long stretches is one 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.350
 travel speed between 130 and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.020
 150 ideal here are talks at 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.030
 Room volume possible at full throttle 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.890
 the turbodiesel sounds quite well 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.350
 pithy for that he reaches the 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.330
 top speed of 206 kilometers 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.330
 fast and easy per hour 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.560
 Mr dr bänziger they tell me yet 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.670
 conclusion what is actually price range 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.320
 of this new model the car of 42,900 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.110
 euro 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.210
 Of course you can do that too 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.220
 it's clear we want to 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.350
 also very price sensitive customer 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.490
 respond with the motto and when will come 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.230
 the car to the dealer 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.530
 this will happen in germany at the end of may 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.530
 hands
