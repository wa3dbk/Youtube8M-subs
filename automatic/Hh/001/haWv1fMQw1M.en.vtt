00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 authors of the great and unconditionally cult 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 gothic continue to delight fans 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.990
 series of new games and let the last three 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.539
 are called quite differently we are with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 you know that this is gothic 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 but not some other rbg owners 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 trademark creation of 4 parts only 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.160
 proved that the famous name 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.070
 will only name if it is not 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 correct content and piranha bytes 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.690
 the only developer capable of it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.300
 create content and now came out 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 the third part of the game which the piranhas are quite 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 successfully do without jo that's how much 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.059
 managed risen 3 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.059
 learn in our review 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 piranha bytes is one of those few 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.690
 companies that are extremely loyal to their 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.090
 Fans so as not to upset them 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 they have for many years left everything without 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 changes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.470
 combat mechanics reputation system pumping 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.049
 christoph types and much much more all 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 done so to speak on one pattern 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.930
 good or bad judge for yourself but the fact 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.810
 The fact remains that the system has been worked out and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.330
 it works well it does change sometimes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.149
 only setting and reasons for which we 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 save the world somehow save him 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.069
 I still have to, but on my own 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.860
 will or randomly in every part 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:40.350
 goes out differently in risen 3 again no one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.600
 was not going to reinvent the wheel game 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.940
 made according to the established scheme, except 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.799
 the setting has changed again this time our 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.110
 the main character is a successful pirate 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 decent robbery and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.830
 treasure hunt 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.880
 however during one of these searches 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.369
 in the catacombs 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.890
 he gains on a strange portal from 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.140
 the portal to him comes out angry 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.750
 ghost with bad intentions and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.289
 completely unceremoniously sucks out 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.060
 nameless hero all life forces 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.340
 the protagonist is buried and then the cheerful magician 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.519
 water familiar to us from the previous part 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.349
 it quickens yes yes bad luck soul 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.129
 stayed with the evil and ill-mannered 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.680
 ghost 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.319
 such a set later as easy 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.870
 guess will lead us to save the world 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.129
 and do not care about all that the motives of the main 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.560
 the hero is perfect 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.420
 selfish further then everything goes on 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.760
 knurled we need 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.040
 earn a reputation and choose one of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 three factions so it has been since 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 the first gothic will have to choose between 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 uncouth and magicians water and hewn them 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.250
 I will not be magicians 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.890
 and demonic hunters depending on 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 completely different quiz and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.680
 yavine plot that gives a great start on 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.379
 subsequent replayability of at least 2 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.840
 times most jobs refers to 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.209
 bring the categories feed and psla nah not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.780
 hampered by an errand boy will have to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.390
 be bottom up to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.030
 the very top unless customers will 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.490
 change but gothic fans have long been accustomed 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.980
 to such a scheme and it suits everyone 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.540
 the combat system is also not much changed 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.300
 over the past 13 years 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.030
 time-tested kick block system 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.250
 can give odds to many fashionable battles 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.260
 com but everything also has one main 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.670
 the problem 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.630
 monotony due to which by the middle 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.880
 fighting games 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.000
 already sick of the arsenal of weapons 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.750
 quite rich and diverse locations and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.540
 fauna 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.440
 one of the virtues of risen 3 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.050
 elaboration and diversity 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.480
 downbeat bestiary 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.550
 so rich is vast that absolutely 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.970
 everywhere there will be some no 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.890
 animals of various appearance 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.500
 only one desire unites them 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.810
 we, in turn, must also kill 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.540
 be interested in killing the poor and 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.850
 not very animals because for us 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.860
 give invaluable experience through which 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.530
 we can pump our core 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.290
 the characteristics of the special skill can also 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.930
 learn only from teachers for gold 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.630
 in general, everything is like in the good old days 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.079
 locations are divided into islands from each of 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.420
 which 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.820
 unique design with its atmosphere 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.880
 the presence of both fabulous heavenly and 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.030
 terrible of ski and the same everywhere 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.280
 dangerous old school lovers may 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.560
 to please the fact that the menagerie 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.870
 not adapts to our level then 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.940
 there is always a chance to find somewhere not 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.419
 go there and hit the top of the hat 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.460
 a rigorous opponent of special attention 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.070
 deserves imitation of life in the settlements 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.039
 it is implemented on pretty good 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.500
 each inhabitant has his own 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.360
 daily routine and all his immaculately 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.570
 keep the blacksmith forges 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.070
 About Barbarian guard guard in general all 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.020
 as people have dialogue with these very 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.540
 none of the best things in risen 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.210
 communicate even with ordinary passersby always 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.400
 interesting everyone has their own problems and 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.440
 joy and some may also 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.600
 heart story tell 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.880
 our hero, too, behind the word in his pocket is not 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.950
 climbs and on occasion lets go different 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.710
 jokes in general behaves like 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.710
 real pirate risen 3 eat 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.110
 absolutely everything you need for a good lpg 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.240
 and each of the items is made on 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.450
 very high level which is not surprising 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.230
 because piranhas have eaten more than one 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.910
 the dog 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.370
 that's just the problem is that 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.650
 developers too stick 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.230
 its old standards because of what 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.140
 it seems that you are somewhere 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.020
 this is already seen there are not any innovative 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.230
 ideas and special pieces because of what the background 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.600
 competitors that will come very soon 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.670
 risen 3 looks faded to the same 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.100
 graphics despite the colorfulness and 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.590
 pretty good quality modern 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.290
 it's hard to call you outdated 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.840
 animation and some cardboard without 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.670
 emotional faces but if you consider that 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.040
 brought to the same dragon age yet 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.410
 several months and this time with 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.350
 more than enough to enjoy risen 3 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.720
 we strongly recommend 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.500
 shopping is a little bit outdated 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.510
 unsightly u but still correct lpg 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.120
 especially if you are a fan of the previous series 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.670
 of this game but we will hope that for 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.770
 the next part of the piranhas will allocate less 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.830
 modest budget and we can 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.450
 see a truly next-gene gothic 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.750
 even if it will be called 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:31.140
 in a different way and today everything is for you 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.520
