the one with a red turntable is the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.830 
the one with a red turntable is the
original<00:00:07.770> hit<00:00:08.069> entertainment<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
one with a green turntable is the new

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.480 
one with a green turntable is the new
fisher-price<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:13.049> they<00:00:13.860> both<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.309> together

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
fisher-price one they both go together

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.220 
fisher-price one they both go together
in<00:00:14.940> more<00:00:15.089> or<00:00:15.179> less<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> same<00:00:15.599> way<00:00:15.660> but<00:00:15.929> there

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
in more or less the same way but there

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.019 
in more or less the same way but there
are<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:16.590> subtle<00:00:16.770> differences<00:00:17.130> between<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
are some subtle differences between the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.450 
are some subtle differences between the
pieces<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.660> they're<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.990> interchangeable

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
pieces so they're not interchangeable

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.620 
pieces so they're not interchangeable
I'll<00:00:20.460> show<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> how<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.359> them<00:00:21.480> together

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
I'll show you how to put them together

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.740 
I'll show you how to put them together
now<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:23.310> I've<00:00:23.400> spread<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:23.910> parts<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.510> on

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
now but I've spread your parts out on

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
now but I've spread your parts out on
the<00:00:24.869> floor<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.170> they're<00:00:25.529> easy<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.980> get<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the floor so they're easy to get to in a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630 
the floor so they're easy to get to in a
good<00:00:27.000> order<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.619> first<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.920> start

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
good order and first of all start

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640 
good order and first of all start
putting<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> doors<00:00:30.330> into<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.869> turntable

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
putting the doors into the turntable

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.630 

they're<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> bit<00:00:43.469> wobbly<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.070> stage<00:00:44.340> but

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
they're a bit wobbly at this stage but

00:00:44.640 --> 00:01:02.840 
they're a bit wobbly at this stage but
don't<00:00:44.850> worry<00:01:00.289> now<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.410> will<00:01:01.530> fit<00:01:01.710> home<00:01:01.920> now

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
don't worry now they will fit home now

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
don't worry now they will fit home now
the<00:01:02.910> fisher-price<00:01:03.329> version<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.619> doors<00:01:04.860> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the fisher-price version the doors are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.700 
the fisher-price version the doors are
slightly<00:01:05.610> different<00:01:06.350> they've<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.560> little

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
slightly different they've got little

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.550 
slightly different they've got little
tags<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> top<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.420> interlock<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
tags at the top which interlock in with

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.539 
tags at the top which interlock in with
each<00:01:10.710> other<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.409> fit<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.830> exactly<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
each other but they fit in exactly the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
each other but they fit in exactly the
same<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:18.210> pull<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.320> together<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
same way just pull them together at the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:41.080 
same way just pull them together at the
top

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.859 

like<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:46.609> by<00:01:47.609> next<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> roof

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
like that by next we need the roof

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.550 
like that by next we need the roof
assembly<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.679> together<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> first

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
assembly put together but the first

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
assembly put together but the first
there's<00:01:52.560> two<00:01:52.860> sides<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> left<00:01:53.549> hand<00:01:53.789> side<00:01:54.000> on

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
there's two sides the left hand side on

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
there's two sides the left hand side on
the<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.240> hand<00:01:54.539> side<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.039> tell<00:01:56.310> by<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the right hand side you can tell by the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.959 
the right hand side you can tell by the
extra-long<00:01:57.329> bits<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> sides<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> old

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
extra-long bits the the sides of the old

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.910 
extra-long bits the the sides of the old
one<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.719> what<00:02:01.020> looks<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.289> a<00:02:01.409> couple<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
one have what looks like a couple of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.270 
one have what looks like a couple of
hinges<00:02:02.390> now<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.439> front<00:02:04.740> where

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
hinges now these go at the front where

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.930 
hinges now these go at the front where
the<00:02:05.399> doors<00:02:05.609> fit<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.409> now<00:02:07.409> first<00:02:07.709> of<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.009> take

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the doors fit into now first of all take

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.720 
the doors fit into now first of all take
the<00:02:09.090> left<00:02:09.269> hand<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.979> pick<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> left<00:02:11.489> hand

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the left hand side pick up the left hand

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.949 
the left hand side pick up the left hand
side<00:02:11.970> roof<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:15.980> ease<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.400> together

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
side roof and just ease them together

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.610 
side roof and just ease them together
fit<00:02:18.959> them<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:21.180> tricky<00:02:21.620> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
fit them in this is a bit tricky and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.830 
fit them in this is a bit tricky and
just<00:02:23.459> push<00:02:24.420> them<00:02:24.599> together<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.150> they've<00:02:27.569> got

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
just push them together and they've got

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.380 
just push them together and they've got
your<00:02:27.930> left<00:02:28.110> hand<00:02:28.410> side<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> roof<00:02:29.670> now<00:02:30.329> I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
your left hand side with a roof now I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.569 
your left hand side with a roof now I
then<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.379> hand<00:02:31.410> side<00:02:31.709> do

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
then go on to the right hand side do

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:46.220 
then go on to the right hand side do
exactly<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> same<00:02:33.299> thing<00:02:44.900> yeah<00:02:45.900> when<00:02:46.139> they're

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
exactly the same thing yeah when they're

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.559 
exactly the same thing yeah when they're
nice<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.620> tightly<00:02:46.799> together<00:02:47.269> then<00:02:48.269> we<00:02:48.540> can

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
nice and tightly together then we can

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.759 
nice and tightly together then we can
just<00:02:49.340> slop<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.519> middle<00:02:50.790> roofs<00:02:51.060> together<00:02:53.599> one

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:08.910 

two<00:03:02.000> three<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.380> then<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.560> end<00:03:04.709> roof<00:03:05.010> on

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.530 

and<00:03:09.920> then<00:03:10.040> that's<00:03:10.250> all<00:03:10.400> ready<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:11.240> assemble

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and then that's all ready to assemble

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.900 
and then that's all ready to assemble
onto<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.110> sheds

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
onto the sheds

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.140 
onto the sheds
now<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:13.970> fisher-price<00:03:14.420> version<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.850> slightly

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
now the fisher-price version is slightly

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.000 
now the fisher-price version is slightly
different<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:17.960> there<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.410> no<00:03:18.560> left<00:03:18.830> or

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
different in that there is no left or

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.860 
different in that there is no left or
right<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.580> can<00:03:20.150> use<00:03:20.330> either<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.980> again<00:03:22.870> use

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
right you can use either but again use

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.300 
right you can use either but again use
the<00:03:24.050> left<00:03:24.200> hand<00:03:24.290> piece<00:03:25.120> that's<00:03:26.120> long<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.310> just

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
the left hand piece that's long and just

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.920 
the left hand piece that's long and just
slop<00:03:29.090> together<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> same<00:03:29.960> way<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
slop together in the same way it's the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:04:08.910 
slop together in the same way it's the
left-hand<00:03:33.380> one<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.540> right-hand<00:03:41.960> one

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.740 

and<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:10.040> we<00:04:10.130> are<00:04:10.280> that's<00:04:10.580> ready<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.940> go<00:04:11.240> on<00:04:11.450> as

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
and then we are that's ready to go on as

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.410 
and then we are that's ready to go on as
well<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:18.230> we<00:04:18.770> we<00:04:19.100> do<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.400> final<00:04:19.580> assembly<00:04:19.790> now

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
well but we we do the final assembly now

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.980 
well but we we do the final assembly now
so<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.380> pick<00:04:21.590> your<00:04:21.770> roof<00:04:21.950> section<00:04:22.490> up

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
so if you pick your roof section up

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.500 
so if you pick your roof section up
underneath<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.320> can<00:04:24.530> see<00:04:24.850> these<00:04:25.850> two<00:04:26.180> slots

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
underneath you can see these two slots

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.810 
underneath you can see these two slots
which<00:04:26.840> fit<00:04:27.170> into<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.620> top<00:04:27.830> of<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.040> door<00:04:28.250> now<00:04:28.790> I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
which fit into the top of the door now I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.430 
which fit into the top of the door now I
always<00:04:29.000> try<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.330> line<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.750> middle<00:04:30.020> door<00:04:30.200> up

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
always try and line the middle door up

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.770 
always try and line the middle door up
first<00:04:30.860> on<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.430> five-door<00:04:32.270> version<00:04:34.630> put<00:04:35.630> it

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
first on this five-door version put it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.680 
first on this five-door version put it
down<00:04:36.160> line<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.370> lugs<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.820> just<00:04:38.150> push<00:04:38.450> them

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
down line the lugs and just push them

of the middle one leaving the end ones

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.340 
of the middle one leaving the end ones
just<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.590> push<00:04:48.800> home<00:04:49.450> in<00:04:50.450> ones<00:04:50.810> are<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.170> more

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
just to push home in ones are the more

00:04:51.350 --> 00:05:02.380 
just to push home in ones are the more
tricky<00:04:51.560> one<00:04:59.980> having<00:05:00.980> got<00:05:01.130> those<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.610> we<00:05:02.150> just

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
tricky one having got those in we just

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.420 
tricky one having got those in we just
need<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> side<00:05:02.960> pieces<00:05:03.290> now<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.710> easiest<00:05:04.250> way

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
need the side pieces now the easiest way

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.160 
need the side pieces now the easiest way
to<00:05:04.460> do<00:05:04.820> this<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.490> pull<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.450> side<00:05:08.660> back

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
to do this is to just pull the side back
