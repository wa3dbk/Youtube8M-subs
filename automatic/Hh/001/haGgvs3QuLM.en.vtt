00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.520
 efficient driving is going to 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.200
 allow to save in many ways 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.900
 economical savings greater driving comfort 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.660
 greater security and of course we are going to 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.510
 pollute much less to practice 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.340
 this type of driving we will need a 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.630
 plus anticipation to everything that we 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.019
 surrounds 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.449
 my name is apple tree frame and I'm going to 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.449
 develop in a practical way 10 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.380
 efficient driving tips for 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.380
 share it with you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.070
 for years the self-management engines is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.109
 the energy so prodigiously so 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.230
 currently start an engine to 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.850
 start the march is simply that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.409
 behind are the times when it was 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.930
 it is necessary to heat the motor with 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.640
 accelerate the switchboards of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.769
 feeding the cars of today 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 they make useless that ancient practice 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.750
 as harmful to cold start 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 it is best to start the march as soon as 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 before being soft and letting the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 motor gradually warms up 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.780
 with circular use we have at low 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 revolutions about two or three kilometers 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.470
 until the engine reaches 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.470
 optimum operating temperature 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.840
 except justified cases 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.850
 accelerations should be smooth and 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.880
 progressive to avoid consumption 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.040
 exaggerated the touch of the right foot should 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 be very refined to avoid that 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.690
 interpreter power switches 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.260
 a stomp as an urgent demand for 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.080
 fuel injection in the cylinders 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.030
 also if we step on the bottom and see that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.490
 we have gone we let go of the accelerator 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.670
 the damage to our pocket will already be 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 fact said in another way with our 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 foot we have to speak clear only if 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.400
 we need to accelerate really we will use 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.400
 really 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.390
 anyway the real secret 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.580
 to reduce consumption is to maintain 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.260
 a constant speed of travel is 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.500
 say uniform and without variations 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.720
 considerable speed avoiding 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.759
 losses of kinetic energy and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.880
 making the most of the inertia of the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.160
 risk for that it is convenient to anticipate in 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.670
 every moment to what will happen more 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.770
 go ahead and act accordingly 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 if in front of us there are cars that are 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.569
 detainees will not help us in anything 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.000
 keep the good on the accelerator at 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.099
 otherwise it will make us burn fuel and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.940
 then later we will have to resort to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.550
 the brakes remember the inertia consists 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.290
 in leaving the car without touching the pedals 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.290
 but with a gear geared 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.159
 learn to drive efficiently 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.440
 it is not an impossible task if 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.750
 practices not only save but 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.989
 will drive with greater security and will lengthen 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.269
 The useful life of your vehicle in the next 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 videos we will continue talking about these 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 principles to help you be a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.870
 efficient driver is from our 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 interest that you find the content useful 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.280
 and we await your comments 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.110
 driving school apple the way 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.110
 smart to learn driving
