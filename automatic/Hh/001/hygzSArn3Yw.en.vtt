it can extend beyond other application

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.530 
it can extend beyond other application
types<00:00:48.470> like<00:00:48.740> anything<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.340> would<00:00:49.460> be

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
types like anything that would be

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
quickly toggle to some of the more

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.010 
quickly toggle to some of the more
important<00:01:27.859> components<00:01:28.249> of<00:01:28.340> app<00:01:28.460> space<00:01:29.020> we've

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
important components of app space we've

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.309 
important components of app space we've
got<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.649> media<00:01:31.039> library<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.640> enables

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
got a media library that enables

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.620 
got a media library that enables
customers<00:01:33.319> to<00:01:33.649> upload<00:01:34.549> content<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:35.329> various

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
types to app space and then for

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.649 
types to app space and then for
incorporation<00:01:39.319> into<00:01:39.590> an<00:01:40.100> application

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
incorporation into an application

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.739 
incorporation into an application
living<00:01:42.560> over<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.829> application<00:01:43.399> tab<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:44.689> is

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
living over the application tab this is

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.319 
living over the application tab this is
the<00:01:45.049> most<00:01:45.170> important<00:01:45.590> part<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.549> vapp<00:01:47.030> space

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
the most important part of a vapp space

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.109 
the most important part of a vapp space
obviously<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.499> earlier<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.189> mentioned<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.700> we

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
obviously so earlier I mentioned that we

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.630 
obviously so earlier I mentioned that we
enable<00:01:50.479> people<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.780> create<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.189> manage

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
enable people to create and manage

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.609 
enable people to create and manage
applications<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.289> can<00:01:54.649> do<00:01:54.829> that<00:01:56.619> by

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
applications so you can do that by

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.139 
applications so you can do that by
clicking<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.399> Edit<00:02:00.340> component<00:02:01.340> here<00:02:01.549> and

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
clicking the Edit component here and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.639 
clicking the Edit component here and
what<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.390> see<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.599> a<00:02:02.780> wire<00:02:03.049> frame<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
what you see is a wire frame of the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.520 
what you see is a wire frame of the
application<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.429> this<00:02:04.579> is<00:02:04.700> very<00:02:04.929> simple<00:02:05.929> it's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
application so this is very simple it's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.580 
application so this is very simple it's
modular<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.250> people<00:02:07.759> are<00:02:07.909> used<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.530> kind<00:02:09.530> of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
modular and people are used to kind of

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.650 
modular and people are used to kind of
seeing<00:02:09.860> an<00:02:10.250> application<00:02:10.910> laid<00:02:11.090> out<00:02:11.239> like<00:02:11.269> this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
seeing an application laid out like this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.740 
seeing an application laid out like this
as<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.560> toggle<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.010> mouse<00:02:13.190> over<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:14.480> media
