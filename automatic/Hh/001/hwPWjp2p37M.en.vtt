don't feel like using a hairdryer and I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.970 
don't feel like using a hairdryer and I
was<00:00:30.809> planning<00:00:31.169> on<00:00:31.200> including<00:00:31.680> three

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
was planning on including three

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.520 
was planning on including three
hairstyles<00:00:32.460> instead<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.050> was

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
hairstyles instead of just two but I was

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.630 
hairstyles instead of just two but I was
trying<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> third<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.520> I'm

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
trying to do the third one and I'm

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
trying to do the third one and I'm
really<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.149> good<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.420> hair<00:00:36.719> stuff<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
really not good at hair stuff so I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.930 
really not good at hair stuff so I
always<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.010> simple<00:00:38.250> things<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
always do like really simple things and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.160 
always do like really simple things and
the<00:00:39.059> third<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.390> wasn't<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.809> working<00:00:40.079> out

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the third one wasn't really working out

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
the third one wasn't really working out
so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> decided<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.309> stop<00:00:42.120> while<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so I decided to just stop while I was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.209 
so I decided to just stop while I was
ahead<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> show<00:00:43.289> you<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
ahead and to show you these two because

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
ahead and to show you these two because
the<00:00:44.700> third<00:00:44.880> one<00:00:45.060> probably<00:00:45.090> wouldn't<00:00:45.570> have

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the third one probably wouldn't have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
the third one probably wouldn't have
turned<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.990> very<00:00:46.020> good<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.829> super

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
just do the same thing like I'm doing

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
just do the same thing like I'm doing
here<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.940> can<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.330> see<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.659> doing

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
here you can kind of see what I'm doing

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
here you can kind of see what I'm doing
here

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.770 

so<00:01:36.340> as<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.610> work<00:01:36.729> down<00:01:36.970> my<00:01:37.150> hair<00:01:37.360> I'm<00:01:37.570> just

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
so as I work down my hair I'm just

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.590 
so as I work down my hair I'm just
grabbing<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.500> little<00:01:38.770> bit<00:01:39.070> less<00:01:39.640> hair<00:01:40.210> from

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
grabbing a little bit less hair from

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.539 
grabbing a little bit less hair from
each<00:01:40.780> section<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.040> allows<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.460> to

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
each section and this just allows it to

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.249 
each section and this just allows it to
be<00:01:42.640> thicker<00:01:42.939> at<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.210> top<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:43.930> as<00:01:44.110> it

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
be thicker at the top and then as it

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.969 
be thicker at the top and then as it
goes<00:01:44.380> down<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.920> gets<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.159> little<00:01:45.369> bit<00:01:45.460> thinner

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
goes down it gets a little bit thinner
