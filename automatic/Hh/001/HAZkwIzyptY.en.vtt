00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
there is an explosive device up there so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
there is an explosive device up there so
watch<00:00:56.460> I'll<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.820> lean<00:00:57.239> forward<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:58.230> up

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
watch I'll really lean forward get up

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
watch I'll really lean forward get up
there<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.559> wheelie<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> explosive

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
there and wheelie over the explosive

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
there and wheelie over the explosive
device<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> best<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
device and that is the best way to get a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.740 
device and that is the best way to get a
fat<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:03.000> part<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> another<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.719> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
fat and this part is another one of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
fat and this part is another one of
those<00:01:03.899> tricky<00:01:04.290> parks<00:01:04.589> because<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.220> land

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
those tricky parks because if you land

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
those tricky parks because if you land
on<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.880> wheel<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> start

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
on this wheel it's going to start

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
on this wheel it's going to start
spinning<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> spinning<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> start<00:01:08.729> like

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
spinning and spinning if you start like

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
spinning and spinning if you start like
a<00:01:08.970> struggling<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> i<00:01:10.350> should<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a struggling on it i should say and that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.859 
a struggling on it i should say and that
kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> applies<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.299> these<00:01:12.570> wheels

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
kind of applies for all these wheels

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
kind of applies for all these wheels
except<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> last<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> be

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
except for the last one so you got to be

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.920 
except for the last one so you got to be
really<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.270> careful<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
really really really careful on the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
really really really careful on the
wheels<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.490> part<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.880> here

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
wheels and then on this part right here

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
wheels and then on this part right here
you<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> jump<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> barrels

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you just got to jump up on the barrels

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
you just got to jump up on the barrels
try<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.250> back<00:01:20.520> tire<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.299> as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
try to get your back tire on there as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
try to get your back tire on there as
much<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.840> possible<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.500> then<00:01:22.560> again<00:01:23.189> bunnyhop

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
much as possible and then again bunnyhop

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.890 
much as possible and then again bunnyhop
of<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.450> there's<00:01:24.630> another

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of that because there's another

to bunny hop over this section and it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.749 
to bunny hop over this section and it
really<00:02:04.469> won't<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> justice<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.729> mean

jump right into these extreme tracks now

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
jump right into these extreme tracks now
it's<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.690> take<00:02:12.840> some<00:02:12.870> practice<00:02:13.170> you're

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's going to take some practice you're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.080 
it's going to take some practice you're
gonna<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.250> beat<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> beginner<00:02:14.790> tracks

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
gonna have to beat the beginner tracks

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.070 
gonna have to beat the beginner tracks
you're<00:02:15.210> gonna<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.570> beat<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> easy

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you're gonna have to beat the easy

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.450 
you're gonna have to beat the easy
tracks<00:02:16.500> you're<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> beat<00:02:17.310> the

tracks you're going to have to beat the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.490 
tracks you're going to have to beat the
hard<00:02:17.640> tracks<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.600> you'll<00:02:19.080> practice

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
hard tracks and then you'll practice

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.260 
hard tracks and then you'll practice
enough<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.890> you'll<00:02:19.980> get<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> these<00:02:20.460> levels

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
enough and you'll get to these levels

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.450 
enough and you'll get to these levels
that<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:21.690> extreme<00:02:22.320> like<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.710> inferno<00:02:23.070> track

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
that are extreme like the inferno track

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.480 
that are extreme like the inferno track
and<00:02:23.700> will<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.120> lose<00:02:24.710> I'm<00:02:25.710> not<00:02:25.950> lose<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.370> will

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
and will be lose I'm not lose you will

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.950 
and will be lose I'm not lose you will
use<00:02:26.730> all<00:02:26.760> these<00:02:27.330> skills<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.780> learned

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
use all these skills you learned

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.780 
use all these skills you learned
previously<00:02:28.290> while<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.160> were<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.520> hard

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
previously while you were on these hard

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790 
previously while you were on these hard
tracks<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.270> everything<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.740> said

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
tracks and everything so like I said

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
tracks and everything so like I said
this<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.130> another<00:02:32.460> one<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.670> those<00:02:32.790> bunny<00:02:33.120> hop

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
this is another one of those bunny hop

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.880 
this is another one of those bunny hop
parts<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.720> got<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> funny<00:02:34.110> hop<00:02:34.260> off<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.740> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
parts you got a funny hop off there and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.560 
parts you got a funny hop off there and
I<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.460> lucky<00:02:35.790> enough<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.240> checkpoint

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
I was lucky enough to get a checkpoint

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.760 
I was lucky enough to get a checkpoint
right<00:02:36.750> there<00:02:36.810> which<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.140> really<00:02:37.380> think<00:02:37.620> I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
right there which I really think I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530 
right there which I really think I
wasn't<00:02:37.950> gonna<00:02:38.070> get<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.360> another

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
wasn't gonna get and this is another

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.180 
wasn't gonna get and this is another
technique<00:02:39.840> used<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.530> part<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.040> went

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
technique used on that part I just went

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.350 
technique used on that part I just went
over<00:02:41.250> its<00:02:41.400> called<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> bounce<00:02:41.850> technique

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
over its called a bounce technique

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.030 
over its called a bounce technique

try to go back down and I got another
fault<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.250> these<00:03:11.880> extreme<00:03:12.300> tracks<00:03:12.570> where

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
fault so it's these extreme tracks where

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.240 
fault so it's these extreme tracks where
you<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.170> got<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.440> be<00:03:13.530> very<00:03:13.560> very<00:03:13.920> careful

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
you really got to be very very careful

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
you really got to be very very careful
and<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.610> got<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:14.910> easy<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.480> sticks<00:03:15.750> or

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and you got to be easy on the sticks or

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.570 
and you got to be easy on the sticks or
else<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:16.530> gonna<00:03:16.590> fall<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:16.950> certain<00:03:17.370> parts

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
else you're gonna fall on certain parts

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.430 
else you're gonna fall on certain parts
so<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.720> end<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> track<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.320> go

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
so this is the end of the track you go

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.380 
so this is the end of the track you go
up<00:03:19.560> here<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.010> then<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:20.580> was<00:03:20.940> another<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.300> of

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
up here and then this was another one of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.940 
up here and then this was another one of
those<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.630> gotta<00:03:21.780> go<00:03:21.900> lean<00:03:22.110> back<00:03:22.290> bunny<00:03:22.739> hop

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
