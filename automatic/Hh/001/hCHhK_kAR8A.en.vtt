been wanting to have sting come back for
a<00:00:19.199> while<00:00:19.439> now<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.070> guess<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> event<00:00:21.060> just

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
a while now I guess the event just

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.990 
a while now I guess the event just
wasn't<00:00:21.660> big<00:00:21.810> enough<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.560> SummerSlam<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.189> w.e

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
wasn't big enough but SummerSlam is w.e

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
wasn't big enough but SummerSlam is w.e
second<00:00:24.480> biggest<00:00:24.660> event<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> year<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
second biggest event of the year and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
second biggest event of the year and
this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> definitely<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.180> great<00:00:27.390> time<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> have

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
this is definitely a great time to have

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.880 
this is definitely a great time to have
sting<00:00:28.769> come<00:00:29.070> back<00:00:29.449> now<00:00:30.449> apparently<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.560> run

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sting come back now apparently this run

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.150 
sting come back now apparently this run
is<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:33.059> built<00:00:33.930> upon<00:00:34.140> setting<00:00:35.010> up

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

week as in the Undertaker is scheduled

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.620 
week as in the Undertaker is scheduled
to<00:01:17.220> appear<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> made<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> video<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to appear as well I made a video on that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.649 
to appear as well I made a video on that
but<00:01:19.409> maybe<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.150> setup<00:01:21.450> for

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
but maybe this is just the setup for

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
but maybe this is just the setup for
wrestlemania<00:01:22.140> 32<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> best-case

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
wrestlemania 32 but the best-case

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
wrestlemania 32 but the best-case
scenario<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.080> sting<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.680> match<00:01:25.830> at

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
scenario is we have sting in a match at

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.530 
scenario is we have sting in a match at
SummerSlam<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.060> honest<00:01:27.360> that's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
SummerSlam and to be honest that's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
SummerSlam and to be honest that's
honestly<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
honestly the way that I think it's going

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880 
honestly the way that I think it's going
to<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> either<00:01:30.659> against<00:01:31.200> Bray<00:01:31.409> Wyatt<00:01:31.439> or

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
to go either against Bray Wyatt or

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
to go either against Bray Wyatt or
against<00:01:32.340> Triple<00:01:32.640> H<00:01:32.790> round<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.720> think

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
against Triple H round two and I think

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.740 
against Triple H round two and I think
this<00:01:34.140> time<00:01:34.200> sting<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> victory

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
this time sting will get the victory

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
this time sting will get the victory
also<00:01:36.750> how<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> could<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.310> staying<00:01:38.820> vs.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
also how it could go down is staying vs.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
also how it could go down is staying vs.
Triple<00:01:39.450> H<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:40.049> SummerSlam<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.549> get

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
Triple H at SummerSlam and then we get

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
Triple H at SummerSlam and then we get
sting<00:01:41.970> vs.<00:01:42.299> Triple<00:01:42.479> H<00:01:42.720> again<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.200> Survivor

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
