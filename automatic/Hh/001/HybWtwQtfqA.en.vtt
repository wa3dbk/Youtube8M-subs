00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
the bosses and stuff we have in there

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.009 
the bosses and stuff we have in there
but<00:03:51.250> i<00:03:51.280> hope<00:03:51.880> i<00:03:52.150> hope<00:03:52.389> that<00:03:52.569> there's<00:03:52.720> some<00:03:52.900> way

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
but i hope i hope that there's some way

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.629 
but i hope i hope that there's some way
that<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.230> 22<00:03:53.650> games<00:03:53.829> can<00:03:53.980> coexist<00:03:54.220> because

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
that the 22 games can coexist because

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.460 
that the 22 games can coexist because
it's<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> music<00:03:55.359> game<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.870> music<00:03:56.290> rhythm

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's just a music game you music rhythm

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.860 
it's just a music game you music rhythm
game<00:03:56.650> space<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.190> i<00:03:57.250> think<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.519> really

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
game space but i think it's really

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.819 
game space but i think it's really
unexplored<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.109> great<00:03:59.319> degree<00:03:59.470> like

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
unexplored to a great degree like

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.199 
unexplored to a great degree like
there's<00:04:00.040> lots<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.459> first-person<00:04:00.819> shooters

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
there's lots of first-person shooters

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.400 
there's lots of first-person shooters
out<00:04:01.299> there<00:04:01.359> there's<00:04:01.690> lots<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.930> action<00:04:02.109> games

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
out there there's lots of action games

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.199 
out there there's lots of action games
but<00:04:02.590> really<00:04:02.769> music<00:04:03.430> rhythm<00:04:03.579> games<00:04:03.819> there's

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
but really music rhythm games there's

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.309 
but really music rhythm games there's
not<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.389> lot<00:04:04.569> out<00:04:04.600> there<00:04:04.750> hopefully<00:04:05.109> the

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
not a lot out there hopefully the

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.990 
not a lot out there hopefully the
chickens<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:06.040> coexist

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.270
