00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.650
 Unfortunately, the assets can not be found with tracking systems 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.650
 but so you never have a cell phone with you can allegedly find any time 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.810
 For worried parents, a calming thought makes their children in 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.050
 But knowing that these systems work is as good as security 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.939
 promised 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 Plusminus has tested two different offers 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.970
 at night and 2 in a village near Trier at family meter it still has not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 the parents are worried the 17-year-old Tim is longer again 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.720
 from and not available on his mobile for netbooks 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.420
 dpa 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
 TV Harheim 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.809
 thick air 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:45.930
 no wonder 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.690
 Little Annika does not care about her parents, but she does not 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 could still come 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.270
 Location services on the Internet want parents to take these fears for the next generation 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.420
 they claim the fear that they can locate on their phones at any time 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.350
 can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.590
 I've almost reached family Meter tests Fürth ots - two systems there 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.430
 M and Annika increasingly take two cell phones on a walk together 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.970
 the parents stay at the computer with the youngest Knox and try 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.290
 to locate the other two via the directory inquiry services 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 For this they have to register on the internet, in our case 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.700
 on the side of check-in Kate 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.080
 and then pay to set up a prepaid account, for example, it costs 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 around 20 euros from the third time each location between 75 cents and one euro 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.109
 the daily Schullandheim League will monitor his kids 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.870
 So it would be up to 40 euros per month 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.780
 by the way 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.250
 the location of persons without their consent while unlawful 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.550
 We know Kim and Annika and are meanwhile in the village 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.050
 Parents can find them with the help of a mobile phone and a computer mouse click 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.220
 and seconds later the result is on the screen 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.980
 a list of roads on the map is a spot marked are the children 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.220
 really lasts 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.660
 Make helpers 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.880
 a good quarter more 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.609
 around the grave in the small playground 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.609
 the last record with another job 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.309
 So not where he be but 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.919
 NNP percent below the Johannesstraße in the forest 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.849
 meanwhile circulating 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.279
 that would be part of the way for us so that's for nonsense 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.339
 if they were traveling with the mobile phone at the ceremony 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.440
 under the shoes 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.809
 longer time 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:32.609
 Niederhausen the municipality would look for her clearly 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.149
 then we would not go wrong now 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:39.219
 The first full moon on Good Friday Wood and running across the place did that 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.299
 System continues to display a location on the edge of the forest 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.269
 Given the fees incurred, no particularly helpful result 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.919
 and 11 we show our kids super the mobile phone experts of the magazine 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.860
 "Connect" have already done similar tests and his own 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.499
 Explanation why the system is not accurate the children's whereabouts 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.599
 could determine 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.419
 the feedback that percent of the TV is located on the mobile radio cells 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.199
 and the accuracy keeps clarified that eleven days ago 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.489
 and it could still tell in town that I'm a year old Kirdorf 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.870
 actually one kilometer further away than it is them 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.129
 is shown by the system 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.189
 second attempt of Google's free location service 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.059
 Ultimately, held to German riding degree means this time we want to pull and 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.409
 Find Annika on a business phone 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.239
 on it and on the computer of the parents runs the program 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.550
 Lastly, Shield will become friends and relatives around the world 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.209
 Find 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.909
 To do this, you must first agree to the release of your data by e-mail 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 noticed that everything is already done 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.829
 in the place at the time 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.529
 Tim and Annika complicate and the search 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 they go to a supermarket 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.810
 we could still place you percent though 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.969
 in the building since then, and that very precisely 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.589
 as exactly as before 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.809
 Hit the reason the phone worked much like a 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.939
 navigation device 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.259
 The Corners percent eu-laws to 2% of the piece that's consistently Reuters 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.120
 To be detrimental then say electricity consumers hear in the dark and 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.459
 faster empty advantage is the location is percent more accurate 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.750
 They can be up to about ten feet exactly where the signal can be though 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.790
 also by dense foliage or houses ravines of falsified 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.760
 be or completely tear off the last game for free 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.550
 but using the service uses communicates over the internet and can ever do so 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.360
 after contract and provider only costs arise 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.550
 from the crisis or inaccurate by antenna or satellite once detected 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.110
 Whereabouts are then no longer known only to the telephone network provider 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.770
 but also the tracking service and could fall into the wrong hands 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.099
 you could also imagine 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.319
 Elena that employers come to such data with percent all possibilities 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.870
 which are associated with it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.199
 I would think so far exactly synonymous if I 1 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.379
 around parents part 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.379
 make such data available in principle 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.110
 and how does our test family see that they will want to use the services 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.780
 Structure Solution Millions of people grew up anyway José Holebas 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.309
 the system was already checked on Monday 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:17.689
 and that should be for 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.189
 Our children work well if everyone knows where I am 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.719
 For me, thoughts are so pleasant for me 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:26.370
 and that will 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.270
 Nothing new makes sure "Somehow this has to be different Manfred Fischer 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.889
 and publications of the order 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.020
 that is really a matter of trust and of 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.040
 then you just have to take customers rather different percent come clearly the next 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.039
 Trip to the phone back up to the phone and surfing the Internet 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.750
 big brother of a hand is a liter anyway much dearer it is
