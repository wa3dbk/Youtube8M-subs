00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.690
 our future is going to be the artist going to the world cup two going around 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 a report that fifa would be considering withdrawing the event in Brazil 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.589
 and what I want to say is that today I make vows I really can 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 Why does this really happen? 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.099
 I wanted to even launch a campaign 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.499
 fifa goes away from the cup of Brazil 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.759
 this basically two reasons 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.509
 the first of them 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.279
 I think any Brazilian concerned 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.689
 with a distinctive 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.630
 of surgery 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240
 bears your taxes 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.490
 I should already have a good reason I'm going to laugh, I would rather the world cup were 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.090
 though 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.290
 this kind of world cup olympic event ended up always serving 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.319
 like a big 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.440
 justification a great excuse 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.359
 for governments to move forward even more 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.080
 our pockets 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.929
 since then the need 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.109
 of spending is starting from box at christmas yesterday with every time since forever 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.070
 for the last hour without due clarification to be able to supply the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.750
 seek even more to come back 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.670
 the age 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 then any Brazilian concerned about the excessive public expenses 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.719
 and with the robbery 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.189
 this symbiosis for example of government contractors already has a reason enough 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.640
 reasonable 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.680
 It has been noted that the canopy leaves 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 to another country 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.880
 hacker 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.500
 but we have it right 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.880
 that the olympics in greece in athens 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.530
 since then 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.570
 is well and will become 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.010
 but life is like this 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.870
 was the case of marcelo bonan already had a trend of improvement and 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.490
 own in the city to ears the ears only catalysts type of thing 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.680
 tickets in greece england expects support 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.010
 the crap of the event 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.040
 every postal charge is paid today 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.270
 part of these public forest expenditures is a portion tied to this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.179
 then it is not true that this kind of event the beneficial price rapper ages 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.890
 no because 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 really believed 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.500
 in the body of the l do you think that in May 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.970
 the actor in a blink of an eye a change of conduct of Socrates government to have 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.519
 lied 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.940
 rep in the world ensuring from night to day then 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.910
 what has not happened so far that I will stay a little bit of the outside world 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.309
 political 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.360
 we had a break and we ended up staying 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.280
 and saw what happened overpriced excessive spending 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.319
 very bad 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.749
 I remember things and long after the actual help in the country's infrastructure 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:36.989
 anything 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.200
 in the then the first point is this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.349
 the second point is the following I can not deny that it gives me a certain debauchery 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.809
 ericeira and the petralhas being humiliated 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:52.619
 insert five very very tasty I can not anderson is to converse 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.319
 it would be very nice to see 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.900
 this kind of worldwide humiliation 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770
 for this show life mainly because the diogo 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.620
 who tries to sell until today the image of him had people in the management 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.380
 It's a joke that never had anything 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.820
 concrete to be delivered in this regard. 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.060
 but winning in life half a percent of intervening my house my life and so forth 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.780
 goes and until today is the thesis that is an efficient manager 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.610
 meanwhile the holder gives the story 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.499
 totally worth nothing 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.579
 the country 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.079
 would it be if they liked to hear they broke their face at this magnitude then these two 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.289
 crime generation grounds 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.609
 that's enough 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.249
 What to thank him for? 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:42.559
 that fifa really has something the act of common sense 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.640
 This will take world cup. 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.760
 of Brazil 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.029
 Why do we only have to win with this? 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:53.589
 has a tour that will have to retreat slept tumbled nonetheless friends 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:58.500
 contractors ii everybody is involved in this symbiosis of robbery 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.499
 I refuse the minister already taken 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.730
 nationalist good rock né 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.239
 it has been said in the past that nationalism is the last refuge 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.370
 from the corpse 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.879
 teenager left the humanity and things like 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.620
 the care of those 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.840
 I am one of those people who take effect immediately 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.910
 and intelligent 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.960
 lucas france indicated the organizers the pilot could enter 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.180
 Brazil Brazil Brazil is sweet 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.860

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.830
 costs 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.349
 It's from this boogeyness my mouth all they want is could come in with 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.349
 actions passions weapons in own country 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.370
 he denied however on the other side of the equation 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.620
 it was 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.330
 what we saw was a great pro-government gala and team back off 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.379
 bread and circus in romania 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.040
 kieza authorities always knew how to explore 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.969
 in the conference and the coliseum of the port and sp 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.760
 - in certain 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.879
 close to 7 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.590
 who can I shout your brazil brazil with your head 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.749
 since the morning and then leave 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.740
 everything the government does against its freedoms against 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.479
 however this class 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.580
 really do not want to lose it is not enough anymore and maybe 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.719
 novels domingão do faustão now even what it represents in various forms 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.260
 disaster person placard 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.630
 Your life on Mars 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.050
 a wheelchair is going to ask for the crime is thus arts and literatures and then a 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.879
 little more 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:36.789
 - maybe but at last I'm only sorry but I actually talked with cheering for that 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:37.749
 you 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.139
 I have to find a way and India 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.789
 is to channel the debut of proof or 3g 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.090
 artur moraes 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.830
 why this escape was not mixed this nationalistic escape good bit it costs 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.830
 very expensive for Brazilians in general 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.699
 my own pocket 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:57.950
 in all those 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.930
 What would you like to see the mussulo? 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.089
 of its resources 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.330
 a little more rational in a country that has so much misery 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.550
 both diversion of resource so much corruption 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.430
 and so much concentration of cases 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.900
 in the hands of the government 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.710
 So 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.160
 let's launch this fifa sim campaign take the world cup in good time 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.889
 Brazil 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.030
 that there is someone who was right about the relatives 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.499
 it was the chance of a goal 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.529
 when you stepped in here and say 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.259
 and this is not a country
