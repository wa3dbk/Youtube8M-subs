00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
one pound 12 ounces and five eighths so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.349 
one pound 12 ounces and five eighths so
that's<00:02:15.269> what<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.659> for<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:15.959> harvest

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.009 

this<00:02:21.359> little<00:02:21.599> one<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:23.150> actually<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.390> green

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
this little one here is actually a green

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.929 
this little one here is actually a green
when<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.260> plucked<00:02:25.500> early<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.579> thought<00:02:26.730> there

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
when we plucked early we thought there

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.399 
when we plucked early we thought there
might<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.150> been<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.390> worm<00:02:27.689> or<00:02:27.870> something<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
might have been a worm or something in

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.740 
might have been a worm or something in
there<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.159> it<00:02:29.310> turns<00:02:29.549> out<00:02:29.760> after<00:02:30.299> we<00:02:30.389> cut<00:02:30.599> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there but it turns out after we cut it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.240 
there but it turns out after we cut it
it<00:02:31.230> was<00:02:31.349> just<00:02:31.379> where<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.769> was<00:02:31.859> sitting<00:02:32.069> on

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
it was just where it was sitting on

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.280 
it was just where it was sitting on
another<00:02:32.549> tomato<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.269> not<00:02:33.599> getting<00:02:33.780> Sun<00:02:34.079> and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
another tomato and not getting Sun and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
another tomato and not getting Sun and
rubbing<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.609> was<00:02:35.909> also<00:02:36.090> cut

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
rubbing it there so that was also cut

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.539 
rubbing it there so that was also cut
off<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:37.139> was<00:02:37.260> our<00:02:37.409> fault<00:02:37.650> we're<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.459> go

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
off that was our fault we're going to go

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.369 
off that was our fault we're going to go
ahead<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.030> take<00:02:39.150> care<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> ripening<00:02:40.200> these

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
ahead and take care of ripening these

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.940 
ahead and take care of ripening these
now<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.489> what<00:02:41.639> we<00:02:41.730> want<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:43.200> ripen<00:02:43.799> them

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
now so what we want to do to ripen them

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.670 
now so what we want to do to ripen them
is<00:02:44.129> put<00:02:44.370> them<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.639> a<00:02:44.819> paper<00:02:45.150> bag<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:46.500> don't

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is put them in a paper bag you don't

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.409 
is put them in a paper bag you don't
want<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:46.919> in<00:02:47.010> too<00:02:47.220> big<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.489> paper<00:02:47.790> bag<00:02:48.060> because

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
want it in too big a paper bag because

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.960 
want it in too big a paper bag because
it'll<00:02:48.930> take<00:02:49.109> too<00:02:49.319> long<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.889> gases<00:02:50.370> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it'll take too long for the gases to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.059 
it'll take too long for the gases to
affect<00:02:51.419> it<00:02:51.629> so<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.139> want<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.409> just<00:02:52.709> big<00:02:53.040> enough

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
affect it so you want it just big enough

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.920 
affect it so you want it just big enough
that<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.519> fits<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.299> tight<00:02:54.599> squeeze

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that it fits it's not a tight squeeze

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.830 
that it fits it's not a tight squeeze
