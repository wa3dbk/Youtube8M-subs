would<00:04:34.550> be<00:04:34.610> play<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.690> with<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.520> changing<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:38.349> and

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
would be play it with the changing a and

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.460 
would be play it with the changing a and
e<00:04:39.919> base<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:41.569> a<00:04:41.599> string<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.139> here<00:04:44.289> and<00:04:45.289> then

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
e base a the a string is here and then

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:56.450 
e base a the a string is here and then
the<00:04:45.500> e<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.949> base<00:04:49.130> and

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:07.110 

and<00:04:56.940> here<00:04:57.240> you<00:04:57.300> have<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.570> rhythm

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540 

when<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.150> play<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.600> D<00:05:08.810> major<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.350> played<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.800> and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
play B and the E string here is the B

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.260 
play B and the E string here is the B
that<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:25.630> will<00:05:26.950> play<00:05:27.950> with<00:05:28.130> my<00:05:28.370> middle<00:05:28.910> finger

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
that I will play with my middle finger

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:45.220 
that I will play with my middle finger
of<00:05:29.420> the<00:05:29.450> left<00:05:29.600> hand<00:05:29.870> yeah<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:34.210> once<00:05:35.210> again<00:05:44.230> okay

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
of the left hand yeah so once again okay

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.010 
of the left hand yeah so once again okay
this<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:45.950> one<00:05:46.220> idea<00:05:46.730> or<00:05:46.790> another<00:05:47.120> idea<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.600> play

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
this is one idea or another idea to play

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.670 
this is one idea or another idea to play
it<00:05:48.260> is<00:05:48.560> if<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:50.000> want<00:05:50.300> to<00:05:50.690> play<00:05:51.170> it<00:05:51.230> with<00:05:51.470> your

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
it is if you want to play it with your

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.730 
it is if you want to play it with your
fingers<00:05:52.220> in<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.520> right<00:05:52.730> hand<00:05:53.200> use<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:55.270> bass

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
fingers in the right hand use the bass

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.860 
fingers in the right hand use the bass
they<00:05:57.740> use<00:05:57.920> the<00:05:58.100> thumb<00:05:58.430> for<00:05:58.730> the<00:05:58.820> a<00:05:58.850> string<00:05:59.450> and

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
they use the thumb for the a string and

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.130 
they use the thumb for the a string and
I<00:06:00.680> keep<00:06:00.890> these<00:06:01.340> three<00:06:01.760> things<00:06:02.060> together<00:06:02.450> with

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
I keep these three things together with

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.940 
I keep these three things together with
them<00:06:03.320> on<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.590> G<00:06:03.860> B<00:06:04.250> and<00:06:04.430> E<00:06:04.700> string<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.800> like

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
them on the G B and E string and it like

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.860 
them on the G B and E string and it like
this<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:10.580> then<00:06:10.730> I<00:06:10.850> can<00:06:11.090> change<00:06:11.360> the<00:06:11.660> base

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
this and then I can change the base

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:27.519 
this and then I can change the base
things

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:27.529 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:40.219 

so<00:06:28.529> you<00:06:28.589> have<00:06:28.969> the<00:06:29.969> motion<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.479> base<00:06:39.050> this<00:06:40.050> is

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
so you have the motion the base this is

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:46.809 
so you have the motion the base this is
another<00:06:40.529> idea<00:06:40.949> I<00:06:42.439> play<00:06:43.459> thumb<00:06:45.589> forefinger

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
another idea I play thumb forefinger

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.429 
another idea I play thumb forefinger
thumb<00:06:47.819> for<00:06:48.089> the<00:06:48.179> g<00:06:48.360> string<00:06:48.659> middle<00:06:49.259> finger

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
thumb for the g string middle finger

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:56.499 
thumb for the g string middle finger
fully<00:06:49.949> string<00:06:50.429> a<00:06:52.399> G<00:06:53.399> and<00:06:53.479> E<00:06:54.479> string<00:06:54.839> thumb

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
fully string a G and E string thumb

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:03.769 
fully string a G and E string thumb
forefinger<00:06:57.509> firm
