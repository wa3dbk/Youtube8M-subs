soaking up the oil

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.289 
soaking up the oil
from<00:03:32.140> his<00:03:32.260> skin<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:32.739> taking<00:03:33.219> off<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:34.180> know

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
from his skin it's taking off you know

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.240 
from his skin it's taking off you know
whatever<00:03:34.659> it<00:03:34.840> can<00:03:35.079> that's<00:03:35.409> what<00:03:35.530> oxidizing<00:03:36.129> is

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
whatever it can that's what oxidizing is

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.220 
whatever it can that's what oxidizing is
it's<00:03:36.459> sucking<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:37.120> off<00:03:37.239> everything<00:03:37.719> that<00:03:37.900> can

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
it's sucking in off everything that can

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.039 
it's sucking in off everything that can
because<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:39.280> enriching<00:03:39.730> itself<00:03:40.390> enriching

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
because it's enriching itself enriching

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.890 
because it's enriching itself enriching
into<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.379> leather<00:03:42.030> which<00:03:43.030> i<00:03:43.299> think<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.659> kind

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
into the leather which i think is kind

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.160 
into the leather which i think is kind
of<00:03:43.959> beautiful<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:45.510> probably<00:03:46.510> should<00:03:46.810> learn<00:03:47.109> a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
of beautiful I probably should learn a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.569 
of beautiful I probably should learn a
bit<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.319> a<00:03:47.469> germaphobe<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.250> there's<00:03:48.430> probably

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
bit of a germaphobe so there's probably

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.000 
bit of a germaphobe so there's probably
a<00:03:48.909> ton<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.269> germs<00:03:49.659> on<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:49.959> bag<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.769> lot<00:03:50.980> of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
a ton of germs on this bag but a lot of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.129 
a ton of germs on this bag but a lot of
bags<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.760> very<00:03:52.030> dirty<00:03:52.299> because<00:03:52.659> you<00:03:52.810> put<00:03:53.019> them

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
bags are very dirty because you put them

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.319 
bags are very dirty because you put them
in<00:03:53.230> places<00:03:53.469> so<00:03:53.889> always<00:03:54.549> trying<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:54.939> hang<00:03:55.150> your

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
back see the color of - it is probably a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.300 
back see the color of - it is probably a
little<00:04:01.180> bit<00:04:01.540> darker<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.079> I'll<00:04:02.409> hold<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.739> up<00:04:02.889> and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
little bit darker so I'll hold it up and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.149 
little bit darker so I'll hold it up and
sort<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:03.939> see<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:05.109> can<00:04:05.290> see<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.680> versus

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
sort of see that you can see it versus

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.720 
sort of see that you can see it versus
the<00:04:06.340> nude<00:04:07.260> that's<00:04:08.260> not<00:04:08.530> new<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.980> when<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.489> get

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
the nude that's not new so when you get

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.640 
the nude that's not new so when you get
it<00:04:09.879> it's<00:04:10.060> originally<00:04:10.540> wider<00:04:10.930> than<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.379> and

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
it it's originally wider than that and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.559
