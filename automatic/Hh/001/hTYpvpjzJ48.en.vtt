tribe<00:00:13.259> level<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:14.219> made<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> pree<00:00:15.030> saved

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
tribe level I have made a pree saved

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.849 
tribe level I have made a pree saved
game<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.410> jump<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:16.680> into

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
game here that so we can jump right into

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.109 
game here that so we can jump right into
the<00:00:17.039> action<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.900> see<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.529> dig<00:00:19.740> into<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
the action as you can see you dig into a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.390 
the action as you can see you dig into a
save<00:00:21.119> game<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.660> Galaxy<00:00:22.279> somebody<00:00:23.279> has

save game in your Galaxy somebody has

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
save game in your Galaxy somebody has
made<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> robot<00:00:24.029> creature<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.750> surprisingly

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
made a robot creature that surprisingly

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740 
made a robot creature that surprisingly
moves<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> robot<00:00:26.160> which<00:00:26.760> even<00:00:27.359> surprises

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
moves like a robot which even surprises

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.480 
moves like a robot which even surprises
us<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> development<00:00:28.439> team<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.949> we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
us on the development team because we

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
us on the development team because we
don't<00:00:29.670> make<00:00:29.880> robots<00:00:30.390> specific<00:00:30.810> animations

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
don't make robots specific animations

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't make robots specific animations
people<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.009> figured<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.460> using<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
people have figured out using the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
people have figured out using the
physics<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.980> employ<00:00:35.160> using<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> certain

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
physics that we employ using a certain

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.670 
physics that we employ using a certain
animations<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.930> basic<00:00:37.260> animations<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
animations that we basic animations that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
animations that we basic animations that
we<00:00:37.829> made<00:00:38.270> how<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> configure<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> creatures

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
we made how to configure the creatures

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
we made how to configure the creatures
such<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:40.770> can<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.129> certain<00:00:41.640> movements

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
such that they can get certain movements

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.610 
such that they can get certain movements
tiles<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.410> trigger

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
tiles out of it that how you can trigger

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
tiles out of it that how you can trigger
certain<00:00:43.920> animation<00:00:44.489> styles<00:00:44.789> now<00:00:45.920> we're<00:00:46.920> going

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
certain animation styles now we're going

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.889 
certain animation styles now we're going
to<00:00:47.100> start<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> game<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.950> our<00:00:49.950> load<00:00:50.250> bar<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
to start the game up and our load bar is

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.459 
to start the game up and our load bar is
actually<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:53.719> list<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.870> creatures<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
actually a list of creatures that you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually a list of creatures that you
might<00:00:55.649> encounter<00:00:56.629> here<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> snake

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
might encounter here we have a snake

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a better variety here now one thing

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
a better variety here now one thing
that's<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:04.830> unique<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.580> tribe<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:07.140> RTS

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that's very unique about tribe as an RTS

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's not like constant action you're not

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
it's not like constant action you're not
making<00:01:26.939> hundreds<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> units<00:01:27.630> you're<00:01:28.590> just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you can think of it as uniting all the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760 
you can think of it as uniting all the
tribes<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.939> continent<00:01:36.450> after<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
tribes on your continent after this you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.510 
tribes on your continent after this you
will<00:01:37.799> progress<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.380> uniting<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.009> all

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
will progress on to uniting all this all

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
will progress on to uniting all this all
the<00:01:41.909> dominant<00:01:42.420> civilizations<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> planet

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the dominant civilizations on the planet

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310 
the dominant civilizations on the planet
and<00:01:44.670> that'll<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> civilization<00:01:45.869> phase<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and that'll be civilization phase and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.690 
and that'll be civilization phase and
then<00:01:46.500> from<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.950> develop<00:01:47.430> UFO

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
then from there you develop UFO

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
then from there you develop UFO
technology<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.930> space<00:01:49.140> game

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
technology and you go on to space game

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.940 
technology and you go on to space game
now<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.880> tribe<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.530> let<00:01:52.530> me<00:01:52.619> select<00:01:52.770> all

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
now here in tribe game let me select all

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
now here in tribe game let me select all
my<00:01:53.070> guys<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.970> idea<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> trial<00:01:54.509> game<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
my guys here the idea of trial game is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.490 
my guys here the idea of trial game is
that<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.470> customization<00:01:56.100> moves<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that your customization moves on to

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.289 
that your customization moves on to
outfitting<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:58.530> tribal<00:01:59.189> area<00:01:59.490> we<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
outfitting your tribal area we have a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.590 
outfitting your tribal area we have a
bunch<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> tools<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> player<00:02:03.240> will
