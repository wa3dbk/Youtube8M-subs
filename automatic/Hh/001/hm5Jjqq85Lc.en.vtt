00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the first thing we talk about is how we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.889 
the first thing we talk about is how we
can<00:00:53.160> throw<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.550> fills<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.719> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
can throw in fills in there so as we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
can throw in fills in there so as we
know<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> loses<00:00:55.559> 12<00:00:55.829> bars<00:00:56.100> long<00:00:56.370> let's<00:00:57.300> say

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
know it loses 12 bars long let's say

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.490

we're<00:00:57.480> gonna<00:00:57.600> look<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> upon<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> piece<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
we're gonna look at it upon a piece of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
we're gonna look at it upon a piece of
paper<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:58.980> three<00:00:59.250> lines<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.000> four<00:01:00.300> bars
