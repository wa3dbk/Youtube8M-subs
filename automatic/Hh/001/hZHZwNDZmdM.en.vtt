00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.039 
this track it's been tricky conditions
so<00:04:16.680> far<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> rain<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.600> don't

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
so far with the rain and and I don't

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.150 
so far with the rain and and I don't
know<00:04:19.109> there<00:04:19.260> are<00:04:19.350> some<00:04:19.500> patches<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
know there are some patches in the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.070 
know there are some patches in the
corners<00:04:20.549> which<00:04:20.700> changes<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.269> balance<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
corners which changes the balance of the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.290 
corners which changes the balance of the
car<00:04:22.260> from<00:04:22.410> corner<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.740> corner<00:04:22.800> but<00:04:23.250> those<00:04:24.120> are

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
car from corner to corner but those are

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.680 
car from corner to corner but those are
those<00:04:24.390> red<00:04:24.660> fire<00:04:24.870> stones<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:26.220> Cuba<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
those red fire stones in in Cuba the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.660 
those red fire stones in in Cuba the
final<00:04:27.960> qualifying<00:04:28.350> there<00:04:28.590> were<00:04:28.710> awesome<00:04:29.580> a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
final qualifying there were awesome a

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.080 
final qualifying there were awesome a
lot<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.940> grip<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.420> as<00:04:31.080> usual<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:32.340> lot<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.820> fun<00:04:32.970> to

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
lot of grip and as usual a lot of fun to

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.690 
lot of grip and as usual a lot of fun to
drive<00:04:33.380> yeah<00:04:34.380> we've<00:04:34.620> been<00:04:34.650> here<00:04:35.010> before<00:04:35.040> so

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
drive yeah we've been here before so

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700 
drive yeah we've been here before so
hopefully<00:04:36.390> it's<00:04:36.780> just<00:04:36.930> another<00:04:37.110> repeat<00:04:37.530> of

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
hopefully it's just another repeat of

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.680 
hopefully it's just another repeat of
what<00:04:37.920> Kim's<00:04:38.190> Glenn<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:39.210> may<00:04:39.360> be<00:04:39.420> pretty

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
what Kim's Glenn and that may be pretty

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.710 
what Kim's Glenn and that may be pretty
happy<00:04:39.870> it's<00:04:40.290> just<00:04:40.880> going<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.150> either<00:04:42.450> get<00:04:42.660> a

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
happy it's just going to either get a

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.020 
happy it's just going to either get a
good<00:04:42.930> start<00:04:43.169> or<00:04:43.500> get<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.070> good<00:04:44.280> run<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.700> two

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
good start or get a good run out of two

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.370 
good start or get a good run out of two
and<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.270> think<00:04:45.480> that's<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> key<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.020> getting

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
and I think that's the key is getting

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.010 
and I think that's the key is getting
one<00:04:46.620> able<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:47.040> use<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.030> close<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.330> pass<00:04:48.540> and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
one able to use the close to pass and

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.630 
one able to use the close to pass and
hopefully<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:49.919> can<00:04:50.070> make<00:04:50.130> something<00:04:50.490> happen

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
hopefully you can make something happen

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.560 
hopefully you can make something happen
but<00:04:51.440> yeah<00:04:52.440> if<00:04:52.710> not<00:04:53.010> we'll<00:04:53.669> we'll<00:04:53.910> into<00:04:54.540> a
