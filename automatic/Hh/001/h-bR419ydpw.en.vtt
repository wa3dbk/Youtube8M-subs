00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:48.619
 We start scoring beat eggs 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.170
 about two minutes we get this 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.490
 mixture 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.590
 we get such a mixture after shooting down 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.000
 there is after this she needs 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.330

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.099
 and 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.730
 whip the resulting mixture add 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.730

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.200
 portionwise, first add half 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.470
 glass and whip to get 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.470
 homogeneous mass 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:20.069
 then add the second part 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:20.069

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:14.390
 add the mixture 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:18.350
 preheated and 2 dining rooms 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.000
 spoons of margarine happens to be margarine just 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.240
 There is a margarine with the addition of creamy 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.280
 oil I am currently using margarine 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:40.540
 adding butter after which 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.540
 mix the resulting contents 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.900
 this 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 and 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.000
 So we take the usual glass add 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.370
 there a spoon of soda and pour all 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.199
 vinegar then add our dough 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.260
 and mix about three 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.710
 after the oven has warmed up 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.960
 180-200 degrees we take the usual forms 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.260
 for cupcakes and fill them this where is she 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.199
 where some two-thirds of the dough that's it 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.770
 dough for fillers I'm going 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.050
 use such sauces for 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:49.479
 ice cream is caramel 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.690
 and raspberry fill the form at 2 3 after 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.300
 why pour a drop 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.610
 filler and put in the oven before 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.180
 pour the dough into the forms you need to take 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:08.610
 sunflower oil and pour a little 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.610
 form after which take the usual gauze and 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:18.729
 wipe all forms like this 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.389
 so that the dough does not stick and does not burn 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:27.130
 this is all sorts of kinsey processed on this 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:30.510
 the moment we take the dough and pour each 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.510
 shape of the face by two-thirds 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:46.340
 in this way after which the form 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:48.529
 add literally a bit of a supplement so 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.840
 we do with all 8 forms and 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.870
 we put the legs so the color of the form behind the floor and 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.139
 so all forms are filled with dough and ready 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.840
 to dip the oven put them in the oven 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.599
 about 15 minutes task itself passed about 5 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.080
 minutes after you have downloaded the chum in 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:09.949
 Look at the oven 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.009
 have risen all this most likely because 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:17.449
 the fact that he put out soda vinegar what 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:21.499
 passed about another 10 minutes and how are you 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:23.659
