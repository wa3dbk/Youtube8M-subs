always thought of this kit as being a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400 
always thought of this kit as being a
bit<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> smaller<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:24.000> I've<00:00:24.960> never<00:00:25.109> had

decals we'll take a look at those in a
minute<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:05.159> well<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> let<00:01:07.350> me<00:01:07.439> unpack<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:08.189> of

minute as well so let me unpack some of
these<00:01:08.400> parts<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.939> we'll<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.450> at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
these parts and we'll take a look at

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.920 
these parts and we'll take a look at
what's<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.760> instruction<00:01:12.420> sheet<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
what's going on the instruction sheet is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.810 
what's going on the instruction sheet is
really<00:01:13.860> big<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.220> nice<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:15.210> laid<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.509> very

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
really big and nice well laid out very

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
really big and nice well laid out very
easy<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.090> read<00:01:18.299> overall<00:01:18.869> everything's<00:01:19.710> well

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
easy to read overall everything's well

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.570 
easy to read overall everything's well
labeled<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:22.590> thing<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> threw<00:01:23.520> me

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
labeled one thing the kind of threw me

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
labeled one thing the kind of threw me
for<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.090> while<00:01:24.390> was<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.259> metal<00:01:25.650> legs

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
for a little while was the metal legs

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
for a little while was the metal legs
here<00:01:27.500> because<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.799> shapes<00:01:29.070> themselves<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
here because the shapes themselves of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.640 
here because the shapes themselves of
the<00:01:30.060> legs<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.900> little<00:01:31.229> different

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the legs are just a little different

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
the legs are just a little different
than<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:33.110> diagrammed<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.970> those<00:01:36.540> pieces

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
than is diagrammed here but those pieces

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.240 
than is diagrammed here but those pieces
are<00:01:37.170> keyed<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> works<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.579> pretty<00:01:38.820> well

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
are keyed so it works out pretty well

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
are keyed so it works out pretty well
overall<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.640> instructions<00:01:42.270> were<00:01:42.360> pretty

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
overall the instructions were pretty

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.210 
overall the instructions were pretty
straight<00:01:43.500> forward<00:01:45.290> there's<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.920> too

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
straight forward there's not really too

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.179 
straight forward there's not really too
many<00:01:47.399> steps<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.040> don't<00:01:50.040> know

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
many steps to this at all I don't know

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
many steps to this at all I don't know
what<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> would<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.790> been<00:01:51.060> expecting<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what I would have been expecting had I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920 
what I would have been expecting had I
bought<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> kit<00:01:52.890> previously<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:54.659> was<00:01:54.689> never

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
bought the kit previously it was never

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.959 
bought the kit previously it was never
really<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> fan<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.979> design<00:01:56.369> when<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> first

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
really a fan of the design when it first

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.999 
really a fan of the design when it first
came<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.719> all<00:01:57.960> those<00:01:58.110> years<00:01:58.170> ago<00:01:58.560> but

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
came out back all those years ago but

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.950 
came out back all those years ago but
seeing<00:01:59.399> this

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
seeing this

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.649 
seeing this
it<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.200> what<00:02:00.409> round<00:02:00.680> two<00:02:00.950> did<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.520> with<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
it and what round two did to it with the

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.420 
it and what round two did to it with the
additional<00:02:03.380> legs<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.010> little<00:02:04.280> new

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
additional legs and a little new

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.899 
additional legs and a little new
engineering<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:07.100> really<00:02:07.310> made<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.610> more

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
engineering it really made a more

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.790 
engineering it really made a more
interesting<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.450> having<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.869> 13<00:02:09.289> 50th

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
interesting and having the 13 50th

worthy if you're into doing that sort of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.660 
worthy if you're into doing that sort of
thing<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:43.250> your<00:02:43.400> stuff<00:02:45.310> all<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.340> color

thing with your stuff all the color

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.600 
thing with your stuff all the color
calls<00:02:47.000> are<00:02:47.480> over<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.190> looks<00:02:49.400> like

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
calls are over here and it looks like

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.949 
calls are over here and it looks like
we've<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:49.880> em<00:02:50.300> amount<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.320> them<00:02:51.700> 4<00:02:52.700> 6<00:02:53.060> 8<00:02:53.330> 10<00:02:53.690> 12

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
we've got em amount of them 4 6 8 10 12

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.220 
we've got em amount of them 4 6 8 10 12
13<00:02:54.440> or<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.160> all<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:56.180> them<00:02:56.300> are<00:02:56.480> model<00:02:56.840> master

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
13 or so all of them are model master

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.890 
13 or so all of them are model master
calls<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.519> those<00:02:58.670> will<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> little<00:02:59.750> on

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
calls so those will be on a little on

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.199 
calls so those will be on a little on
the<00:02:59.930> more<00:03:00.230> expensive<00:03:00.620> side<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.069> there<00:03:02.060> could

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
the more expensive side but there could

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.430 
the more expensive side but there could
be<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.360> lot<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.600> them<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.200> hanging

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
be a lot of them that you have hanging

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.110 
be a lot of them that you have hanging
around<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.070> if<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.459> match<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.880> tones

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
around and if you can match the tones

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.449 
around and if you can match the tones
you're<00:03:05.420> all<00:03:05.540> set<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:06.590> course<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.100> paint<00:03:07.370> job

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
you're all set of course this paint job

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.069 
you're all set of course this paint job
is<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:09.280> relatively<00:03:10.280> unique<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:11.600> could<00:03:11.720> really

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
is so relatively unique you could really

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.370 
is so relatively unique you could really
freestyle<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.250> own<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.840> do<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.989> anyway<00:03:15.110> you

like really nice diagrams here and the
very<00:03:20.570> few<00:03:20.900> decals<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.890> looks<00:03:22.130> like<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:23.510> all

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
very few decals it looks like they all

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.440 
very few decals it looks like they all
go<00:03:23.900> right<00:03:24.170> in<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.410> area<00:03:25.000> here's<00:03:26.000> what<00:03:26.209> those

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
go right in this area here's what those

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.650 
go right in this area here's what those
look<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:27.519> just<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.579> couple<00:03:28.610> emblems<00:03:29.329> some

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.199 
lettering and whatever these wedges are
supposed<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.100> be<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.640> don't<00:03:34.850> quite<00:03:35.150> know

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
supposed to be I don't quite know

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.440 
supposed to be I don't quite know
offhand<00:03:36.549> alright<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:37.760> let's<00:03:37.940> take<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.150> look<00:03:38.360> at

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
offhand alright so let's take a look at

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.020 
offhand alright so let's take a look at
the<00:03:38.540> parts<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.560> doing<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:39.920> really<00:03:40.340> quick<00:03:40.760> count

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the parts but doing a really quick count

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.300 
the parts but doing a really quick count
there's<00:03:41.269> about<00:03:41.420> 60<00:03:41.959> or<00:03:42.049> 70<00:03:42.470> pieces<00:03:42.709> here<00:03:43.100> and

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
there's about 60 or 70 pieces here and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.090 
there's about 60 or 70 pieces here and
the<00:03:43.579> skill<00:03:43.850> level<00:03:43.880> on<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.390> box<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:45.320> coup<00:03:45.680> so

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
the skill level on the box is a coup so

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.930 
the skill level on the box is a coup so
it's<00:03:46.280> fairly<00:03:46.549> standard<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.420> regard<00:03:47.810> as

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
it's fairly standard in that regard as

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.229 
it's fairly standard in that regard as
to<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.060> accuracy<00:03:50.570> as<00:03:51.250> with<00:03:52.250> all<00:03:52.489> model<00:03:53.000> kits

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
to the accuracy as with all model kits

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.590 
to the accuracy as with all model kits
from<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.870> day<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.609> redone<00:03:55.609> by<00:03:55.970> round<00:03:56.329> two

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
from the day this is redone by round two

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.050 
from the day this is redone by round two
this<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.900> originally<00:03:57.560> an<00:03:57.680> AMT<00:03:58.190> kit<00:03:58.459> probably

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
this is originally an AMT kit probably

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.550 
this is originally an AMT kit probably
under<00:03:59.329> herbal<00:03:59.720> from<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.709> 90s<00:04:01.160> if<00:04:01.430> not<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.850> 80s

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
under herbal from the 90s if not the 80s

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.430 
under herbal from the 90s if not the 80s
if<00:04:04.560> not<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.040> mid-80s<00:04:05.490> so<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.090> tool<00:04:06.930> could<00:04:07.260> be

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
if not the mid-80s so this tool could be

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.850 
if not the mid-80s so this tool could be
15-20<00:04:08.250> years<00:04:08.370> old<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.930> accuracy<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> model

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
15-20 years old so the accuracy I model

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.550 
15-20 years old so the accuracy I model
kits<00:04:11.070> back<00:04:11.310> then<00:04:11.580> was<00:04:11.820> not<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.420> hot<00:04:13.050> but

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
kits back then was not all that hot but

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.070 
kits back then was not all that hot but
round<00:04:14.490> two<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.030> added<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.510> couple<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.840> things

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
round two just added a couple of things

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.130 
round two just added a couple of things
including<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.770> metal<00:04:17.040> landing<00:04:17.430> gear<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
including the metal landing gear a

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.460 
including the metal landing gear a
landing<00:04:19.140> Bay<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:21.270> think<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.960> can<00:04:22.140> position

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
landing Bay and I think you can position

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.230 
landing Bay and I think you can position
the<00:04:22.860> wings<00:04:23.070> now<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.760> couldn't<00:04:24.030> do<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the wings now and you couldn't do that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.680 
the wings now and you couldn't do that
before<00:04:25.460> but<00:04:26.460> speaking<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:27.000> them<00:04:27.180> let's<00:04:27.420> take<00:04:27.660> a

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
before but speaking of them let's take a

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.110 
before but speaking of them let's take a
look<00:04:27.900> around<00:04:28.050> here<00:04:28.500> all<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.610> molding<00:04:30.000> is

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
look around here all the molding is

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.830 
look around here all the molding is
pretty<00:04:30.360> crisp<00:04:30.920> some<00:04:31.920> degree<00:04:32.400> oh<00:04:32.670> no<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.600> almost

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
pretty crisp some degree oh no it almost

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.090 
pretty crisp some degree oh no it almost
feels<00:04:34.230> not<00:04:34.620> quite<00:04:34.920> puffy<00:04:35.580> but<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.830> know<00:04:37.920> it's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
feels not quite puffy but you know it's

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.510 
feels not quite puffy but you know it's
definitely<00:04:38.700> not<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:40.440> edges<00:04:40.830> are<00:04:40.980> just<00:04:41.220> ever

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
definitely not the edges are just ever

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.910 
definitely not the edges are just ever
so<00:04:42.030> slightly<00:04:42.060> rounded<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.350> given<00:04:43.890> that

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
so slightly rounded I think given that

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.560 
so slightly rounded I think given that
these<00:04:44.160> are<00:04:44.370> supposed<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.760> be<00:04:44.850> armor<00:04:45.270> plates

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
these are supposed to be armor plates

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.860 
these are supposed to be armor plates
going<00:04:45.930> on<00:04:49.670> so<00:04:50.670> it<00:04:50.790> gives<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.210> little<00:04:51.450> bit<00:04:51.750> of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
going on so it gives it a little bit of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.480 
going on so it gives it a little bit of
a<00:04:52.020> puffy<00:04:52.470> feeling<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:53.520> me<00:04:55.250> details<00:04:56.250> are

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
a puffy feeling to it for me details are

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.310 
a puffy feeling to it for me details are
a<00:04:56.520> little<00:04:56.610> soft<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.330> there<00:04:57.600> that's<00:04:57.870> tough<00:04:58.170> to

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
a little soft in there that's tough to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.170 
a little soft in there that's tough to
tell<00:04:58.530> what's<00:04:58.770> going<00:04:58.860> on<00:04:59.220> exactly

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.670 

but<00:05:06.180> overall<00:05:06.480> some<00:05:06.810> nice<00:05:06.990> detail<00:05:07.470> is

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
but overall some nice detail is

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.090 
but overall some nice detail is
relatively<00:05:08.310> speaking<00:05:09.560> one<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> things<00:05:10.919> I

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
relatively speaking one of the things I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.680 
relatively speaking one of the things I
think<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.400> really<00:05:11.669> need<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.880> do<00:05:12.120> on<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.419> kit

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
think you really need to do on this kit

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.020 
think you really need to do on this kit
is<00:05:12.810> replace<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.410> guns<00:05:13.620> because<00:05:14.220> those<00:05:14.850> are

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
is replace the guns because those are

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.350 
is replace the guns because those are
just<00:05:15.210> terrible<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:17.010> be<00:05:17.280> fair<00:05:17.580> no<00:05:18.030> one<00:05:18.180> does

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
just terrible but be fair no one does

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.330 
just terrible but be fair no one does
guns<00:05:18.630> really<00:05:18.900> well<00:05:19.229> simply<00:05:19.710> because<00:05:20.010> tubes

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
guns really well simply because tubes

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.510 
guns really well simply because tubes
are<00:05:20.550> tough<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:20.910> do<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:22.680> in<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:22.919> regard<00:05:23.130> this

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
are tough to do so in that regard this

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.580 
are tough to do so in that regard this
is<00:05:23.729> a<00:05:23.790> kit<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.180> could<00:05:24.630> use<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:24.900> lot<00:05:25.229> of<00:05:25.380> brass

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
is a kit that could use a lot of brass

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.280 
is a kit that could use a lot of brass
and<00:05:25.620> aluminum<00:05:26.370> work<00:05:26.550> but<00:05:27.210> overall<00:05:27.479> detail<00:05:28.080> is

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
and aluminum work but overall detail is

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.200 
and aluminum work but overall detail is
definitely<00:05:28.800> nice<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.310> striking<00:05:29.850> it's<00:05:30.030> well

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
definitely nice and striking it's well

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.900 
definitely nice and striking it's well
done<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.740> expect<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.520> could<00:05:32.669> really

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
done and I expect that you could really

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.590 
done and I expect that you could really
do<00:05:33.210> some<00:05:33.560> nice<00:05:34.560> color<00:05:34.889> work<00:05:35.190> with<00:05:35.430> this<00:05:35.610> given

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
do some nice color work with this given

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900 
do some nice color work with this given
that<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.080> TV<00:05:37.440> series<00:05:37.470> all<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.700> ships

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
that in the TV series all of the ships

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.969 
that in the TV series all of the ships
seem<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.419> have<00:05:39.570> a<00:05:39.600> relatively<00:05:40.200> unique<00:05:40.620> color

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
seem to have a relatively unique color

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.240 
seem to have a relatively unique color
scheme<00:05:42.080> over<00:05:43.080> here<00:05:43.260> on<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.500> legs<00:05:43.710> they<00:05:44.040> come

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
scheme over here on the legs they come

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.570 
scheme over here on the legs they come
in<00:05:44.370> two<00:05:44.520> pieces<00:05:45.229> they're<00:05:46.229> keyed<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.860> join<00:05:47.370> up

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
in two pieces they're keyed to join up

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.930 
in two pieces they're keyed to join up
specifically<00:05:48.270> with<00:05:49.200> one<00:05:49.800> or<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.280> other<00:05:50.310> you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
specifically with one or the other you

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.930 
specifically with one or the other you
can't<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.300> link<00:05:51.720> both<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:52.139> them<00:05:52.290> in<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.940> couple

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
can't just link both of them in a couple

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.700 
can't just link both of them in a couple
plastic<00:05:54.419> pieces<00:05:54.630> here<00:05:54.990> there's<00:05:55.260> definitely<00:05:55.650> a

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
plastic pieces here there's definitely a

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.770 
plastic pieces here there's definitely a
lot<00:05:55.830> of<00:05:56.010> good<00:05:56.039> detail<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:57.000> torpedo<00:05:57.479> tube

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
lot of good detail on the torpedo tube

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.189 
lot of good detail on the torpedo tube
Bay<00:05:58.289> there<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.979> right<00:05:59.539> this<00:06:00.539> engine<00:06:00.840> piece

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
Bay there on the right this engine piece

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.270 
Bay there on the right this engine piece
has<00:06:01.470> some<00:06:02.039> nice<00:06:02.190> detailing<00:06:02.760> as<00:06:03.030> well<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:05.190> know

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
has some nice detailing as well you know

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.980 
has some nice detailing as well you know
there's<00:06:05.400> just<00:06:05.669> no<00:06:05.820> way<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.030> really<00:06:06.300> put<00:06:06.660> many

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
there's just no way to really put many

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.250 
there's just no way to really put many
of<00:06:07.169> these<00:06:07.260> pieces<00:06:07.560> together<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:09.260> there's

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
of these pieces together and there's

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.840 
of these pieces together and there's
just<00:06:10.440> too<00:06:10.650> many<00:06:10.770> spread<00:06:11.280> across<00:06:11.460> too<00:06:11.820> many

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
just too many spread across too many

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.909 
just too many spread across too many
sprue<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.600> the<00:06:12.810> shapes<00:06:13.050> are<00:06:13.260> too<00:06:13.410> strange<00:06:13.800> to

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
sprue and the shapes are too strange to

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.580 
sprue and the shapes are too strange to
really<00:06:14.280> tape<00:06:14.490> up<00:06:14.760> but<00:06:15.750> this<00:06:15.960> is<00:06:16.110> definitely<00:06:16.320> a

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
really tape up but this is definitely a

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.670 
really tape up but this is definitely a
really<00:06:16.770> good<00:06:17.039> size<00:06:17.280> here<00:06:18.080> just<00:06:19.080> over<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.380> foot

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
really good size here just over a foot

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.020 
really good size here just over a foot
across<00:06:19.889> at<00:06:20.250> least<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.669> that<00:06:20.789> probably

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
across at least and that probably

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.610 
across at least and that probably
changes<00:06:21.539> depending<00:06:21.870> on<00:06:21.990> what<00:06:22.169> setting<00:06:22.500> the
