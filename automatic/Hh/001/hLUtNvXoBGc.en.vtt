hotter in order to check the clearance

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.050 
hotter in order to check the clearance
you<00:00:20.820> select<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.550> proper<00:00:23.550> clearance<00:00:23.880> from<00:00:23.970> your

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you select a proper clearance from your

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550 
you select a proper clearance from your
feeler<00:00:24.390> gauge<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.960> should<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.350> between

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
feeler gauge and that should be between

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.880 
feeler gauge and that should be between
51<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.779> 57<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> believe<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.439> intakes

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

51 and 57 I believe for the intakes
height<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> slide<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> between<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
height and you slide that between the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
rocker arm and the camshaft and it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.020 
rocker arm and the camshaft and it
should<00:00:34.110> fit<00:00:34.320> snugly<00:00:34.890> without<00:00:35.340> any<00:00:35.579> excess

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
should fit snugly without any excess

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
should fit snugly without any excess
FreePlay<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> we're<00:00:43.559> gonna<00:00:43.649> slide<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
FreePlay so we're gonna slide it in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.410 
FreePlay so we're gonna slide it in
there<00:00:44.430> between<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.879> rocker<00:00:45.090> arm<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.390> a

there between the rocker arm and a
camshaft<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.670> break<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
camshaft and then we're gonna break the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750 
camshaft and then we're gonna break the
12<00:00:48.629> millimeter<00:00:48.989> nut<00:00:49.260> free<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.399> valve<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
12 millimeter nut free and the valve is

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930 
12 millimeter nut free and the valve is
adjusted<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> slot<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.530> center<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
adjusted with a slot in the center and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
adjusted with a slot in the center and
while<00:00:54.480> holding<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> retaining<00:00:55.530> nut<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
while holding that retaining nut in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.060 
while holding that retaining nut in
place<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.820> turn<00:00:57.660> clockwise<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.559> tighten<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
place you turn clockwise to tighten the

place you turn clockwise to tighten the
valve<00:00:59.250> clearance<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.969> counterclockwise<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
valve clearance or counterclockwise to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.970 
valve clearance or counterclockwise to
loosen<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
loosen it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.030 
loosen it
we'll<00:01:02.460> adjust<00:01:03.359> each<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.589> down<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> our

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
we'll adjust each one go down to our

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.250 
we'll adjust each one go down to our
snug<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> feeler<00:01:06.119> gauge<00:01:06.420> fits

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
snug and then the feeler gauge fits

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.010 
snug and then the feeler gauge fits
snugly<00:01:08.030> once<00:01:09.030> we've<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.330> adjusted<00:01:09.900> correctly

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
snugly once we've got adjusted correctly

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
snugly once we've got adjusted correctly
then<00:01:10.770> we'll<00:01:10.920> tie<00:01:11.100> tighten<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> locking

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
then we'll tie tighten down that locking

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.770 
then we'll tie tighten down that locking
nut<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:14.010> recheck<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> again<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.630> we'll

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
nut and then recheck it again and we'll

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
nut and then recheck it again and we'll
do<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.110> each<00:01:16.500> valve<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.220> break<00:01:20.549> them

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
do that on each valve you can break them

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
do that on each valve you can break them
free<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> 12<00:01:21.420> millimeter<00:01:21.869> socket<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
free with a 12 millimeter socket it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
free with a 12 millimeter socket it
gives<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.790> better<00:01:24.000> torque<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
gives you a little bit better torque and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.070 
gives you a little bit better torque and
with<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> extension<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:27.080> better

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
with the extension you got better

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
with the extension you got better
accessibility<00:01:28.549> but<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.790> comes<00:01:30.000> time<00:01:30.210> for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
accessibility but when it comes time for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.920 
accessibility but when it comes time for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
tightening 12 millimeter boxing wrench

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
tightening 12 millimeter boxing wrench
works<00:01:34.229> best<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> have

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
works best because you have to have

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.179 
works best because you have to have
clearance<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> adjustment<00:01:37.650> slot<00:01:38.009> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
clearance to get the adjustment slot in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.960 
clearance to get the adjustment slot in
the<00:01:38.280> top<00:01:38.490> while<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.820> holding<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> nut<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the top while you're holding the nut you

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.420 
the top while you're holding the nut you
could<00:01:41.970> use<00:01:42.180> an<00:01:42.360> opening<00:01:42.780> box<00:01:43.350> wrench<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
could use an opening box wrench but it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.810 
could use an opening box wrench but it
has<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> tendency<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.149> slide<00:01:45.450> off<00:01:46.610> easier<00:01:47.610> than

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
has a tendency to slide off easier than

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.620 
has a tendency to slide off easier than
a<00:01:47.880> box<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:52.610> see<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> difficult<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> get

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
a box and see it's difficult here to get

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.910 
a box and see it's difficult here to get
the<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:54.869> angle<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.100> socket

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the right angle with the socket

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
the right angle with the socket
accessibility<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.430> different

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
accessibility can be a little different

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
accessibility can be a little different
difficult<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.619> once<00:02:01.799> I've<00:02:01.950> broken<00:02:02.189> retaining

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
difficult so once I've broken retaining

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
difficult so once I've broken retaining
that<00:02:02.790> free<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.079> gonna<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.469> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that free then I'm gonna just this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
that free then I'm gonna just this

that after you've got it snug then you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
that after you've got it snug then you
