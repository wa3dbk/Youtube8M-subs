I<00:01:25.390> think<00:01:25.660> that<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.900> really<00:01:26.740> really<00:01:27.130> really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
I think that is really really really

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.900

cool

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
cool

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.770 
cool
and<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.720> really<00:01:28.960> like<00:01:29.110> how<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.970> curves<00:01:31.510> are

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
done they're actually sort of molded I

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.090 
done they're actually sort of molded I
think<00:01:35.080> they're<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:35.320> printed<00:01:35.710> onto<00:01:35.890> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
think they're just printed onto the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.820 
think they're just printed onto the
glazing<00:01:36.940> pretty<00:01:37.450> much<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:38.440> there<00:01:38.590> are<00:01:38.680> very

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
of the best cars I've ever seen actually

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.370 
of the best cars I've ever seen actually
and<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.640> addition<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.210> what<00:01:52.659> Hornby's<00:01:53.050> doing

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and in addition to what Hornby's doing

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.330 
and in addition to what Hornby's doing
with<00:01:53.560> their<00:01:54.070> new<00:01:55.050> grizzly<00:01:56.050> teak<00:01:56.320> stock<00:01:56.680> that

and<00:04:02.099> I'm<00:04:02.459> not<00:04:02.609> sure<00:04:02.760> what<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.269> think

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
and I'm not sure what that is I think

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.059 
and I'm not sure what that is I think
that<00:04:03.599> might<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.750> some<00:04:03.959> sort<00:04:04.079> of<00:04:04.169> water<00:04:04.409> pump<00:04:04.919> or

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
that might be some sort of water pump or

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.240 
that might be some sort of water pump or
something<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.919> see<00:04:08.069> where<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
something but you can see where the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.969 
something but you can see where the
contacts<00:04:08.849> are<00:04:09.000> for<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.389> lights<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.859> it

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
contacts are for the lights and it

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:16.099 
contacts are for the lights and it
really<00:04:11.159> does<00:04:11.370> look<00:04:11.639> like<00:04:11.699> a<00:04:13.129> extremely<00:04:15.109> well

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
really does look like a extremely well

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.099
