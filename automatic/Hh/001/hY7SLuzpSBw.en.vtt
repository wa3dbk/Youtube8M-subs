it<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.700> established<00:03:02.030> earlier<00:03:02.689> in<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> fight

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
it was established earlier in the fight

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.979 
it was established earlier in the fight
that<00:03:03.230> Frieza<00:03:03.739> was<00:03:04.129> unable<00:03:04.879> to<00:03:05.090> sense<00:03:05.510> energy

that Frieza was unable to sense energy

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.009 
that Frieza was unable to sense energy
and<00:03:06.260> Goku<00:03:07.189> could<00:03:07.430> therefore<00:03:08.060> Goku<00:03:08.810> was

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
and Goku could therefore Goku was

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.660 
and Goku could therefore Goku was
telling<00:03:09.439> the<00:03:09.560> truth<00:03:09.590> even<00:03:10.069> though<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.519> was

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
telling the truth even though it was

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.160 
telling the truth even though it was
difficult<00:03:10.819> for<00:03:11.180> Frieza<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.689> come<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.959> terms

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
difficult for Frieza to come to terms

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.280 
difficult for Frieza to come to terms
with<00:03:12.319> it<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.560> believe<00:03:13.280> him<00:03:13.629> Goku's<00:03:14.629> comments

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
with it and believe him Goku's comments

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.619 
with it and believe him Goku's comments
much<00:03:15.829> like<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.220> legend<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.030> super<00:03:17.389> Sayan

much like the legend of the super Sayan

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.500 
much like the legend of the super Sayan
became<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.319> self-fulfilling<00:03:18.950> prophecy<00:03:19.510> while

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
became a self-fulfilling prophecy while

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.720 
became a self-fulfilling prophecy while
there<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:20.840> no<00:03:21.049> doubt<00:03:21.079> in<00:03:21.470> my<00:03:21.650> mind<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.129> Goku

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
there is no doubt in my mind that Goku

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.369 
there is no doubt in my mind that Goku
would<00:03:22.909> have<00:03:23.030> eventually<00:03:23.299> finished<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.139> fight

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
would have eventually finished the fight

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.140 
would have eventually finished the fight
had<00:03:24.590> he<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:24.829> established<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.579> strategy<00:03:25.819> of

had he not established a strategy of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.449 
had he not established a strategy of
going<00:03:26.329> for<00:03:26.569> Frieza<00:03:26.810> stomach<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:27.530> still<00:03:28.220> made

going for Frieza stomach it still made

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.849 
going for Frieza stomach it still made
the<00:03:28.609> fight<00:03:28.879> much<00:03:29.180> quicker<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.870> much<00:03:30.019> simpler

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
the fight much quicker and much simpler

had<00:03:50.449> the<00:03:50.659> feeling<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.349> time<00:03:52.340> running<00:03:52.669> out<00:03:52.940> if

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
had the feeling of time running out if

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.899 
had the feeling of time running out if
you<00:03:53.389> ask<00:03:53.569> me<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.159> Goku<00:03:55.159> had<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.519> do<00:03:55.639> what<00:03:55.790> it

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
you ask me and Goku had to do what it

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.629 
you ask me and Goku had to do what it
took<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.120> win<00:03:56.449> and<00:03:56.750> therefore<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:58.099> strategy

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
took to win and therefore the strategy

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.879 
took to win and therefore the strategy
he<00:03:58.819> used<00:03:59.090> was<00:03:59.569> indeed<00:03:59.930> successful<00:04:00.169> and<00:04:00.799> it

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
he used was indeed successful and it

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.119 
he used was indeed successful and it
broke<00:04:01.099> Frieza<00:04:01.489> hence<00:04:02.389> why<00:04:03.109> Frieza<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:03.889> so

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
broke Frieza hence why Frieza is so

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.240 
broke Frieza hence why Frieza is so
angry<00:04:04.400> at<00:04:04.729> Goku<00:04:05.269> even<00:04:06.049> though<00:04:06.229> trunks<00:04:06.889> was<00:04:07.099> the

had equally as much hatred if not more

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.029 
had equally as much hatred if not more
for<00:04:13.040> Goku<00:04:13.489> because<00:04:14.359> Goku<00:04:14.959> embarrassed<00:04:15.799> him

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
for Goku because Goku embarrassed him

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.849

Frieza<00:04:16.609> as<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> villain<00:04:17.599> is<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:18.199> much<00:04:18.620> more

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
Frieza as a villain is a much more

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.219 
Frieza as a villain is a much more
