four-cylinder and you'll still get a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
four-cylinder and you'll still get a
five-speed<00:01:38.009> automatic<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> o7<00:01:39.360> model<00:01:39.659> or

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
like the Smart car because that's just

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.980

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
like in regards to the 2012 one I would

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.140 
like in regards to the 2012 one I would
actually<00:03:23.410> offer<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.340> because<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.030> a

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
actually offer that one because it is a

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.480 
actually offer that one because it is a
little<00:03:25.360> bit<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.690> smaller<00:03:26.050> exterior<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.070> it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
little bit of a smaller exterior and it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.250 
little bit of a smaller exterior and it
kind<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.730> makes<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.060> car<00:03:28.270> look<00:03:28.420> less<00:03:28.660> heavy<00:03:28.959> so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
kind of makes the car look less heavy so

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.160 
kind of makes the car look less heavy so
if<00:03:29.350> you're<00:03:29.470> looking<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.890> more<00:03:30.010> stylish

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
that I'm kind of confused on that part

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.790 
that I'm kind of confused on that part
but<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:52.360> know<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.660> doesn't<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.320> dashboard

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
but you know it doesn't the dashboard

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.229 
but you know it doesn't the dashboard
itself<00:03:54.100> was<00:03:54.280> pretty<00:03:54.459> modern<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.090> not

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
itself was pretty modern it's not

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.740 
itself was pretty modern it's not
outdated<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:56.170> know<00:03:56.739> yeah<00:03:57.700> it's<00:03:58.060> got<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.269> tach

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
outdated you know yeah it's got the tach

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.080 
outdated you know yeah it's got the tach
in<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.260> other<00:03:59.650> stuff<00:03:59.980> all<00:04:00.340> located<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:00.940> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
in the other stuff all located in the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.930 
in the other stuff all located in the
same<00:04:01.300> exact<00:04:01.600> spot<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.200> usually<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:03.640> I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
same exact spot as it usually is but I

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.120 
same exact spot as it usually is but I
like<00:04:04.360> this<00:04:04.540> -<00:04:04.810> Matt<00:04:05.080> better<00:04:05.440> than<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.739> new<00:04:05.890> one

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
like this - Matt better than the new one

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.220 
like this - Matt better than the new one
just<00:04:06.910> because<00:04:07.239> I'm<00:04:07.510> more<00:04:07.959> of<00:04:08.110> like<00:04:08.140> a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
just because I'm more of like a

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.870 
just because I'm more of like a
simplistic<00:04:08.739> kind<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.130> person<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.550> don't<00:04:09.610> like

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
simplistic kind of person I don't like

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.479 
simplistic kind of person I don't like
complicated<00:04:10.570> things<00:04:10.870> which<00:04:11.739> reminds<00:04:12.070> me<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
complicated things which reminds me you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.710 
complicated things which reminds me you
know<00:04:12.519> I'm<00:04:12.670> not<00:04:12.790> really<00:04:12.880> into<00:04:13.000> relationships

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
know I'm not really into relationships

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.150 
know I'm not really into relationships
that's<00:04:13.900> probably<00:04:14.260> why<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:14.890> don't<00:04:15.040> like

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
that's probably why because I don't like

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.310 
that's probably why because I don't like
complicated<00:04:15.700> things<00:04:16.060> but<00:04:16.810> um

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
complicated things but um

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.240 
complicated things but um

Corolla<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.450> not<00:04:47.930> sure<00:04:48.170> I'll<00:04:48.290> have<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.470> double

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
Corolla I'm not sure I'll have to double

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.910 
Corolla I'm not sure I'll have to double
check<00:04:49.010> on<00:04:49.160> that<00:04:49.310> with<00:04:50.320> 250,000<00:04:51.320> miles<00:04:51.500> and

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
check on that with 250,000 miles and

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.890 
check on that with 250,000 miles and
literally<00:04:52.850> only<00:04:53.060> one<00:04:53.360> problem<00:04:53.600> was<00:04:53.870> a

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
literally only one problem was a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900 
literally only one problem was a
carburetor<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.740> they<00:04:55.280> couldn't<00:04:55.580> find<00:04:55.730> they

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
carburetor and they couldn't find they

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.640 
carburetor and they couldn't find they
were<00:04:56.030> part<00:04:56.450> pressure<00:04:56.750> becoming<00:04:57.170> harder<00:04:57.560> to

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
were part pressure becoming harder to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.560 
were part pressure becoming harder to
find<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.640> know<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.970> was<00:04:59.090> just<00:04:59.150> time<00:04:59.240> for<00:04:59.420> a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
find so you know it was just time for a

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.000 
find so you know it was just time for a
new<00:04:59.690> car<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.200> believe<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.530> Corolla<00:05:00.860> is

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
new car and I believe the Corolla is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.170 
new car and I believe the Corolla is
still<00:05:01.220> running<00:05:01.460> today<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.760> person<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.150> I

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
still running today the person that I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.670 
still running today the person that I
gave<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.510> I<00:05:02.630> believe<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:02.990> still<00:05:03.080> driving<00:05:03.380> it

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
gave it to I believe is still driving it

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.000 
gave it to I believe is still driving it
so<00:05:04.520> uh<00:05:04.870> yeah<00:05:05.900> Toyota's<00:05:06.410> pretty<00:05:06.650> decent

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
so uh yeah Toyota's pretty decent

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.580 
so uh yeah Toyota's pretty decent
overall<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.990> haven't<00:05:08.990> had<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> problem<00:05:09.320> with<00:05:09.500> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
overall I haven't had a problem with the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.170 
overall I haven't had a problem with the
sticking<00:05:09.890> accelerator<00:05:10.370> pedal<00:05:10.700> on<00:05:10.790> this<00:05:10.940> car

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
sticking accelerator pedal on this car

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.570 
sticking accelerator pedal on this car
and<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.950> know<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.190> could<00:05:13.280> be<00:05:13.400> very

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
and you know that could be very

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.920 
and you know that could be very
problematic<00:05:13.790> since<00:05:14.330> I'm<00:05:14.450> driving<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.900> right

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
problematic since I'm driving it right

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.640 
problematic since I'm driving it right
now

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
now

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.960 
now
so<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.970> general<00:05:17.420> pretty<00:05:17.660> decent<00:05:18.080> car<00:05:18.970> actually

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
so in general pretty decent car actually

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.580 
so in general pretty decent car actually
and<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.300> was<00:05:20.420> kind<00:05:20.630> of<00:05:20.660> mad<00:05:20.840> at<00:05:20.870> my<00:05:21.020> grandpa<00:05:21.050> for

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
and I was kind of mad at my grandpa for

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.530 
and I was kind of mad at my grandpa for
buying<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:21.980> car<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.850> reason<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.150> say<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:23.360> is

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
buying this car the reason I say that is

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.820 
buying this car the reason I say that is
because<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.870> really<00:05:24.260> wanted<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.560> learn<00:05:24.650> how<00:05:24.800> to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
because I really wanted to learn how to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.100 
because I really wanted to learn how to
drive<00:05:25.040> a<00:05:25.100> stick<00:05:25.430> shift<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.540> couldn't<00:05:26.840> drive

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
drive a stick shift and I couldn't drive

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.840 
drive a stick shift and I couldn't drive
it<00:05:27.140> because<00:05:27.380> my<00:05:27.740> grandfather<00:05:28.040> just<00:05:28.490> got<00:05:28.700> rid

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
it because my grandfather just got rid

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.250 
it because my grandfather just got rid
of<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.000> Corolla<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.540> I<00:05:29.570> was<00:05:29.720> gonna<00:05:29.840> learn<00:05:30.050> on

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
of the Corolla that I was gonna learn on

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.700 
of the Corolla that I was gonna learn on
so<00:05:30.830> I<00:05:30.860> was<00:05:31.190> legitimately<00:05:31.540> pissed<00:05:32.540> like<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.560> was

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
so I was legitimately pissed like I was

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.490 
so I was legitimately pissed like I was
so<00:05:33.920> mad<00:05:34.160> I<00:05:34.220> was<00:05:34.550> like<00:05:34.700> damn<00:05:35.030> it<00:05:35.180> why<00:05:35.840> did<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.140> do

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
so mad I was like damn it why did you do

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.030

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
that

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.000 
that
but<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.730> understood<00:05:38.120> the<00:05:38.240> I<00:05:38.450> understood<00:05:38.780> the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
but I understood the I understood the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.890 
but I understood the I understood the
the<00:05:40.010> premises<00:05:40.460> behind<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.210> now<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:41.780> have

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
the premises behind it and now I have

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.660 
the premises behind it and now I have
the<00:05:42.170> Honda<00:05:42.590> since<00:05:42.830> as<00:05:43.220> they<00:05:43.370> basically

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
the Honda since as they basically

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.820 
the Honda since as they basically
confuse<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.420> car<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:45.020> really<00:05:45.650> they<00:05:45.740> don't

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
confuse this car and really they don't

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.110 
confuse this car and really they don't
need<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.130> other<00:05:46.280> one<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:46.670> the<00:05:46.760> Honda<00:05:47.060> is

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
need the other one so the Honda is

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.710 
need the other one so the Honda is
basically<00:05:47.450> mine<00:05:49.180> I'm<00:05:50.180> running<00:05:50.480> out<00:05:50.570> of<00:05:50.600> a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
basically mine I'm running out of a

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.700 
basically mine I'm running out of a
little<00:05:50.870> bit<00:05:51.020> I'm<00:05:51.080> running<00:05:51.290> out<00:05:51.380> of<00:05:51.410> time<00:05:51.650> so

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
little bit I'm running out of time so

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.430 
little bit I'm running out of time so
I'm<00:05:52.250> gonna<00:05:52.370> have<00:05:52.580> to<00:05:52.670> cut<00:05:52.880> this<00:05:53.000> video<00:05:53.300> off<00:05:53.540> but

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
I will it's starting most likely in

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.120 
I will it's starting most likely in
December<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.290> looks<00:05:57.440> like<00:05:57.680> I'll<00:05:57.890> be<00:05:58.010> getting

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130
