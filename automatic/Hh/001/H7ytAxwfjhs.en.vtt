that<00:06:25.039> my<00:06:26.039> only<00:06:26.219> real<00:06:26.550> complaint<00:06:26.729> with<00:06:27.090> the

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
that my only real complaint with the

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.230 
that my only real complaint with the
gameplay<00:06:27.569> is<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.199> bloody<00:06:28.560> camera<00:06:29.240> the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
gameplay is that bloody camera the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.909 
gameplay is that bloody camera the
problem<00:06:30.599> isn't<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.020> it<00:06:31.199> rotates<00:06:31.620> so

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
problem isn't that it rotates so

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.219 
problem isn't that it rotates so
incredibly<00:06:32.610> fast<00:06:32.969> it<00:06:33.539> that<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:33.930> blurs<00:06:34.199> the

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
incredibly fast it that it blurs the

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.529 
incredibly fast it that it blurs the
background<00:06:34.889> which<00:06:35.219> is<00:06:35.430> great<00:06:35.909> for<00:06:36.240> giving<00:06:36.360> you

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
background which is great for giving you

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:36.980 
background which is great for giving you
a<00:06:36.569> headache
