00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
exactly how far you've gone so you know

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.660 
exactly how far you've gone so you know
that<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.530> complete<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.070> also<00:00:44.219> made<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that it's complete we also made this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
that it's complete we also made this
opening<00:00:45.120> larger<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> widest<00:00:46.289> fill

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
opening larger so it's the widest fill

opening larger so it's the widest fill
port<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> market<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> any<00:00:47.370> reservoir<00:00:47.879> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
port on the market of any reservoir so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
port on the market of any reservoir so
it's<00:00:48.450> easy<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:48.989> hand<00:00:49.200> inside<00:00:49.530> clean

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it's easy to get your hand inside clean

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's easy to get your hand inside clean
it<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.460> redesigning<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> cap<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:52.140> wanted<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it in redesigning the cap we wanted to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
it in redesigning the cap we wanted to
cut<00:00:52.949> weight<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> streamline<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.940> design<00:00:54.360> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
cut weight and streamline the design so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779 
cut weight and streamline the design so
we've<00:00:54.870> made<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> cap<00:00:55.440> itself<00:00:55.860> 19<00:00:56.430> percent

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
we've made the cap itself 19 percent

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.569 
we've made the cap itself 19 percent
lighter<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.379> 28<00:00:58.379> percent<00:00:58.530> lower<00:00:58.890> profile<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
lighter and 28 percent lower profile so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
lighter and 28 percent lower profile so
it's<00:00:59.699> got<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.090> shorter<00:01:00.120> stack<00:01:00.690> height<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it's got a lot shorter stack height so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's got a lot shorter stack height so
it's<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.320> slide<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> pack

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it's gonna slide in and out of the pack

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's gonna slide in and out of the pack
easier<00:01:02.670> you've<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.539> flip<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.080> dryer

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
easier you've got these flip out dryer

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
easier you've got these flip out dryer
arms<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> are<00:01:05.189> made<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> grill<00:01:05.700> amid<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
arms that are made out of grill amid the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
arms that are made out of grill amid the
dryer<00:01:06.659> arms<00:01:06.990> pop<00:01:07.260> open<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.670> easily

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
dryer arms pop open so you can easily

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
dryer arms pop open so you can easily
invert<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.479> reservoir<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.500> allow<00:01:10.740> air<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
invert your reservoir and allow air to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
invert your reservoir and allow air to
circulate<00:01:11.310> through<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> help<00:01:12.060> dry<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.420> you'll

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
circulate through to help dry it you'll

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
circulate through to help dry it you'll
notice<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> shape<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:13.979> bit

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
notice that the shape is a little bit

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
notice that the shape is a little bit
wider<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> broader<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
wider and broader and that's so when the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.109 
wider and broader and that's so when the
reservoir<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> full<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> water<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.000> gonna

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
reservoir is full of water it's gonna

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.330 
reservoir is full of water it's gonna
have<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> lower<00:01:18.720> profile<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.799> bit<00:01:20.189> better

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
have a lower profile a little bit better

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
have a lower profile a little bit better
fit<00:01:20.670> inside<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> pack<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.020> added<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
fit inside the pack we also added a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
fit inside the pack we also added a
baffle<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> runs<00:01:23.130> down<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> center<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.150> can

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
baffle that runs down the center you can

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
baffle that runs down the center you can
see<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> reduces<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> stack<00:01:25.619> height<00:01:25.890> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
see that it reduces the stack height of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
see that it reduces the stack height of
the<00:01:26.100> reservoir<00:01:26.490> itself<00:01:26.549> by<00:01:27.000> 26%<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:28.229> you're

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the reservoir itself by 26% if you're

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.780 
the reservoir itself by 26% if you're
unfamiliar<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> bite<00:01:29.130> valve<00:01:29.220> true<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
unfamiliar with the bite valve true to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.539 
unfamiliar with the bite valve true to
its<00:01:29.909> name<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.659> bite<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> drink<00:01:31.740> let<00:01:32.340> go

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
its name you just bite it drink let go

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
its name you just bite it drink let go
it'll<00:01:33.060> self<00:01:33.299> seal<00:01:33.570> definitely<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> best

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
