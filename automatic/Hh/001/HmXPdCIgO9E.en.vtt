hearing<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.789> more<00:00:20.880> talk<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.660> in

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
hearing more and more talk about that in

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.830 
hearing more and more talk about that in
recent<00:00:21.990> years<00:00:22.350> well<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.710> think<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.490> true<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.810> I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
recent years well I think it's true or I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.390 
recent years well I think it's true or I
think<00:00:25.080> we've<00:00:25.320> been<00:00:25.500> hearing<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
think we've been hearing more about it

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.220 
think we've been hearing more about it
because<00:00:26.910> we've<00:00:27.090> had<00:00:27.240> some<00:00:27.510> real<00:00:27.689> marquee

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
because we've had some real marquee

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.859 
because we've had some real marquee
games<00:00:28.560> recently<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.789> had<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.330> had<00:00:30.480> Florida

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
games recently you had you had Florida

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.089 
games recently you had you had Florida
State<00:00:31.080> Auburn<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> national

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
State Auburn for the national

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.990 
State Auburn for the national
championship<00:00:32.870> we've<00:00:33.870> had<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> NFL<00:00:34.649> playoffs

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
championship we've had the NFL playoffs

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
championship we've had the NFL playoffs
you<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.270> limited<00:00:36.630> card<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> will

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
you know in a limited card if you will

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.310 
you know in a limited card if you will
we<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> divisional<00:00:39.360> playoffs<00:00:39.420> last<00:00:40.079> week

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we had the divisional playoffs last week

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
we had the divisional playoffs last week
so<00:00:40.649> there's<00:00:40.950> been<00:00:41.160> more<00:00:41.460> focus<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.210> fewer

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so there's been more focus on fewer

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270 
so there's been more focus on fewer
games<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.739> hearing<00:00:44.100> more

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
games and I think you are hearing more
of<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> talk<00:00:44.760> certainly<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.450> recent<00:00:45.809> recent

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230

Auburn<00:00:48.750> game<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> great

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
Auburn game because I think it's a great

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.729 
Auburn game because I think it's a great
example<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:51.239> line<00:00:51.510> basically<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
example where that line basically you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
example where that line basically you
took<00:00:52.920> Auburn<00:00:53.309> plus<00:00:53.579> eight<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> half<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
back and forth staying essentially the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
thing about it I mean because you know

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
thing about it I mean because you know
maybe<00:01:31.829> they're<00:01:32.159> waiting<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> maybe<00:01:33.119> they'd

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
maybe they're waiting and maybe they'd

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
maybe they're waiting and maybe they'd
like<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> other<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
like that and and the other thing is you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
like that and and the other thing is you
know<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.290> eight<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> half<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.520> eight

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
know it was eight and a half or or eight

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
know it was eight and a half or or eight
or<00:01:39.150> whatever<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.869> forever<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> long

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
or whatever it was forever for a long

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.480 
or whatever it was forever for a long
time<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.600> maybe<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:44.040> got<00:01:44.280> all

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
time and so maybe they they got all

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
time and so maybe they they got all
their<00:01:44.909> resources<00:01:45.329> together<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.380> went

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
their resources together and they went

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
their resources together and they went
in<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.159> nailed<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> eight<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> may

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
in and they nailed the eight then it may

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.060 
in and they nailed the eight then it may
be<00:01:48.810> eight<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> half<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.770> kept

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
be eight and a half and they kept

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
be eight and a half and they kept
nailing<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.149> maybe<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.540> backed

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
nailing it and then maybe they backed

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.649 
nailing it and then maybe they backed
off<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.100> ten<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.360> maybe

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
off when it got to ten and then maybe

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
off when it got to ten and then maybe
you<00:01:55.140> had<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> followers<00:01:55.950> come<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.790> maybe

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you had the followers come in that maybe

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.240 
you had the followers come in that maybe
heard<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.600> Billy<00:01:57.930> Walters<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.070> or

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
heard both Billy Walters is on it or

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
heard both Billy Walters is on it or
someone<00:01:59.640> else<00:01:59.790> at<00:02:00.210> 10<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.450> 11<00:02:00.630> or

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
someone else at 10 or 11 or

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.760 
someone else at 10 or 11 or
what-have-you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
what-have-you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.120 
what-have-you
so<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.840> was<00:02:04.110> sharp<00:02:04.409> money<00:02:04.680> at<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so so maybe that was sharp money at the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.119 
so so maybe that was sharp money at the
8th<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.460> 9th<00:02:05.759> or<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.899> not<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> 10<00:02:08.009> or

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
8th or the 9th or but not at the 10 or

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.229 
8th or the 9th or but not at the 10 or
the<00:02:08.160> Allah<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> same<00:02:09.030> thing<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the Allah I think the same thing is

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.639 
the Allah I think the same thing is
happening<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> NFL<00:02:10.319> where<00:02:10.500> what's

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
happening in the NFL where what's

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.350 
happening in the NFL where what's
happening<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> opening<00:02:11.700> number<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
happening is the opening number is is

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
happening is the opening number is is
dictating<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> Sharps

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
dictating the Sharps

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460 
dictating the Sharps
as<00:02:14.640> an<00:02:14.850> example<00:02:15.090> San<00:02:15.420> Diego<00:02:15.750> opens<00:02:16.080> at<00:02:16.230> 10:00

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
as an example San Diego opens at 10:00

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.870 
as an example San Diego opens at 10:00
so<00:02:17.430> San<00:02:17.850> Diego<00:02:18.240> plus<00:02:18.480> 10<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> sharp<00:02:19.260> side

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
so San Diego plus 10 is the sharp side

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.730 
so San Diego plus 10 is the sharp side
against<00:02:20.880> Denver<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> oddsmakers<00:02:22.410> had

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
against Denver but if the oddsmakers had

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.100 
against Denver but if the oddsmakers had
opened<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.130> at<00:02:23.250> 7:00<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.360> Denver<00:02:24.840> would<00:02:24.990> be

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
opened that at 7:00 then Denver would be

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.180 
opened that at 7:00 then Denver would be
the<00:02:25.230> Sharps<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.560> would<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.710> nothing<00:02:25.890> but

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the Sharps that would be nothing but

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.650 
the Sharps that would be nothing but
Denver<00:02:26.520> money<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.060> gonna<00:02:27.210> go<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> eight

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
Denver money it was gonna go to eight

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.410 
Denver money it was gonna go to eight
and<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> half<00:02:27.900> regardless<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.000> think

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
and a half regardless and I and I think

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940 
and a half regardless and I and I think
it's<00:02:30.540> comical<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> people<00:02:31.680> are<00:02:31.800> like

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it's comical that people are like

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.980 
it's comical that people are like
drawing<00:02:32.310> conclusions<00:02:32.580> based<00:02:33.240> upon<00:02:33.540> live<00:02:33.780> like

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
drawing conclusions based upon live like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.390 
drawing conclusions based upon live like
the<00:02:34.080> New<00:02:34.200> England<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.130> we<00:02:35.250> call

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the New England you know this we call

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.130 
the New England you know this we call
New<00:02:35.550> England's<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.940> sharp<00:02:36.150> side<00:02:36.360> against

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
New England's the sharp side against

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.930 
New England's the sharp side against
Denver<00:02:37.350> well<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.010> because<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> started<00:02:38.820> at

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
Denver well it's because it started at

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
Denver well it's because it started at
six<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.360> because<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> line<00:02:40.290> was<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.860> be

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
six now because the line was going to be

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.070 
six now because the line was going to be
four<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.400> half<00:02:41.430> regardless<00:02:42.150> yeah<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.990> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
four and a half regardless yeah and I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
four and a half regardless yeah and I
think<00:02:43.140> maybe<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.860> more<00:02:44.070> accurate<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.580> say<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
think maybe it's more accurate to say a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.050 
think maybe it's more accurate to say a
sharp<00:02:45.690> bet<00:02:46.050> was<00:02:46.590> getting<00:02:46.890> New<00:02:47.010> England<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.490> six

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
sharp bet was getting New England at six

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.910 
sharp bet was getting New England at six
because<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.720> New<00:02:48.960> England<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.410> four<00:02:49.650> or<00:02:49.770> four

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because now New England at four or four

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.530 
because now New England at four or four
and<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> half<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:50.460> really<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> sharp<00:02:51.270> bet

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
and a half is not really a sharp bet

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
and a half is not really a sharp bet
anymore<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> mean<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.550> back<00:02:53.580> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
anymore well I mean again I go back to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.790 
anymore well I mean again I go back to
it's<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.300> sharpest<00:02:54.870> bet<00:02:55.110> think<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:55.710> you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
it's not the sharpest bet think if you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.940 
it's not the sharpest bet think if you
had<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.280> good<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:57.390> know<00:02:57.540> three<00:02:58.230> hours<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.770> grab

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
had a good you know three hours to grab

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.980 
had a good you know three hours to grab
plus<00:02:59.340> six<00:02:59.640> when<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.880> first<00:03:00.150> came<00:03:00.390> actually<00:03:00.660> six

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
plus six when I first came actually six

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.840 
plus six when I first came actually six
and<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> half<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.340> was<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.460> plus

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
and a half I think there was one plus

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.250 
and a half I think there was one plus
seven<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.330> realistically<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:03.990> an<00:03:04.110> hour

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
seven but realistically we have an hour

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.870 
seven but realistically we have an hour
to<00:03:04.470> get<00:03:04.530> six<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.830> half<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.460> had<00:03:05.550> about<00:03:05.700> two

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
to get six and half you had about two

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030 
to get six and half you had about two
hours<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.300> get<00:03:06.420> plus<00:03:06.660> six<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.140> then<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.950> know

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
hours to get plus six and then you know

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.040 
hours to get plus six and then you know
they<00:03:08.190> once<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.090> goes<00:03:09.210> into<00:03:09.390> five<00:03:09.630> five<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.020> a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
they once it goes into five five and a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.570 
they once it goes into five five and a
half<00:03:10.140> four<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> half<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.770> equate<00:03:11.310> those<00:03:11.520> two

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
half four and a half I equate those two

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.760 
half four and a half I equate those two
all<00:03:11.820> be<00:03:12.060> about<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.480> same<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:13.290> yet<00:03:13.410> people

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
all be about the same but yet people

anything<00:04:43.700> like<00:04:43.970> there<00:04:44.180> was<00:04:44.330> last<00:04:44.660> weekend

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
anything like there was last weekend

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.080

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090

against San Diego but I think people can
also<00:04:47.300> take<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.720> look<00:04:47.930> at<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.200> Denver<00:04:48.560> effort

a<00:06:13.370> half<00:06:13.460> because<00:06:13.700> they<00:06:14.000> were<00:06:14.060> good<00:06:14.360> they<00:06:14.390> were

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
a half because they were good they were

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.660 
a half because they were good they were
too<00:06:14.840> late<00:06:15.050> eight<00:06:15.200> and<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.410> half<00:06:15.440> back<00:06:15.950> when<00:06:16.190> when

too late eight and a half back when when

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.220 
too late eight and a half back when when
it<00:06:16.760> was<00:06:16.880> so<00:06:17.090> much<00:06:17.270> cheaper<00:06:17.780> and<00:06:17.990> they<00:06:18.140> would

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
it was so much cheaper and they would

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
it was so much cheaper and they would
have<00:06:18.320> been<00:06:18.350> ahead<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.770> curve<00:06:18.920> not<00:06:19.100> the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
have been ahead of the curve not the

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.740 
have been ahead of the curve not the

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
bit careful there are like college

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.660 
bit careful there are like college
basketball<00:06:27.650> totals<00:06:28.100> that<00:06:28.250> people<00:06:28.580> are

playing over 156 that opened 149 and

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.480 
playing over 156 that opened 149 and
they<00:06:32.780> still<00:06:33.110> have<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.410> right<00:06:33.440> side<00:06:33.890> there's

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
they still have the right side there's

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.890 
they still have the right side there's
an<00:06:34.700> example<00:06:35.000> where<00:06:35.120> the<00:06:35.270> opening<00:06:35.690> number

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
an example where the opening number

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.180 
an example where the opening number
could<00:06:36.230> just<00:06:36.410> sit<00:06:36.620> out<00:06:36.770> there

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
could just sit out there

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.000 
could just sit out there
forever<00:06:37.460> and<00:06:37.760> be<00:06:38.150> completely<00:06:39.020> wrong<00:06:39.770> there

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
forever and be completely wrong there

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.980 
forever and be completely wrong there
