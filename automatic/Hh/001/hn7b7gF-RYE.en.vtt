00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.040
 well let's start doing a review 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.520
 of what the structure of the scale was 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.870
 higher 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.870
 remember we had to have 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 all halftone tones all all everything 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 halftone, two halftones 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.970
 three tones a semitone is the structure 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.800
 of the major scale 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.000
 let's take for example the scale of 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.730
 the flat major let's build the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.530
 let's advance two tones 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.410
 one 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.000
 two 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 and a semitone 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:54.940
 12 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.940
 three tones and a semitone then 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.850
 Y 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.850
 already 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.360
 and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.490
 then we believe the scale of the tree 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.150
 we can take another scale as fa 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.150
 senior sustained 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.480
 the halftone tones a tone 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.050
 or not 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.830
 all that myth 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.830
 so 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 and 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.410
 and usually the scales that go with 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.970
 Sharp start with finger two 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:55.010
 because if it can be a possibility but 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:00.880
 remember that sometimes you have to start 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.880
 with the fingers in some is by aida 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.149
 happens that this would be a bit uncomfortable 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.450
 to use the same fingering as the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.720
 scale of 2 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 then here 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.140
 faster 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.200
 okay it's on the major scales two 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.110
 tones a semitone three tones and eleven 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.300
 half 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.300
 let's see now 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.890
 then how are the 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.890
 minor scales
