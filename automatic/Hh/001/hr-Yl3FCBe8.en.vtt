a smooth rhythm sound it's best in the
beginning<00:00:31.570> stages<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:32.079> use<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.230> pick<00:00:32.590> that's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
beginning stages to use a pick that's

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.729 
beginning stages to use a pick that's
slightly<00:00:33.340> thin<00:00:33.970> it's<00:00:34.510> easier<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.350> get<00:00:35.470> a<00:00:35.530> nice

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
slightly thin it's easier to get a nice

slightly thin it's easier to get a nice
smooth<00:00:36.070> sound<00:00:36.460> I<00:00:36.730> like<00:00:37.270> to<00:00:37.329> use<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.600> medium<00:00:37.989> pick

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
smooth sound I like to use a medium pick

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.890 
smooth sound I like to use a medium pick
though<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.489> lot<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:39.940> beginners<00:00:40.210> use<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> thin

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
though a lot of beginners use a thin

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.770 
though a lot of beginners use a thin
pick<00:00:41.699> however<00:00:42.699> when<00:00:43.000> you're<00:00:43.089> playing<00:00:43.300> melody

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
pick however when you're playing melody

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.119 
pick however when you're playing melody
it's<00:00:43.960> kind<00:00:44.230> of<00:00:44.320> better<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.650> have<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.800> stiffer

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
it's kind of better to have a stiffer

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's kind of better to have a stiffer
pick<00:00:45.430> as<00:00:45.610> you<00:00:46.000> get<00:00:46.150> more<00:00:46.269> experienced<00:00:46.960> it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
pick as you get more experienced it's

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.049 
pick as you get more experienced it's
easier<00:00:47.470> to<00:00:47.710> get<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.890> smooth<00:00:48.250> sound<00:00:48.550> with<00:00:49.030> a

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
easier to get a smooth sound with a

easier to get a smooth sound with a
stiffer<00:00:49.420> pick<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.440> right<00:00:50.680> now<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:50.890> have<00:00:51.160> a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
stiffer pick so right now I have a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.549 
stiffer pick so right now I have a
medium<00:00:51.460> read<00:00:52.089> pick<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.600> chose<00:00:52.989> red<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:53.409> it's

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
medium read pick I chose red so it's

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.770 
medium read pick I chose red so it's
easy<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.829> see<00:00:54.159> let's<00:00:54.730> focus<00:00:54.940> in<00:00:55.210> on<00:00:55.360> a<00:00:55.420> little

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
easy to see let's focus in on a little

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
easy to see let's focus in on a little
bit<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.930> here's<00:00:58.930> my<00:00:59.140> pick<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.649> have<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.949> medium

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
bit so here's my pick I have a medium

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.859 
bit so here's my pick I have a medium
pick<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.629> I'm<00:01:02.440> going<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.340> put<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.789> pick<00:01:04.059> on<00:01:04.300> my

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
pick and I'm going to put the pick on my

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.900 
pick and I'm going to put the pick on my
first<00:01:05.289> knuckle<00:01:05.800> on<00:01:06.130> my<00:01:06.280> finger

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
first knuckle on my finger

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.200 
first knuckle on my finger
can<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:07.840> see<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.500> then<00:01:09.490> place<00:01:09.729> my<00:01:09.910> thumb

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
can you see that and then place my thumb

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
can you see that and then place my thumb
over<00:01:10.450> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
over it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.790 
over it
now<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.280> real<00:01:12.820> key<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:14.140> put<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> little<00:01:14.590> more

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
now the real key is to put a little more

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.650 
now the real key is to put a little more
pressure<00:01:15.130> on<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.610> back<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.240> pick<00:01:16.479> as

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
pressure on the back of the pick as

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.169 
pressure on the back of the pick as
opposed<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.410> front<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.759> in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.970> back<00:01:19.149> of

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
opposed to the front so in the back of

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.540 
opposed to the front so in the back of
the<00:01:19.390> pick<00:01:19.539> it<00:01:19.660> allows<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.200> pick<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.770> wobble<00:01:21.100> a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
the pick it allows to pick to wobble a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.139 
the pick it allows to pick to wobble a
little<00:01:21.820> bit<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.590> still<00:01:24.039> keeps<00:01:24.640> from<00:01:24.820> falling

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
little bit but still keeps from falling

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.859 
little bit but still keeps from falling
out<00:01:25.270> now<00:01:25.990> there's<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.320> balance<00:01:27.130> there<00:01:27.399> between

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
out now there's a balance there between

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.070 
out now there's a balance there between
making<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:29.340> wobble<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.750> slipping<00:01:31.750> out<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.899> your

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
making a wobble and slipping out of your

making a wobble and slipping out of your
hand<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:33.130> course<00:01:33.429> if<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:33.759> don't<00:01:34.270> put<00:01:34.479> enough

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
hand of course if you don't put enough

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.089 
hand of course if you don't put enough
pressure<00:01:34.959> it's<00:01:35.289> going<00:01:35.349> to<00:01:35.500> fall<00:01:35.679> right<00:01:35.890> out

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
pressure it's going to fall right out

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.249 
pressure it's going to fall right out
but<00:01:36.700> if<00:01:36.789> you<00:01:36.849> put<00:01:37.000> too<00:01:37.030> much<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.720> choke<00:01:37.959> up<00:01:38.110> on

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
but if you put too much and choke up on

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.139 
but if you put too much and choke up on
the<00:01:38.410> pick<00:01:38.679> you<00:01:39.130> can<00:01:39.160> hold<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.670> better<00:01:39.849> but

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the pick you can hold it better but

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.790 
the pick you can hold it better but
it'll<00:01:40.390> be<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.649> tight<00:01:42.360> rough<00:01:43.360> strum<00:01:43.780> see<00:01:44.619> here's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
it'll be a tight rough strum see here's

which<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.690> stiff<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.220> heavy

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
which is stiff this is a really heavy

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.449 
which is stiff this is a really heavy
pick<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:39.170> great<00:02:39.379> for<00:02:39.530> melodies<00:02:42.459> however

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
pick and it's great for melodies however

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.949 
pick and it's great for melodies however
it's<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.849> little<00:02:44.060> harder<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.450> play<00:02:44.629> smooth

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it's a little harder to play smooth

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.289 
it's a little harder to play smooth
rhythm<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.650> really<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.400> back<00:02:46.849> up<00:02:46.879> on<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
rhythm I really have to back up on the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.199 
rhythm I really have to back up on the
back<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.629> pick<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.019> let<00:02:48.110> it<00:02:48.260> wobble<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:49.209> can

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
back of the pick and let it wobble I can

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.550 
back of the pick and let it wobble I can
do<00:02:50.359> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
do it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.280 
do it
it's<00:02:52.560> harder<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.390> experiment

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
it's harder so you can experiment

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.929 
it's harder so you can experiment
I<00:02:58.379> recommend<00:02:59.099> again<00:02:59.370> starting<00:02:59.790> with<00:02:59.819> a

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
I recommend again starting with a

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.819 
I recommend again starting with a
thinner<00:03:00.239> pick<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.379> want<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.650> try<00:03:01.799> a

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
thinner pick but if you want to try a

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.009 
thinner pick but if you want to try a
thicker<00:03:02.129> pick<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.670> experiment<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.599> little

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
thicker pick just experiment a little

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.839 
thicker pick just experiment a little
bit<00:03:04.200> as<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.040> experience<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.640> course

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
bit as you get more experience of course

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.440 
bit as you get more experience of course
