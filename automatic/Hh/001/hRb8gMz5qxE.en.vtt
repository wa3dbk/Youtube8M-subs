00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.510
 Hello everyone, today we'll see how to prepare 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.490
 a delicious vegetarian first course 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:15.259
 risotto with credits we go to the kitchen 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.160
 in this video I will show you the doses 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.160
 for two people 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.560
 we must first cook a little 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.119
 courgettes so we take a pan 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.390
 pour in a little oil 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.789
 olive is a shallot cut into 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 small bits and we leave 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.820
 fry for about two minutes after 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 that we add a big zucchini 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.430
 cut into cubes and now we should 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 let it cook a little bit 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:54.309
 let's make it jump to do it well 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 toast after two or three minutes 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.399
 Bring them to three quarters of cooking 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.289
 no vegetable broth added 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.000
 it will take about 10 minutes 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.340
 if we want we can also add 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.630
 a handful of Taggiasca olives and per 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 give an even more intense flavor 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.000
 meanwhile we prepare the rice we take 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.000
 another pan we pour a little oil 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.650
 add the rice over high heat 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.250
 let's make it toast this way for a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.250
 couple of minutes 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.430
 now we have to add some broth 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.350
 vegetable we say that for two people 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 serve about 600 ml of broth 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 you see that rice absorbs a lot 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 liquids quickly 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.910
 the only shrewdness that we must keep to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.250
 mind is always to wet the rice 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.130
 because you don't have to dry you see that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.550
 I cover all the rice with del 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.210
 broth 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.860
 let's try to use pans 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 wide and low so that the rice does 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:11.070
 Cook it evenly and bring it to three 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.830
 cooking quarters you see that gradually 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.790
 which cooks ritual absorbs the broth and therefore 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.790
 it gets bigger 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 let's take a cup let's pour a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.000
 teaspoon of curry with a little bit 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.390
 I recommend water or cold broth 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.700
 we mix well to make the curry 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.750
 melt and very important that the spices 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 are dissolved in this way are 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.060
 after about 16 minutes my rice ea 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.799
 three quarters of cooking and now I go to 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:51.230
 add the zucchini with the olives and 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:55.349
 obviously also the dissolved curry 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 we mix well and bring it all to 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:02.750
 cooking let's jump a bit for 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.750
 flavor 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.349
 now all that remains is to whisk with a thread 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.660
 of oil you see that as he carried 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.310
 continue cooking rice or added 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.319
 some broth my rice is ready now I have to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.319
 just serve it and eat it good appetite
