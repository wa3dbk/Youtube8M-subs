rough opening you can see that here here
it<00:01:00.749> was<00:01:00.870> done<00:01:01.019> with<00:01:01.199> fast<00:01:01.440> flash<00:01:01.769> that's<00:01:02.280> by

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it was done with fast flash that's by

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.579 
it was done with fast flash that's by
Pro<00:01:02.789> SoCo<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> method<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.320> strongly

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
helps to drain out any moisture that

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.670 
helps to drain out any moisture that
might<00:01:11.010> accumulate<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.670> later<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.680> now

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
might accumulate there later on now

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
if you have them installed and then you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.789 
if you have them installed and then you
can<00:01:27.659> install<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> window<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> inside
