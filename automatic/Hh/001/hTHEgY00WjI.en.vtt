00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I think all of them are in the night of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880

course<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> his<00:00:54.600> stats<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.050> 99<00:00:55.410> that

might<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.489> chemistry<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> think

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
