to me well somebody I guess must have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.550 
to me well somebody I guess must have
thought<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:10.380> something

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
thought that there was something

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
thought that there was something
valuable<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.520> opened<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
valuable in there and they opened up the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.340 
valuable in there and they opened up the
thing<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> took<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.710> manifold<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:15.900> won't

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
thing and took the manifold so I won't

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
thing and took the manifold so I won't
be<00:01:16.500> using<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.920> engine<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
be using that engine but I do have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.289 
be using that engine but I do have
another<00:01:19.200> trick<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.799> my<00:01:19.830> sleeve

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
another trick up my sleeve

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
another trick up my sleeve
so<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.750> started<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so and then also I started on the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.160 
so and then also I started on the
interior<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> center

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
interior a little bit with the center

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.520 
interior a little bit with the center

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
tire to put on those so that's that the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340 
tire to put on those so that's that the
48<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.540> sitting<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.079> primer

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
48 is just sitting there and primer

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.539 
48 is just sitting there and primer
ready<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:05.070> paint

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
ready for paint

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.550 
ready for paint
I<00:02:05.670> had<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> painted<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.200> threw<00:02:07.439> up

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
I had it painted I threw up

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040 
I had it painted I threw up
design<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:11.270> wasn't<00:02:11.660> happy<00:02:11.930> with

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
design on it and I wasn't happy with

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.220 
design on it and I wasn't happy with
Daniel<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.470> could<00:02:12.620> do<00:02:12.740> better

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
Daniel I could do better

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.150 
Daniel I could do better
so<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:16.060> stripped<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.180> down<00:02:17.680> reprime<00:02:18.680> with<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
so I stripped it down reprime with it so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.960 
so I stripped it down reprime with it so
that's<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.550> kneading<00:02:19.850> pain<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.850> also<00:02:24.970> over

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's just kneading pain and also over

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.880 
that's just kneading pain and also over
there<00:02:26.150> let's<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.959> zoom<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:29.890> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
there let's see if I can zoom in you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.770 
there let's see if I can zoom in you
really<00:02:31.040> can't<00:02:31.370> see<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.640> too<00:02:31.850> well<00:02:31.880> as<00:02:32.390> my

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
really can't see it too well as my

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.520 
really can't see it too well as my
