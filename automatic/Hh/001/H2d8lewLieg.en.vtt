00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
by Euro challenge I think so I mean a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580 
by Euro challenge I think so I mean a
lot<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.340> stuff<00:02:51.519> like<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.320> get

played<00:03:01.510> against<00:03:03.390> these<00:03:04.390> races<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.200> is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
played against these races this is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.430 
played against these races this is
caught<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.350> comparing<00:03:08.350> us

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
caught this is it in like comparing us

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.590 
caught this is it in like comparing us
down<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.920> reason<00:03:09.850> we<00:03:09.940> were<00:03:10.000> successful<00:03:10.360> that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
down and reason we were successful that

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.199 
down and reason we were successful that
game<00:03:10.780> cuz<00:03:11.019> we<00:03:11.140> got<00:03:11.260> stops<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:13.090> was

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
game cuz we got stops like it was

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.720 
game cuz we got stops like it was
tougher<00:03:13.570> than<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.870> score<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.470> that's<00:03:15.430> why<00:03:15.579> we

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
tougher than the score and that's why we

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.120 
tougher than the score and that's why we
had<00:03:15.940> success<00:03:16.360> offensive<00:03:17.170> come<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.470> go

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
had success offensive come and go

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.800 
had success offensive come and go
