00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
really aren't too much to note except

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
really aren't too much to note except
they<00:01:36.270> let<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.600> carry<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:37.200> molotovs<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
probably the better two and they're the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.770 
probably the better two and they're the
ones<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.710> unique<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.340> him<00:01:44.520> anyways<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
ones that are unique to him anyways the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
ones that are unique to him anyways the
whole<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.290> whole<00:01:46.320> left<00:01:46.710> side<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.250> his<00:01:47.430> tree

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
whole the whole left side of his tree

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
whole the whole left side of his tree
seems<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.689> built<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.259> damage

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
seems like it's built more for damage

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.880 
seems like it's built more for damage
than<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.840> staying<00:01:52.170> alive<00:01:52.560> however

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
than it is for for staying alive however

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.639 
than it is for for staying alive however
the<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.430> side<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.970> definitely<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:55.380> for

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the right side is definitely more for

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.660 
the right side is definitely more for
staying<00:01:55.920> alive<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.820> for

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
staying alive than it is for

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.820 
staying alive than it is for
even<00:01:58.270> though<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.140> other<00:01:59.290> two<00:01:59.530> characters

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
even though the the other two characters

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.300 
even though the the other two characters
Abby<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:00.910> Jack<00:02:01.210> they<00:02:01.480> have<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.720> better

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
