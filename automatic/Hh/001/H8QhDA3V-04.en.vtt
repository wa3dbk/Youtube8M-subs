ratchet<00:00:14.970> I<00:00:15.240> picked<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.660> recently<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
ratchet I picked up recently and

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
ratchet I picked up recently and
actually<00:00:17.130> got<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.370> at<00:00:17.550> Walmart<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.060> found

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
actually got this at Walmart I found

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.380 
actually got this at Walmart I found
this<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.960> their<00:00:19.290> tool<00:00:20.070> department<00:00:20.700> and<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this at their tool department and the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.120 
this at their tool department and the
cool<00:00:21.600> thing<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.050> ratchet<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.950> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
cool thing about this ratchet is that it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.689 
cool thing about this ratchet is that it
has<00:00:23.340> both<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:24.060> flexible<00:00:24.990> head<00:00:25.200> and<00:00:25.550> also<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
has both a flexible head and also the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
has both a flexible head and also the
handle<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.270> extended<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.050> increase<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
handle can be extended to increase the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.220 
handle can be extended to increase the
leverage<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.520> you're<00:00:29.670> using<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:30.150> now<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> do

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
leverage when you're using this now I do

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.729 
leverage when you're using this now I do
have<00:00:31.619> other<00:00:31.949> ones<00:00:32.340> similar<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:34.019> my<00:00:34.230> toolbox

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have other ones similar in my toolbox

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.189 
have other ones similar in my toolbox
like<00:00:35.069> this<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:35.999> with<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.269> flexible<00:00:36.899> head

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
like this one here with a flexible head

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.759 
like this one here with a flexible head
this<00:00:38.039> one<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.579> Harbor<00:00:39.179> Freight<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.769> also

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
this one is from Harbor Freight and also

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.180 
this one is from Harbor Freight and also
this<00:00:40.979> one<00:00:41.249> here<00:00:41.609> has<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:43.019> handle<00:00:43.949> that<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.129> can

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
this one here has a handle that you can

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.149 
this one here has a handle that you can
extend<00:00:44.699> to<00:00:44.969> increase<00:00:45.929> the<00:00:46.079> leverage<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
extend to increase the leverage but the

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.239 
extend to increase the leverage but the
head<00:00:47.339> doesn't<00:00:47.789> flex<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.859> one<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:50.249 
head doesn't flex so this one is

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.069 
head doesn't flex so this one is
combination<00:00:50.819> of<00:00:50.909> both<00:00:51.089> of<00:00:51.149> these<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.929> that's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
combination of both of these so that's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
combination of both of these so that's
why<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.409> was<00:00:52.710> interested<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.129> getting<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.579> one

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
why I was interested in getting this one

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.059 
why I was interested in getting this one
and<00:00:54.030> perhaps<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.109> might<00:00:55.350> replace<00:00:55.769> both<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:56.069 
and perhaps this might replace both of

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:58.309 
and perhaps this might replace both of
these<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.940> here's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.049> packaging

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
these so here's a look of the packaging

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.599 
these so here's a look of the packaging
and<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.609> part<00:00:59.909> number<00:01:00.209> on<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.659> STM<00:01:01.609> t7

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and the part number on this is STM t7

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.539 
and the part number on this is STM t7
two<00:01:02.789> four<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.179> eight<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:05.039> retail<00:01:05.339> price

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
two four one eight and the retail price

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
two four one eight and the retail price
for<00:01:05.789> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.180> about<00:01:06.479> twenty<00:01:06.840> dollars<00:01:07.200> there's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
for this is about twenty dollars there's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.850 
for this is about twenty dollars there's
not<00:01:07.860> too<00:01:08.009> much<00:01:08.159> has<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> lifetime<00:01:08.969> warranty<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
not too much has a lifetime warranty and

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.889 
not too much has a lifetime warranty and
here's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> let<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.539> open<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
here's a back of it so let me open this

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:24.980 
here's a back of it so let me open this
up

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.120 

let's<00:01:25.990> go<00:01:26.110> over<00:01:26.320> some<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.650> features<00:01:26.800> on

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
let's go over some of the features on

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.100 
let's go over some of the features on
this<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.060> as<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.360> see<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.870> head<00:01:29.080> is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
this so as you can see the head is

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.040 
this so as you can see the head is
flexible<00:01:29.910> so<00:01:30.910> you<00:01:30.970> can<00:01:31.060> turn<00:01:31.330> this<00:01:31.600> all<00:01:31.840> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
flexible so you can turn this all the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.710 
flexible so you can turn this all the
way<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.230> this<00:01:32.650> angle<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:36.010> angle<00:01:36.510> now<00:01:37.510> one

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
way to this angle or this angle now one

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.120 
way to this angle or this angle now one
thing<00:01:37.870> nice<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.830> there<00:01:39.040> is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
thing nice about this is that there is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.790 
thing nice about this is that there is
actually<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.760> button<00:01:40.210> here<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.869> lock<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.680> in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
actually a button here to lock it in

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.120 
actually a button here to lock it in
place<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.580> if<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:42.850> set<00:01:43.150> it<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.479> angle<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.290> I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
place so if I set it to this angle and I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.080 
place so if I set it to this angle and I
press<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.729> button<00:01:46.000> down<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:47.500> will<00:01:47.650> lock<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
press this button down it will lock that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.710 
press this button down it will lock that
flexible<00:01:49.570> head<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.440> position<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:52.510> once

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
flexible head in that position and once

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.469 
flexible head in that position and once
you<00:01:52.840> release<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:54.640> change<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.030> position

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
you release it and you change a position

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.969 
you release it and you change a position
again<00:01:56.670> default<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.820> reverse<00:01:58.149> lever<00:01:58.979> very

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
again default and reverse lever very

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.990 
again default and reverse lever very
easy<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.460> switch<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:01.810> smooth<00:02:02.580> if<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.790> want

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
easy to switch very smooth if you want

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.880 
easy to switch very smooth if you want
to<00:02:04.060> put<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> socket<00:02:04.540> on<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.810> press<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.500> center

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
to put a socket on it press the center

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.240 
to put a socket on it press the center
button<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:06.340> at<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.610> top<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.860> although<00:02:09.100> you

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
button here at the top and although you

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.949 
button here at the top and although you
to<00:02:09.520> put<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.759> socket<00:02:10.000> on<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> did<00:02:13.300> count<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
to put the socket on now I did count the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.590 
to put the socket on now I did count the
number<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.320> teeth<00:02:14.739> inside<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.880> ratchet

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
number of teeth inside this ratchet

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.430 
number of teeth inside this ratchet
mechanism<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.320> as<00:02:18.070> 44<00:02:18.730> teeth<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> lot

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
mechanism and as 44 teeth it's not a lot

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
mechanism and as 44 teeth it's not a lot
because<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.070> other<00:02:21.280> two<00:02:21.640> ratchet<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.360> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
because the other two ratchet that you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.449 
because the other two ratchet that you
saw<00:02:22.630> earlier<00:02:23.020> from<00:02:23.620> Harbor<00:02:23.950> Freight<00:02:23.980> they

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
saw earlier from Harbor Freight they

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.360 
saw earlier from Harbor Freight they

both have 72 teeth so give you a little

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.910 
both have 72 teeth so give you a little
more<00:02:27.550> control<00:02:28.000> when<00:02:28.480> you're<00:02:28.630> using<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.170> but

this one again is only 44 teeth inside
if<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.430> want<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.670> release<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.120> socket<00:02:34.480> press

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
if you want to release the socket press

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.590 
if you want to release the socket press
the<00:02:35.320> center<00:02:35.709> button<00:02:35.920> here<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> socket

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
the center button here and the socket

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.920 
the center button here and the socket
will<00:02:37.690> come<00:02:37.840> out<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:40.150> look<00:02:40.269> at<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> overall

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
will come out let's look at the overall

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.789 
will come out let's look at the overall
length<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.560> if<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.640> measure<00:02:42.970> from<00:02:43.799> the

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
length of this if I measure from the

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.039 
length of this if I measure from the
center<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.910> socket<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.660> end<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
center of the socket to the end of the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.289 
center of the socket to the end of the
handle<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:48.489> measures<00:02:49.030> 10<00:02:49.780> inches<00:02:51.209> let<00:02:52.209> me

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
handle this measures 10 inches let me

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.009 
handle this measures 10 inches let me
extend<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.930> all<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.799> way<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.989> when<00:02:55.989> I

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
extend this all the way out and when I

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.370 
extend this all the way out and when I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
a regular 3/8 inch ratchet that came out

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.030 
a regular 3/8 inch ratchet that came out
of<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.360> set<00:03:53.599> this<00:03:53.900> one<00:03:54.079> is<00:03:54.200> made<00:03:54.379> by<00:03:54.409> Crescent

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
of a set this one is made by Crescent

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280 
of a set this one is made by Crescent
and<00:03:55.190> as<00:03:55.879> you<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.090> see<00:03:56.329> there's<00:03:56.599> no<00:03:56.780> flexible

one measures 7 inches so that's how it
compares<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:05.120> Stanley<00:04:05.599> one<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:07.040> here's

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
compares to this Stanley one and here's

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.309 
compares to this Stanley one and here's
