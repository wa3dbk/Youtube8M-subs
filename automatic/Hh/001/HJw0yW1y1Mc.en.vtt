00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 for the muffins we are going to need 230 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.890
 grams of flour 50 grams good in this 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.000
 case a white chocolate bar 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.399
 We are going to need 80 oil 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 grams if it is olive better if not then 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:55.430
 of which you have ok 2 eggs a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.629
 natural yogurt and sugar we are going to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.750
 need 150 grams good now yes 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.879
 let's start in a bowl let's put 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.549
 first all the dry ingredients what 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.939
 which is sugar flour and forgot to tell them 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.010
 an envelope of yeast on this side 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.759
 we are going to incorporate what is being 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.250
 yogurt eggs oil and chocolate 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.720
 previously melted this already as 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.060
 I have said in several videos how 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.840
 you want to melt it bain marie or 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.020
 in the microwave since we have it right 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.329
 mixed one I create liquid and the other one with 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.880
 the solids well now we mix 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.880
 both and we move with gentle movements and 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.159
 envelopes for three minutes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960
 this is the consistency that has us 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.289
 to stay if they realize when 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.590
 you start to move you will have a 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.530
 little bit hard that's how it is or thicker 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.560
 well express good we already have here 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.770
 emptied is not this mixture especially 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.920
 to bake it's going to be at 200 degrees 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.590
 for 25 minutes you already know to know that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.290
 now we put the stick if it does not come out 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.810
 dry is that they are already 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.570
 good to do our ladybugs 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.790
 we are going to need this mass that is called 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.560
 funda that is already well known by all 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.110
 world have already seen their sets of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.070
 so beautiful cakes because I know this 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.780
 mass called fondant and good I'm going 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.460
 to tell a lot of people where they can 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.680
 find then basically in all 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.450
 these pastry shops there is where 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.300
 you can find it there are very people 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.070
 craftsman who does it but the truth is 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.960
 I do not recommend it 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.050
 I sincerely prefer to buy the 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.950
 pasta and make it so good this already 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.830
 is done and we are going to buy everything 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 a pack of fondant a little bit of 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.440
 icing sugar we're going to need coloring 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.360
 for black food and red coloring and with 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.770
 a roller of preference that is of 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.840
 this type 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.390
 The first thing we 're going to do is 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.830
 put on a clean and flat surface 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.190
 a little icing sugar and cut 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 well basically less than half of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.060
 package 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.460
 the importance of icing sugar is that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.470
 It gives us softness and what was hard before 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is getting soft as if it were 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220
 clay 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 with the help of some sticks we are going to put 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.060
 our our sticks in the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 coloring and we will go putting little to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.000
 little we do not add too much because 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.650
 often depends the dye can 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.840
 paint more or less and knead again 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.630
 Well now I'm painting the color 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.400
 red and well I want to give you here a tip 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.320
 because it is what is happening to me and 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 I do not want you to worry about 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.900
 if it happens to them what happens when you put 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.030
 the paint hydrates the bottom and which 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.500
 it makes it stick it turns into taffy 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.560
 as if we were doing it 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.810
 do not really worry that's normal 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.180
 is going to be removed is going to start to remove 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.459
 already detach from the surface where 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.010
 they are kneading it but little by little 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.410
 when it is hydrated again and at the same time 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.600
 it dries then on the surface 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.299
 again we clean and sprinkle 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.340
 very little icing sugar and then what 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.830
 let's do it's going to be extend our 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.389
 mass and I really recommend that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.909
 is roller 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.300
 of plastic because if you are not going to 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:35.289
 paste and extend as much as we want 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.719
 be thin our our base ok 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.360
 The next thing we will do is with paper 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.879
 white kitchen and if we do not have a 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.189
 white sheet of paper cut the circle 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.139
 to the size of the mobile and this is going to be 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.180
 our reference to cut the 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.939
 circles in the background as they have been 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.680
 mind I've already cut the first one let's go 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:55.870
 to go circling around the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.569
 fondant once cut our 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.150
 circles what we will do is put it 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.700
 on our cell phone and we're hitting it 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.000
 in such a way that we cover all the mobile 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.280
 since we have the first circle we are going to 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.250
 make some cuts through in the middle of that 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.880
 circle as diagonal type in this way 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.660
 and we remove this one that is not going to serve us and 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.640
 then we'll make a circle around here that 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.849
 we are also going to remove good medium 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.459
 circle 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.259
 and this is what does not work for us and this 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.259
 let's move our muffin 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.539
 and we 're going to hit it now we'll do the 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.939
 spots with the fondant that has 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.919
 over black color let's make a 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:49.139
 ball in a circle and then we're going to 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.770
 crush so that we have their pints 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.360
 or its black spots 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.300
 well we finished our rich 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.990
 muffins already with our fund and we have 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.259
 made these delicious and delicious ladybugs 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.580
 or ladybugs as you best know her and 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.460
 Well, the truth is that 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.139
 great until you just eat them but 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.879
 They are super fun and we have very 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.710
 well especially for when we have a 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.750
 children's birthday and we do not want 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.340
 invest so much in a cake look at you 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.099
 you buy your case and you put a 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.990
 little bit of color and imagination at 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.580
 that gives and you can make great creations 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.439
 this is an idea you can do 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.289
 countless things with the fondant and the 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.180
 truth is that it tastes delicious I hope 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.490
 Like this time I do not want to try it 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.099
 because the truth makes me give me a little 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.990
 of cut and grief that are so pretty and 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.389
 bite them in front of you but 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.340
 Of course I'll eat them and well, that's 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.470
 thank you very much for watching a kitchen 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.720
