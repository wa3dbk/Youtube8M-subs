pose<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.140> crotch<00:02:06.409> then<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> legs<00:02:09.020> get<00:02:10.020> them<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pose the crotch then the legs get them a

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:24.860 
pose the crotch then the legs get them a
nice<00:02:10.410> standard<00:02:10.860> position

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.880 

make<00:02:25.870> them<00:02:26.050> look<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.500> little<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.770> natural

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
make them look a little more natural

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.500 
make them look a little more natural
he's<00:02:27.520> kind<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.790> stuck<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> excel<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:31.360> we

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
he's kind of stuck on the excel there we

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.310 
he's kind of stuck on the excel there we
go<00:02:32.370> bend<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> arms<00:02:33.850> back<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> little<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.810> it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
go bend the arms back a little bit so it

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.590 
go bend the arms back a little bit so it
looks<00:02:35.470> more<00:02:35.650> natural

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
looks more natural

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.170 
looks more natural

uh-huh do the same with the other and
you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.390> your<00:02:46.690> basic<00:02:46.870> standing<00:02:47.560> pose<00:02:48.180> okay

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
you have your basic standing pose okay

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.290
