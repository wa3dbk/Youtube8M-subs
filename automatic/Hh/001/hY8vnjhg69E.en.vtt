 good at the RWTH computer 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.739
 and do a lot of great things with it and I would like some little things 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.709
 demonstrate 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.980
 when he could get here then the annus percent Kate for 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.300
 that goes to federal or state injured by our daughter Molly Autohof 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.839
 because that is otherwise easy costs 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.119
 that's our program 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 Zimmerli days leave tax here 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.180

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.580
 Speiser municipal and praised part of the subsoil 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.580

 that's easy to come with both tenth Klaus Heitmann and listen 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.400

 and this closer to two among many 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.870
 so Klose was firmly in the mood for something a bit off the tarmac 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.869
 slightly quieter 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 Cerberus is one's turn

 Children so very very cool 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.020
 so that was otherwise complex that made many programming or programming 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.230
 or you can barely too dramatically make a new bed of screaming child easy 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.220
 recognized at all 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 he does something 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560

 to it must sound evenly and in Dissen dynamic and 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.859

 if his call 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.569
 Imagine Wales under a sultry Kimberly just above 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.909

 What he said twice in the first have unfolded together 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.899
 Flatten and -third-fourth did not make Ammersee 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.499
