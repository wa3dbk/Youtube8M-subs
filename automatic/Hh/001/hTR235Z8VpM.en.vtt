00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:13.270
 He spends his life spends his life spends his life 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.289
 just as the current passes and everything 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.039
 forget and I walk indifferent where I 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 want to carry 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.730
 or not 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.730
 do not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.950
 the anc robots 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.180
 you already know that after rod zhang the great 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.140
 drones rod sang recommended the channel 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.870
 marginal medium the great 2 rod zhang 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.989
 subscribed to the margin channel to the average 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.030
 You already know if you did not already know 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.129
 you know why I want you 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.140
 to say is what you do not know nobody you do not 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:05.350
 you know it and nobody knows it is a matter 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.350
 It is also who cares 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.260
 because rose rock zhang recommended me 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.050
 channel and because when you subscribed to me 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.240
 channel also because he recommended to me 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.270
 channel on your recommendation of roseanne 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.530
 which says I recommend a channel that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.409
 I want you to see 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.200
 at this point who continue or not 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.240
 follow and sandro rosell and if you do not follow 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.659
 I do not tell it and another rose is someone 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.540
 not recommend anyone not 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.420
 I would recommend your own twin brother 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.369
 if I had one if it were not 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.369
 because he's going to get something out of it 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.020
 and in my case it was not less 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.390
 when you recommend the marginal channel 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.240
 mean says ah is an australian who lives 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.650
 in a Spanish that lives in australia blah 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.160
 blah blah blah blah blah also makes 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.260
 horror stories that escaped him what 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.960
 of also makes horror story is 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.570
 because link horror stories and 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.610
 I was never going to give credit to say something 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 how it makes horror stories better 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.140
 than mine because what I do is not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.880
 more than counting the creepy pastas or 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 tell you my way 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.650
 horror stories that I get out here and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.270
 over there and in fact we see the stories 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.130
 of marginal media terror because I 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.050
 I inspire them because the stories of 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.240
 marginal media terror 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.240
 they do not come from any side other than him 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.230
 they are genuine, so I 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.090
 information that I can draw from your 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.120
 horror stories as from other sides 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.400
 I recycle it from the internet and I tell you 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.910
 the marginal horror stories 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.630
 mean there you have the ones that the user 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.330
 turned sanz he was seeing there's more of 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.680
 20 are genuine, you can not find them 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.340
 no side all leave here from here 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.430
 and from here and now there is another new series 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 that only two or three go and also 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.830
 they are also genuine to pierce them and 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.320
 compare you will not like it at best 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.890
 more than zhang pieces because the 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.680
 of thrones zhang is digested potato that 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.630
 I was already going a little while, but if 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 you want an experience 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.990
 one of terror there you have them street 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.300
 you have when another rose mentions what 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.510
 the horror stories he escapes 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.710
 he also makes horror stories to him 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.800
 escapes from rose mentions marginal middle 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:42.310
 five six seven days after I 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.390
 I would have uploaded the criticism to other forums 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.880
 although I had just started a series 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.830
 about criticizing bloggers because I saw 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.770
 this may interest people not what 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.290
 you knew then I did the criticism of others 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.680
 rosÃ¡n that I think was the third if it was 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.829
 the third I did and the plane and in this one 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.870
 I value you with four and a half stars 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.209
 that was more than what he had valued 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.680
 the two previous criticisms the first 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.799
 was to raise your nose the second I think 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 that was from luisito king felipe visited 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.530
 kingdom 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.880
 these two bloggers were ahead 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.070
 then of pink drone nhk 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.080
 but sanz when I recommend marginalized 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.970
 half what I was saying is go to 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.800
 see this user who has just done 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.720
 a criticism and you'll see right away you're going to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.990
 find with my criticism because he just 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.120
 of uploading one on me this criticism with the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.930
 which puts me ahead of these others 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.010
 users who were going by then 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.500
 on top of him 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.030
 talking about looking for ways to find fame 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.190
 more good because that's why he recommended them 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.350
 marginal media channel 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.870
 simply because he wanted me to see is 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.750
 this criticism so good that I had 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.850
 done about this user called bull 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.300
 rosso although he had as much potential as 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.370
 blogger then a year later for the 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.230
 same reason they asked me one thing now 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.210
 asks me the other one and I make this criticism and 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.190
 what happened has happened 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.530
 pain the suns despite that criticism 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.800
 that's why I recommend you but in that 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.620
 moment is not recommended, do not subscribe 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.240
 to the marginal media channel subscribe 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.490
 the brand channel does not mean anything 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.070
 months later like eight more months 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.770
 late it was signed five months ago that 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.340
 it was the moment that was the moment that I 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.790
 I started to create another new product the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.610
 short documentaries the stories of 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.860
 terror I saw them to acquire 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.130
 information and recycle material that 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.380
 could inspire but subscribe to the 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.990
 moment that I start to create the 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.420
 product called short documentaries for 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.569
 to learn 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.819
 storytelling techniques 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.159
 and some trick that you can learn from 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.050
 edit or edit after 78 years 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.419
 here, I learned something, but neither 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490
 I am a star you can light more 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.669
 by other sides but the techniques of 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.669
 narration 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.270
 that's why he subscribes not to miss the 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.560
 it's more I can not tell you exactly in 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.380
 the video in which 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.290
 the red channel zhang subscribes marginal 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.940
 mean but but I think it 's this this is 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.650
 what pink is going to hate that that's why the 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.650
 to tell you that this is a video of 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.870
 quality and you can go check it yourself 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:41.090
 same if you come to digest a 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.150
 hamburger mack 2 and you're already a little 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.910
 tied and you want a luxury dessert 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.440
 from there because that probably at 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.750
 better I'm wrong is a video before a 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.470
 video later but I think it was that 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:57.620
 the video where rolls royce sang is 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.630
 subscribed to the middle marginal channel and 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.770
 about what happened later I tell you 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:06.410
 at another time click and compare if it is 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:12.040
 quality entertainment without necessity 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.040
 from being an error until next time
