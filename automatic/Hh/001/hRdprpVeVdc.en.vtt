this<00:00:00.210> is<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.510> first<00:00:00.810> time<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.709> the

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
this is the first time that the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.480 
this is the first time that the
sovereign<00:00:02.730> grant<00:00:03.360> has<00:00:03.840> been<00:00:04.460> interrogated<00:00:05.460> by

a<00:00:06.390> committee<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.930> parliament<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.970> I<00:00:08.970> think

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
a committee of parliament and I think

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.270 
a committee of parliament and I think
it's<00:00:09.630> been<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.840> really<00:00:09.990> helpful<00:00:10.260> exercise<00:00:10.710> in

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
it's been a really helpful exercise in

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999 
it's been a really helpful exercise in
opening<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.450> finances<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.139> public<00:00:13.710> account

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and also we have looked at whether or

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.269 
and also we have looked at whether or
not<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.430> queen<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.060> well<00:00:18.480> served<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
not the queen is well served by the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and I'm afraid we've come to the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.310 
and I'm afraid we've come to the
conclusion<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:27.119> things<00:00:27.660> could<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.109> better

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
need a lot of investment when we last

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
need a lot of investment when we last
looked<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> forty<00:00:51.989> percent<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
spending on them we think that figures

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
spending on them we think that figures
probably<00:00:57.480> gone<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.890> asked<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probably gone up but when we asked the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
probably gone up but when we asked the
royal<00:00:59.699> household<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:01.050> assessment<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.800> had

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

under<00:01:54.450> their<00:01:54.840> wing<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.710> think<00:01:56.280> both<00:01:56.579> Treasury

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
under their wing I think both Treasury

Palace<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> lived-in<00:02:35.220> palette<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.000> that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
Palace is a lived-in palette so that

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
Palace is a lived-in palette so that
things<00:02:36.360> are<00:02:36.510> different<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.260> nevertheless

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
things are different but nevertheless

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.410 
things are different but nevertheless
the<00:02:37.980> queen<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.390> time

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the queen is not there all of the time

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.780 
the queen is not there all of the time
and<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.320> think<00:02:40.380> more<00:02:40.830> income<00:02:41.340> could<00:02:41.610> be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
and I think more income could be

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.880 
and I think more income could be
generated<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:43.040> smarter<00:02:44.040> use<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.520> made<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
generated if smarter use was made of the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.960 
generated if smarter use was made of the
availability<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.220> palace<00:02:47.520> when<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
availability of the palace when the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.900 
availability of the palace when the
queen<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.240> not<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.720> residence
