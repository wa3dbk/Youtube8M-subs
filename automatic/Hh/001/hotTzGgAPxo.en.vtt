00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.309 
ride the blue line don't go above it
just<00:02:16.980> stay<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> blue<00:02:17.730> line<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:22.140> was

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
just stay on the blue line that was

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.080 
just stay on the blue line that was
really<00:02:22.709> good<00:02:22.950> because<00:02:23.160> eventually<00:02:23.670> she<00:02:24.060> got

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
really good because eventually she got

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.300 
really good because eventually she got
it<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:25.050> was<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> couple<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.590> times<00:02:25.709> where<00:02:26.160> she

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it there was a couple of times where she

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.949 
it there was a couple of times where she
just<00:02:26.519> lost<00:02:26.730> her<00:02:26.880> but<00:02:27.060> will<00:02:27.209> drop<00:02:27.420> down<00:02:27.599> again

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
just lost her but will drop down again

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.350 
just lost her but will drop down again
but<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.769> easier<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> safer<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> ride<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
but it's easier to safer to ride the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.199 
but it's easier to safer to ride the
track<00:02:30.660> than<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.410> ride<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.800> blue<00:02:32.640> safety

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
track than it is to ride the blue safety

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.530 
track than it is to ride the blue safety
zone<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.450> eventually<00:02:34.050> she<00:02:34.230> got<00:02:34.260> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140 

I<00:02:39.569> was<00:02:40.380> hanging<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> bike<00:02:41.610> oh<00:02:41.970> it's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I was hanging on to the bike oh it's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
I was hanging on to the bike oh it's
just<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.450> those<00:02:43.319> corners<00:02:43.799> it's<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> almost

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just like those corners it's it almost

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.410 
just like those corners it's it almost
like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> leap<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.880> faith

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
like a leap of faith

like a leap of faith
you<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.690> think<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.890> were<00:02:47.010> right<00:02:47.340> like

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
as soon as you said don't look down just

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.160 
as soon as you said don't look down just

80 miles an hour I was doing about 25
quite<00:03:07.080> happy<00:03:07.349> that<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.980> these<00:03:08.099> guys<00:03:08.720> start

going<00:03:09.959> around<00:03:10.200> 35<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:17.459> think<00:03:18.000> second<00:03:18.269> time<00:03:18.420> I'm

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
going around 35 I think second time I'm

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.910 
going around 35 I think second time I'm
going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> try<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.109> keep<00:03:19.200> my<00:03:19.350> arms<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.769> bit

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
going to try and keep my arms a bit

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910 
going to try and keep my arms a bit
looser<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.670> use<00:03:21.420> my<00:03:21.570> legs<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.989> my<00:03:22.109> butt<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.739> bit

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
looser and use my legs on my butt a bit

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.890 
looser and use my legs on my butt a bit
more<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.459> hold<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.269> bike<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.690> track

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
more to hold the bike on the track

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.509 
more to hold the bike on the track
rather<00:03:25.170> than<00:03:25.440> cut<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.799> really<00:03:26.040> tensing<00:03:26.489> my

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
rather than cut of really tensing my

00:03:26.519 --> 00:04:00.090 
rather than cut of really tensing my
arms

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.130 

I<00:04:01.230> was<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:02.440> went<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.760> much<00:04:03.790> faster<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:04.750> a<00:04:04.840> pack

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
I was like went so much faster in a pack

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.760 
I was like went so much faster in a pack
of<00:04:05.530> snakes<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.210> the<00:04:07.330> middle<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.900> on

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
of snakes it's like in the middle and on

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.230 
of snakes it's like in the middle and on
the<00:04:08.890> back<00:04:09.070> cuz<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.400> guess<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.730> use<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.880> slipstream

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
the back cuz I guess to use a slipstream

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.730 
the back cuz I guess to use a slipstream
behind<00:04:10.780> them<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.080> you<00:04:11.140> come<00:04:11.350> out<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
behind them and you come out of the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.380 
behind them and you come out of the
corners<00:04:12.190> much<00:04:12.520> faster<00:04:13.030> than<00:04:13.150> when<00:04:13.240> you're

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
corners much faster than when you're

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.840 
corners much faster than when you're
just<00:04:13.540> doing<00:04:13.720> on<00:04:13.870> your<00:04:13.990> own<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:15.190> proper<00:04:15.550> right

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
just doing on your own it's proper right

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.580 
just doing on your own it's proper right
it's<00:04:16.630> really<00:04:17.050> really<00:04:17.410> really<00:04:17.560> good<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:19.590> yeah

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
very very enjoyed it they run these

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.390 
very very enjoyed it they run these
one-hour<00:04:37.720> taster<00:04:38.170> sessions<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.010> think<00:04:39.250> it

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
one-hour taster sessions and I think it

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.860 
one-hour taster sessions and I think it
would<00:04:39.520> be<00:04:39.640> absolutely<00:04:40.120> brilliant<00:04:40.300> by<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.720> end

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
would be absolutely brilliant by the end

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.950 
would be absolutely brilliant by the end
of<00:04:41.020> 60<00:04:41.350> minutes<00:04:41.670> you<00:04:42.670> would<00:04:42.790> really<00:04:43.600> have<00:04:43.780> got
