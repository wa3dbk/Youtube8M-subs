00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
curls you know and this is a very I

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.229 
curls you know and this is a very I
guess<00:04:14.819> full<00:04:15.299> look<00:04:15.919> so<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.700> really<00:04:17.880> nice<00:04:18.180> that

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
guess full look so it's really nice that

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.960 
guess full look so it's really nice that
it<00:04:18.510> gives<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> lot<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.400> fullness<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.760> body
