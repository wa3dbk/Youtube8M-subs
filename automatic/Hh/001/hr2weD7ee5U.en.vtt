00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
and it runs through get the angle here

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:08.090 
and it runs through get the angle here
light<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:05.159> runs<00:01:05.400> through<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:07.409> shaft<00:01:07.770> right

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
light it runs through this shaft right

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.820 
light it runs through this shaft right
here<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> important<00:01:09.900> thing<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.260> note<00:01:10.530> is

that you can see there's this notch in
the<00:01:13.890> back<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> shaft<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:16.040> there's

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the back here of the shaft and there's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.190 
the back here of the shaft and there's
two<00:01:17.340> detents<00:01:18.770> here<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.880> side<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
two detents here on this side and you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
two detents here on this side and you
want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.530> sure<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> safety<00:01:24.210> lever

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
want to make sure that the safety lever

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
want to make sure that the safety lever
is<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.689> safe<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.619> never<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.040> both

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is on safe and you never take both

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
is on safe and you never take both
safety<00:01:26.729> levers<00:01:27.000> off<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> same<00:01:27.630> time<00:01:27.930> if

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
safety levers off at the same time if

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.200 
safety levers off at the same time if
you<00:01:28.560> take<00:01:28.740> both<00:01:28.920> safety<00:01:29.340> levers<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.060> can

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you take both safety levers off what can

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.170 
you take both safety levers off what can
happen<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.200> shaft<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.650> either<00:01:32.180> dislocate

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
happen is the shaft can either dislocate

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
happen is the shaft can either dislocate
because<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> levers<00:01:33.990> actually<00:01:34.290> hold<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because the levers actually hold it in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.120 
because the levers actually hold it in
place<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.509> shaft<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.079> get<00:01:37.200> misaligned<00:01:37.710> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
place or the shaft can get misaligned so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.880 
place or the shaft can get misaligned so
theoretically<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.939> could<00:01:39.119> install<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
theoretically you could install the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.440 
theoretically you could install the
levers<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> 180<00:01:41.820> degrees<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
levers on it at 180 degrees which is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
levers on it at 180 degrees which is
something<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.049> obviously<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
something we obviously don't want as the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
something we obviously don't want as the
rifle<00:01:44.670> won't<00:01:44.850> function<00:01:45.060> properly<00:01:45.409> we<00:01:46.409> should

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
rifle won't function properly we should

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
rifle won't function properly we should
mention<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.820> aren't<00:01:48.119> comfortable

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
mention that if you aren't comfortable

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
mention that if you aren't comfortable
with<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.170> installation<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.759> not

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
with this installation or you're not
sure<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:52.200> best<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> qualified

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
sure it's best to take it to a qualified

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
sure it's best to take it to a qualified
gunsmith<00:01:53.970> who<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.329> install<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> parts<00:01:54.960> for

safety<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.640> would<00:02:24.390> recommend<00:02:24.659> tapping<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> up

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
safety I would recommend tapping it up

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.740 
safety I would recommend tapping it up
from<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.069> bottom<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.269> seems<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
from the bottom it just seems to be the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
from the bottom it just seems to be the
best<00:02:27.930> way<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.400> works<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.849> lot

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
best way to do it and it works a lot

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.789 
best way to do it and it works a lot
better<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> installation<00:02:31.079> of<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.409> ELSA

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
better for the installation of the ELSA

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.940 
better for the installation of the ELSA
to<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:36.480> may<00:02:36.629> also<00:02:36.780> need<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.079> brace<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.769> lower

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
to it may also need to brace the lower

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.949 
to it may also need to brace the lower
it's<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.579> tricky<00:02:38.849> just<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.720> get<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
it's a little tricky just to get the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.069 
it's a little tricky just to get the
camera<00:02:40.260> angle<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.269> see<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> pin<00:02:45.780> fell

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079

out get our punch out here just to give
you<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.799> quick<00:02:50.040> view<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.700> works<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
you a quick view of how this works you

you a quick view of how this works you
can<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.379> this<00:02:52.530> shift<00:02:52.859> here<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.519> what<00:02:53.879> it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
can see this shift here is what it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
can see this shift here is what it
mounts<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.049> there's<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.379> hole<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.799> the

let's take our Elsa safety lever drop it
on<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.959> shaft<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.790> put<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.000> same

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
on the shaft and put it in the same

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.619 
on the shaft and put it in the same
position<00:03:10.400> we're<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.579> take<00:03:11.730> our<00:03:11.790> fresh

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629

roll<00:03:12.930> pin<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:13.890> recommend<00:03:14.159> reusing<00:03:14.760> them

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
roll pin we don't recommend reusing them

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.569 
roll pin we don't recommend reusing them
as<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.329> squished<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.079> bit<00:03:16.230> and

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
as they get squished a little bit and

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.309 
as they get squished a little bit and
you<00:03:17.579> can<00:03:17.760> add<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> little<00:03:18.299> wiggle<00:03:18.660> into<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.169> just

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
you can add a little wiggle into it just

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.569 
you can add a little wiggle into it just
by<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> nature<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.370> sig<00:03:20.609> design

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
by the nature of the sig design

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.309 
by the nature of the sig design
sometimes<00:03:23.579> it's<00:03:23.760> easy<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.150> start<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.690> pin<00:03:25.049> in

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
sometimes it's easy to start this pin in

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.420 
sometimes it's easy to start this pin in
the<00:03:26.160> safety<00:03:26.519> before<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.849> get<00:03:27.030> going<00:03:28.250> or<00:03:29.250> you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the safety before you get going or you

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.449 
the safety before you get going or you
might<00:03:29.579> be<00:03:29.760> able<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:30.060> wiggle<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.930> bit

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
might be able to wiggle it in just a bit

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.680 
might be able to wiggle it in just a bit
let's<00:03:32.459> see<00:03:32.579> if<00:03:32.669> we<00:03:32.760> can<00:03:32.849> get<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.450> here

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
let's see if we can get this going here

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:50.950 
let's see if we can get this going here
by<00:03:34.379> hand<00:03:38.930> oops

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.450 

naturally<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:51.980> can<00:03:52.100> do<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.370> hundred

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
naturally you can do this a hundred

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.240 
naturally you can do this a hundred
times<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.450> it's<00:03:53.600> easy<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.200> then<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> moment

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
times and it's easy and then the moment

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.640 
times and it's easy and then the moment
you<00:03:55.340> gotta<00:03:55.490> film<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.930> find<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.320> pin<00:03:57.500> is

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
you gotta film it you find the pin is

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.400 
you gotta film it you find the pin is
magnetized<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:59.440> doesn't<00:04:00.440> want<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.710> go<00:04:02.410> there

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
magnetized and doesn't want to go there

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.830 
magnetized and doesn't want to go there
we<00:04:03.620> go<00:04:03.770> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.880> see<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.090> push<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.540> just<00:04:05.570> a

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
we go you can see I push it just a

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.180 
we go you can see I push it just a
little<00:04:05.870> bit<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:06.350> by<00:04:06.500> hand<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.040> got

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
little bit in there by hand and it got

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.610 
little bit in there by hand and it got
started<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.870> we'll<00:04:09.020> just<00:04:09.050> start<00:04:09.350> tapping<00:04:14.620> and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
started so we'll just start tapping and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.290 
started so we'll just start tapping and
the<00:04:15.920> pinhole<00:04:16.280> kind<00:04:16.550> of<00:04:16.640> self<00:04:16.880> line<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.210> the

the pinhole kind of self line to the
hole<00:04:17.480> if<00:04:17.900> you're<00:04:18.140> pretty<00:04:18.350> close<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.830> it<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:45.080> a

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
hole if you're pretty close to it it's a

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.960 
hole if you're pretty close to it it's a
lot<00:04:45.410> easier<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.890> do<00:04:46.040> if<00:04:46.160> you're<00:04:46.310> not<00:04:46.430> filming

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
lot easier to do if you're not filming

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.230 
lot easier to do if you're not filming
it<00:04:47.890> anyhow<00:04:48.890> there<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.580> safety<00:04:49.910> lever<00:04:50.060> is

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
it anyhow there the safety lever is

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.200 
it anyhow there the safety lever is
installed<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.530> what<00:04:51.620> we're<00:04:51.740> going<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:51.950> do<00:04:52.210> is

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
installed so what we're going to do is

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.490 
installed so what we're going to do is
check<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.630> make<00:04:53.750> sure<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.960> got<00:04:54.230> positive

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
check to make sure it's got positive

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.340 
check to make sure it's got positive
clicks<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.190> both<00:04:55.340> directions<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:57.050> can<00:04:57.080> hear

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
clicks in both directions you can hear

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.160 
clicks in both directions you can hear
the<00:04:57.470> click<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.920> the<00:04:58.820> cliq<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.870> noticed

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
the click and the cliq you noticed

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.070 
the click and the cliq you noticed
levers<00:05:00.530> on<00:05:00.710> safe<00:05:01.040> we'll<00:05:01.520> check<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.810> lever<00:05:02.960> on

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
levers on safe we'll check the lever on

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.350 
levers on safe we'll check the lever on
the<00:05:03.110> opposite<00:05:03.530> side<00:05:03.740> is<00:05:04.070> also<00:05:04.490> unsafe<00:05:05.000> and

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
the opposite side is also unsafe and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.930 
the opposite side is also unsafe and
they<00:05:05.660> move<00:05:05.870> together<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:07.340> everything<00:05:07.700> looks

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
they move together and everything looks

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.650 
they move together and everything looks
good<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.830> that's<00:05:09.830> installation<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.330> ELSA

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
good and that's installation of the ELSA

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.600 
good and that's installation of the ELSA
safety<00:05:11.960> lever<00:05:12.190> we're<00:05:13.190> going<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.340> do<00:05:13.460> around

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
safety lever we're going to do around

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.610 
safety lever we're going to do around
the<00:05:13.730> opposite<00:05:14.090> side<00:05:14.330> note<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.170> the<00:05:15.410> pin

the opposite side note that the pin

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.120 
the opposite side note that the pin
actually<00:05:16.010> goes<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:17.170> here<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.350> you'll<00:05:18.740> tap<00:05:18.980> it

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
actually goes in here and you'll tap it

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.070 
actually goes in here and you'll tap it
down<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:20.090> you're<00:05:20.210> installing<00:05:20.300> Elsa<00:05:20.930> we

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
down when you're installing Elsa we

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.750 
down when you're installing Elsa we
recommend<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.620> tap<00:05:21.860> through<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.280> round<00:05:22.490> side

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760

recommend you tap through the round side
don't<00:05:23.330> try<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.570> tap<00:05:23.840> through<00:05:24.020> here<00:05:24.260> it's<00:05:24.350> hard

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
don't try and tap through here it's hard

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.930 
don't try and tap through here it's hard
to<00:05:24.620> get<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.800> pin<00:05:24.980> started<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.520> may<00:05:25.640> ding<00:05:25.850> it

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
to get the pin started you may ding it

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.990 
to get the pin started you may ding it
up<00:05:26.060> a<00:05:26.150> little<00:05:26.300> bit<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:28.370> basically<00:05:28.760> it's<00:05:28.940> the

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
up a little bit but basically it's the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.030 
up a little bit but basically it's the
same<00:05:29.060> safety<00:05:29.510> lever<00:05:29.840> just<00:05:30.140> flipped<00:05:30.470> over<00:05:30.680> and

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
same safety lever just flipped over and

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.740 
same safety lever just flipped over and
it'll<00:05:31.400> mount<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.940> just<00:05:32.210> like<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.540> sig

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
it'll mount it's just like the sig

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.020 
it'll mount it's just like the sig
safety<00:05:33.170> lever<00:05:33.350> which<00:05:33.560> actually<00:05:33.820> when<00:05:34.820> we

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
safety lever which actually when we

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.020 
safety lever which actually when we
entered<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.450> way<00:05:35.720> is<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:37.040> exact<00:05:37.430> same<00:05:37.700> part

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
entered this way is the exact same part

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.380 
entered this way is the exact same part
on<00:05:38.210> both<00:05:38.420> sides<00:05:39.220> so<00:05:40.220> that's<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.550> ELSA<00:05:40.910> safety

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
on both sides so that's the ELSA safety

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.950 
on both sides so that's the ELSA safety
installation<00:05:42.140> and<00:05:42.320> thanks<00:05:42.530> for<00:05:42.650> watching
