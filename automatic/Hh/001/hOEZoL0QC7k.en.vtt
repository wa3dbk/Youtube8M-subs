00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 Minecraft servers, right? 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 you have left the team 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 but do not leave your link because I went 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.969
 hard x servers here for 1,816 is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 Difficult to find server for this new 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.110
 version but the version just came out I'm 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 here with them but nice tweetdeck 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 Thank you, this is 53 45 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 ipi will be in the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.250
 video description of all these 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.230
 rock servers and I decided to bring 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.110
 servers with enough mobility - this 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 here's 200 but that's ok I'm going to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 to enter here on the server to display 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.850
 each one to you remembering that I am 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.520
 100 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 optimus is then likely to give 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.350
 some leg 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.360
 here is the new schin that alex ne and me 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 I placed on the left in 3d 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 only it is not working on 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 servers for now but this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 server here is from mini-games most 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.979
 of the servers that brought you here is 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 nobody gave me cdp or survival for you 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 OK 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.790
 remembering that it is a disgrace 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.439
 here because of cin-mt fire there too 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.330
 it's 1.8 and mogadouro 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 but here is the first server is from 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.430
 No one for you, okay, and there's another one too. 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 here if I remember correctly, it's a mini game 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.259
 also this second remembering that the cpv 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.130
 step is nobody's me yes it's here has 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 pvp survival fripp wild wild which is the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.869
 creative is the one that blog star wars and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.869
 prison next take the music 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.290
 there was here are the servers 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.240
 remembering that everyone is working 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.330
 mini game is less some because neither the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.030
 version 1.8 barely left the kit crash but 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.800
 from here they have all the mini games and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.310
 normal things for you even the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.190
 survivor ooo free world skies blog all 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.710
 star wars and the prison ok here has a 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.170
 business to take players and speed on 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.040
 for us crack and that's what gives a fan 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.020
 two major centers 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.900
 sometimes here is a second server I will 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.430
 show after the third to give you and 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.190
 From here also some mini games and pv pp 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.080
 This is it, it's okay, right? 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.180
 these little faces marão 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.870
 but that 's okay so here he is warning 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.489
 whoa that we look at that it is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.080
 telling you a few things about the service 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.720
 It's a little light because you 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 is so connected but here it is also 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.400
 of mini-games pvp survival and other 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.170
 things and other stops 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.790
 So let's go to the room because it's 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.850
 cataloging a little and I hope you 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 really I hope to get the A1 opt Fainé 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.650
 Because the hospital is going to give a little help. 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.080
 this one from survival type survival 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.570
 This is completely here. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.549
 Survival and ce are little to achieve. 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.650
 a paper here is likely as I said and 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.590
 It's completely survivor, you'll come. 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.040
 here will build without plugins in anything 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.200
 Face can hit can kill here ok then 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.540
 You're going to run away and run away. 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.940
 to the woods to do your house and that's it 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.459
 man this is a list server 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.920
 of a character here has up to Alex 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.989
 here understood then this is a survival 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.430
 Synopsis staged because in time of time 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.459
 in when to do that there right? 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.660
 and that from here finally by the last is the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.489
 server 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.500
 I already logged on to the server, not actually. 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.570
 does not exist here is also from mini-games 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.200
 I think it 's the same one I entered. 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.630
 I think the same is to see is the same guy 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.760
 But no problem, it's going to be bone five. 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.989
 servers there it was ok 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.610
 What I liked the most was the first 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.519
 really it 's because nobody else says 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.709
 It's a lot more touch but it's not that 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.000
 This is something else but it is not 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.760
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.690
 be sure to evaluate the video that only 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.280
 its like your 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.930
 favorite in a commentary here two 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.930
 Thank you so much because if I did I went
