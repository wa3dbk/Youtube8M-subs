00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.540
 with a fork always so that you can 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.159
 mix and you can join everything from 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.950
 would then perfect and detail 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.159

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.640
 passion fruit juice can also be like 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 this orange and let's say that 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:38.790
 you think it's interesting maracuja look 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.790
 amazing and tamarind a shame madness 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.179
 so we're still here mixing this 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.039
 of course yes 3 cups of flour we put 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.110
 a teaspoon of half sugar 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:58.119
 teaspoon of salt and olive oil 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.039
 but also if you can put a 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.750
 mixer if we work has been in case 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.760
 people do not have that anymore 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.340
 instruments but if we are going to put a 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.280
 little bit more of that and since we do not have 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.940
 time to do it does everything that it 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.730
 does is mixed with the masses 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.830
 perfectly with the hands ok or the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.630
 hands knead pretty well going to happen 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 well here we have a mass look here 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.000
 well and what we do with it is that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.860
 after we put it against texture 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.680
 that already becomes a mass the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 We put a plastic sleeve or a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.980
 something napkin we take it to the fridge 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.400
 minimum half hour 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.890
 perfectly a plastic cover of 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.110
 save food and you can leave it until a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.940
 time and leave it a week 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.470
 first a very cold temperature can 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.470
 give up a month well 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.739
 exactly what you eat how easy 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.090
 would like to do this 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.489
 I wish we had 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.860
 a little bit of this here simply 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.330
 putting a little bit of flour and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.580
 what we do is natalia look very 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.739
 simple let's go if you do it and it's going 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.760
 going around until you achieve this that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.030
 is here look at it here well how does it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.030
 [Music] 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.740
 it's simple 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.020
 [Music] 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.150
 so you're ready to put that 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.150
 look we just saw the thickness 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.280
 perfect you can also put that 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.180
 a little detail there 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.870
 we say pastelito to this for 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.740
 the shapes that are redondito have two 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.770

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.930
 [Music] 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.780
 we can do it like you and it's going to be like that 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.410
 for nothing like only two Argentines and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.070
 simply a detail you have to put a 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.730
 little water on the banks so that 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.730
 can hit well 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.020
