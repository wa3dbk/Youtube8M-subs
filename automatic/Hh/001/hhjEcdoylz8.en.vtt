and then the damage kappa laid waste to
50<00:00:43.200> mil<00:00:44.719> but<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.289> i<00:00:46.320> am<00:00:46.440> doing<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.430> few

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
50 mil but here i am doing just a few

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.189 
50 mil but here i am doing just a few
boss<00:00:47.910> runs<00:00:48.239> before<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.260> patch<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:51.170> yeah<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
boss runs before that patch and yeah I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
boss runs before that patch and yeah I
