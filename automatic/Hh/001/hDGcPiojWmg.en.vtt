00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
adapter and I'm hoping is gonna work

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.540

because<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.300> made<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> mistake<00:00:49.530> before<00:00:52.550> just

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
because I made a mistake before just

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
because I made a mistake before just
plugging<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:55.129> normal<00:00:56.129> Saturday<00:00:58.100> night<00:00:59.100> down

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
plugging a normal Saturday night down

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099 
plugging a normal Saturday night down
into<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.059> before<00:01:00.420> which<00:01:00.930> isn't

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
into one of these before which isn't

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.810 
into one of these before which isn't
another<00:01:02.070> another<00:01:02.609> 80<00:01:02.969> gig<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:04.769> play<00:01:04.799> fire<00:01:05.250> how

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
another another 80 gig to play fire how

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.590 
another another 80 gig to play fire how
and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.260> filed<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:12.150> only<00:01:12.270> needs

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and I think I filed it so it only needs

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.859 
and I think I filed it so it only needs
5<00:01:12.869> volts<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.729> what<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> blade<00:01:15.150> cable

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
5 volts which is what the blade cable

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.550 
5 volts which is what the blade cable
delivers<00:01:16.729> these<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.090> grams<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:21.320> be<00:01:22.320> gone

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
delivers these are just grams so be gone

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.179 
delivers these are just grams so be gone
with<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> 12<00:01:23.250> volt<00:01:23.900> right<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:25.110> gonna<00:01:25.320> monk

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
with the 12 volt right I'm gonna monk

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.380 
with the 12 volt right I'm gonna monk
this<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:28.020> machine<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> year<00:01:29.390> and
