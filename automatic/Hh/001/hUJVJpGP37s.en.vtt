invasive<00:02:09.869> surgery<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.710> cancer

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
invasive surgery for the cancer

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.950 
invasive surgery for the cancer
procedures<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.630> really<00:02:12.810> exciting

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
procedures which is really exciting

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.800 
procedures which is really exciting
because<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.830> really<00:02:14.370> reduces<00:02:14.810> recovery

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
because that really reduces recovery

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.559 
because that really reduces recovery
time<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:17.280> otherwise<00:02:17.520> they<00:02:17.910> come<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.360> of

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
time but otherwise they come because of

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.200 
time but otherwise they come because of
the<00:02:19.140> cancer<00:02:19.530> center<00:02:19.950> sometimes<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.030> come

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
the cancer center sometimes they come

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.940 
the cancer center sometimes they come
because<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> research<00:02:22.140> opportunities

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
because of the research opportunities

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.680 
because of the research opportunities
get<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> lot<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> patience<00:02:24.210> for<00:02:24.390> second

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
get a lot of patience for second

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.430 
get a lot of patience for second
opinions<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.880> offer<00:02:27.060> hope<00:02:27.900> sometimes

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
opinions and we can offer hope sometimes

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.059 
opinions and we can offer hope sometimes
through<00:02:28.770> our

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
through our

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.940 
through our
monocle<00:02:29.340> trials<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.499> you<00:02:34.799> know<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
monocle trials I think that you know a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.039 
monocle trials I think that you know a
doctor-patient<00:02:35.609> relationship<00:02:36.359> is<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.599> team

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
doctor-patient relationship is a team

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.379 
doctor-patient relationship is a team
and<00:02:37.379> we<00:02:38.129> both<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.609> be<00:02:38.639> on<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.939> same<00:02:39.150> side

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
and we both have to be on the same side

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.670 
and we both have to be on the same side
and<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.689> it's<00:02:39.840> really<00:02:39.989> important<00:02:40.439> to<00:02:40.499> actually

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and so it's really important to actually

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.979 
and so it's really important to actually
