the normal water supply in some

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
the normal water supply in some

communities and in those communities

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.389 
communities and in those communities
they<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> lower<00:00:48.629> suicide<00:00:49.410> rate<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
they have a lower suicide rate and so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
they have a lower suicide rate and so
they're<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.760> investigating<00:00:51.750> whether

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
they're really investigating whether

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.709 
they're really investigating whether
trace<00:00:52.410> amounts<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.920> lithium<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.030> change

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
trace amounts of lithium can just change

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.590 
trace amounts of lithium can just change
the<00:00:55.140> mood<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.070> community<00:00:56.489> enough<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.390> really

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the mood in a community enough to really

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
the mood in a community enough to really
in<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.230> positive<00:00:58.410> way<00:00:58.680> without<00:00:58.949> having<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> bad

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
interesting concept you know it's the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
interesting concept you know it's the
same<00:01:05.129> reason<00:01:05.430> why<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.729> put<00:01:06.000> iodine<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.170> salt

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409

so<00:01:45.329> after<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.020> can't<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.560> anymore<00:01:46.740> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so after you can't see it anymore it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
so after you can't see it anymore it
doesn't<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.430> disappear<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.180> residue

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
doesn't just disappear the residue

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.260 
doesn't just disappear the residue
settles<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.770> settles<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.430> carpets

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
settles and it settles in carpets

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.139 
settles and it settles in carpets
furniture<00:01:51.630> car<00:01:52.560> upholstery<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.640> their

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
furniture car upholstery and their

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
furniture car upholstery and their
studies<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.720> show<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> particularly<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
studies that show that particularly in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.760 
studies that show that particularly in
children<00:01:55.890> third<00:01:56.759> hand<00:01:57.090> smoke<00:01:57.290> residue<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.619> be

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
children third hand smoke residue can be

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.600 
children third hand smoke residue can be
as<00:01:58.950> dangerous<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.700> secondhand<00:02:00.600> smoke<00:02:01.049> because

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
as dangerous as secondhand smoke because

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.280 
as dangerous as secondhand smoke because
children's<00:02:02.610> Airways<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.600> much<00:02:03.840> smaller

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
children's Airways are so much smaller

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.910 
children's Airways are so much smaller
and<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.250> residue<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> toxic<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.200> one

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and the residue can be toxic so one

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.589 
and the residue can be toxic so one
thing<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.129> parents<00:02:08.399> may<00:02:08.819> want<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> really

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
thing that parents may want to really

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.809 
thing that parents may want to really
think<00:02:09.840> about<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.590> allowing

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
think about is not allowing

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.789 
think about is not allowing
is<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.060> smoke<00:02:12.359> in<00:02:12.629> their<00:02:12.840> home<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.409> their<00:02:13.439> car

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
is to smoke in their home or their car

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.160 
is to smoke in their home or their car
even<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.090> absence<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.689> their<00:02:15.959> children

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
even in the absence of their children

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.349 
even in the absence of their children
because<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> residue<00:02:17.189> is<00:02:17.340> left<00:02:17.579> over<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.060> it

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
because the residue is left over and it

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.789 
because the residue is left over and it
could<00:02:18.480> be<00:02:18.510> harmful<00:02:18.840> particularly<00:02:19.409> as<00:02:19.560> kids

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
could be harmful particularly as kids

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.080 
could be harmful particularly as kids

stress disorder and this is by playing
the<00:02:30.060> video<00:02:30.239> game<00:02:30.599> tetris<00:02:31.639> so<00:02:32.639> really<00:02:33.569> cool

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
the video game tetris so really cool

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.459 
the video game tetris so really cool
this<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.189> one<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.340> those<00:02:35.459> cool<00:02:35.760> things

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
this is one of those cool things

this is one of those cool things
post-traumatic<00:02:37.469> stress<00:02:37.919> disorder<00:02:38.129> one<00:02:38.489> of

post-traumatic stress disorder one of

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.369 
post-traumatic stress disorder one of
the<00:02:38.639> biggest<00:02:38.879> issues<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.659> it<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
the biggest issues with it are the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.619 
the biggest issues with it are the
visual<00:02:40.919> images<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.760> flashbacks<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
visual images and the flashbacks that

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.140 
visual images and the flashbacks that
come<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.109> after<00:02:43.590> someone<00:02:43.980> experiences<00:02:44.909> or

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
come back after someone experiences or

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.659 
come back after someone experiences or
sees<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> horrific<00:02:46.109> event<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.519> these

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
sees a horrific event so what these

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.780 
sees a horrific event so what these
researchers<00:02:48.230> showed<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.769> in<00:02:50.189> people<00:02:50.579> who

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
researchers showed is that in people who

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.659 
researchers showed is that in people who
are<00:02:50.819> exposed<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.620> gruesome<00:02:52.919> event<00:02:53.519> if

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
are exposed to just a gruesome event if

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.229 
are exposed to just a gruesome event if
they<00:02:54.269> play<00:02:54.659> tetris<00:02:55.349> afterwards<00:02:56.189> they<00:02:56.969> have

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
they play tetris afterwards they have

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.689 
they play tetris afterwards they have
fewer<00:02:57.750> flashbacks<00:02:58.560> than<00:02:59.040> individuals<00:02:59.579> who

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
fewer flashbacks than individuals who

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.789 
fewer flashbacks than individuals who
are<00:02:59.730> exposed<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.480> same<00:03:00.689> event<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.260> don't

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
are exposed to the same event and don't

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.909 
are exposed to the same event and don't
play<00:03:01.980> tetris<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.549> here's<00:03:02.879> why<00:03:03.469> the<00:03:04.469> there's<00:03:04.859> a

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
play tetris and here's why the there's a

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.459 
play tetris and here's why the there's a
part<00:03:05.189> of<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> brain<00:03:05.639> that<00:03:06.000> embeds<00:03:06.750> visual

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
part of the brain that embeds visual

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.170 
part of the brain that embeds visual
images<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.370> when<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.639> see<00:03:08.879> something

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
images and so when you see something

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.119 
images and so when you see something
terrible<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.989> gets<00:03:10.379> embedded<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.919> brain

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
terrible it gets embedded in the brain

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.569 
terrible it gets embedded in the brain
tetris<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.269> those<00:03:12.419> falling<00:03:12.930> bricks

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
tetris and those falling bricks

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.129 
tetris and those falling bricks
preoccupies<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.879> brain<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:15.719> the

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
preoccupies the brain so that the

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.259 
preoccupies the brain so that the
horrific<00:03:16.530> visual<00:03:17.220> image<00:03:17.519> doesn't<00:03:17.909> get

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
horrific visual image doesn't get

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.509 
horrific visual image doesn't get
embedded<00:03:18.659> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.049> brain<00:03:19.259> and<00:03:19.439> so<00:03:19.919> they<00:03:20.099> even

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
embedded in the brain and so they even

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.530 
embedded in the brain and so they even
when<00:03:20.879> they<00:03:21.030> did<00:03:21.419> recall<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.229> the<00:03:23.150> bad<00:03:24.150> event

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
when they did recall of the bad event

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.569 
when they did recall of the bad event
afterwards<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.349> people<00:03:25.590> who<00:03:25.709> paid<00:03:25.919> played

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
afterwards and people who paid played

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.729 
afterwards and people who paid played
Tetris<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.449> didn't<00:03:27.780> remember<00:03:28.049> as<00:03:28.349> much<00:03:28.379> they

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
Tetris they didn't remember as much they

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.499 
Tetris they didn't remember as much they
weren't<00:03:28.979> having<00:03:29.129> flashbacks<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:30.090> even<00:03:30.389> when

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:30.509 
weren't having flashbacks but even when

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.210 
weren't having flashbacks but even when
they<00:03:30.659> kept<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.019> journal<00:03:31.049> for<00:03:31.560> about<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:31.979> week

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
they kept a journal for about a week

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.969 
they kept a journal for about a week
later<00:03:32.280> they<00:03:33.090> had<00:03:33.120> forty-three<00:03:34.109> percent<00:03:34.379> fewer

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
later they had forty-three percent fewer

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.099 
later they had forty-three percent fewer
flashbacks<00:03:35.669> and<00:03:35.879> people<00:03:36.150> who<00:03:36.239> didn't<00:03:36.479> play<00:03:36.569> so

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
flashbacks and people who didn't play so

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.149 
flashbacks and people who didn't play so
it<00:03:37.379> just<00:03:37.409> keeps<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.129> brain<00:03:38.280> from<00:03:38.609> encoding

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
it just keeps the brain from encoding

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.929 
it just keeps the brain from encoding
something<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.310> wasn't<00:03:41.489> very<00:03:41.639> pleasant

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
something that wasn't very pleasant
