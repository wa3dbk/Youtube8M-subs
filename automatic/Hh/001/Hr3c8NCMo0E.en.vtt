00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.520
 good day to all channel subscribers 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.980
 lamp review but finally i'm back 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.280
 language and brought with him the long-awaited 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.009
 rack matter what is the pressure one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.490
 slight disappointment i'm on my own 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.740
 stupidity learned all the kids in the kit 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.789
 the floor is actually quite amazing 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 that idea sells many racks from 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.140
 canvases do business time none 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 quite convenient that people can buy 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.500
 various types of shelves and glass can 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.129
 choose ordinary here is darkening to sell 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 rack free state to sell 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.809
 chairs without chair sheets of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 countertops and the most important thing is that they are not 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.370
 where you have not written any online no 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.600
 not a different configuration there is no mole 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.690
 it was written anywhere in the store 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.559
 absolutely inscriptions that come with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.170
 shelving no floor well I do not hesitate 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.119
 I bought a Sivash 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.399
 checked all the equipment actually 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.979
 u hid the same store and looked with 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:23.880
 the corner here are these things 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.330
 leaned out for 200 hand confused them with 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.410
 the regiment so don't think killed went 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.550
 on that again you want a lot and therefore 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:39.300
 I didnâ€™t particularly like to rush him 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.200
 even as it pleased, and then he 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.000
 turned out quite compact difficult 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.360
 insofar as 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.940
 I delivered the dimensions there was 128 to me 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.479
 it seemed like quite a lot 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:01.340
 embed in general wall such a car here 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:06.110
 interesting design solutions where are they 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 the wall was laid out and compact 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:15.790
 this is such a big box 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.770
 Now we will analyze this whole thing and try 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.780
 to collect 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.580
 so what do you think will not really 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.810
 interesting reception directly in 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.520
 the moment I pulled it all out of 2 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.360
 as well as for the thought rack 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.640
 quite simply does not consist of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.690
 some huge amount of detail 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.910
 their principles 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.580
 easily collected at home 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.390
 conditions are shifted included 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.390
 instructions 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.940
 the medicine 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:59.129
 for assembly 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:02.129
 various screws for screws and legs 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.129
 android 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.990
 we have in place 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.890
 behind 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:38.790
 cogs legs yes right here 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.790
 specified amount 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:53.170
 here and yes most likely will be 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:55.320
 key whether ruble should be moving 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.320
 a little bit 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:06.170
 necessarily very important to ensure 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:06.170
 assembly that everything is present 2 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.590
 12 joke correctly 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.110
 four 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.620
 hike 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.330
 no complaints about the idea not only was 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:53.500
 they always spread 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.930
 so 2 water all right all 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:03.350
 present as if eternal so 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:06.410
 let's build now i think look 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.860
 all this nonsense i will be showing you 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:15.280
 stage commenting on what I actually 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.910
 I do the principle for the whole assembly and what 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.910
 So 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.339
 let's 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:31.669
 the first step according to the instructions 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.379
 twisting these bolts here are the top 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.379
 the cover of our rack 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.379
 zone can boring 6 pieces so let's go 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.570
 the next step is to install the side 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.550
 walls note that 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.340
 guides to the back wall on 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.280
 top cover on the side necessarily 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.270
 You must be in the same direction Well 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.270
 let's get started 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.120
 be sure to fix the side walls 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.950
 squeezing bolts now insert 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.120
 central partition again 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.650
 pay attention to the grooves of the guides 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.340
 the central partition is also needed 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.050
 fasten 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.540
 sinking bolts next step 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.190
 will be setting deposits for not walls 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.190
 fold insert 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:51.249
 now similar to the top cover 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:52.509
 fix the bottom but that is not installed 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:56.649
 business is left for small 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:59.319
 fasten the legs so well here we are 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:01.449
 finished the assembly process was not very 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.339
 hard and I'm generally pleased with the result 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.139
 very sorry of course that with the shelves so 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.919
 It turned out but this question is most likely 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.360
 I will regulate after the new year 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.279
 the next video we will start 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.969
 directly improving this 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.729
 shelving 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.429
 we will try to strive for the result 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.989
 which we set ourselves 

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:21.669
 thank you so much for watching again 

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:23.619
 Happy New Year, everyone 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.919
 stay on my channel to ambulances 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.919
 meeting
