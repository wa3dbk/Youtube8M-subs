00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
them this just seems to take a really

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.260 
them this just seems to take a really
long<00:03:04.050> time<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> set<00:03:05.280> up<00:03:05.400> initially<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:06.090> once

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
long time to set up initially but once

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.940 
long time to set up initially but once
it's<00:03:06.450> set<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.690> after<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.770> pretty

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
it's set up after that it's it's pretty

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.880 
it's set up after that it's it's pretty
fast<00:03:08.340> overall<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.570> that's<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.170> initial

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
fast overall but that's just the initial

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.980 
fast overall but that's just the initial
set<00:03:11.100> up<00:03:11.250> seems<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.700> take<00:03:11.910> quite<00:03:12.180> some<00:03:12.480> time<00:03:12.750> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
set up seems to take quite some time and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:26.550 
set up seems to take quite some time and
is<00:03:13.140> fairly<00:03:13.560> involved
