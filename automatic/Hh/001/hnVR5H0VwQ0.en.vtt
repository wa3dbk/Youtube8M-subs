00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
because it's hutch cleaning day I

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.160 
because it's hutch cleaning day I
thought<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.389> would<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.689> good<00:00:03.840> opportunity

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
thought this would be a good opportunity

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.259 
thought this would be a good opportunity
to<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:05.600> show<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.990> guinea<00:00:07.350> pig<00:00:07.529> touches

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
to and show you the guinea pig touches

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.570 
to and show you the guinea pig touches

spider bye
so<00:00:33.030> we'll<00:00:33.149> start<00:00:33.360> during<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> bottom<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.969> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
so we'll start during the bottom and the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
so we'll start during the bottom and the
hutch<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.480> about<00:00:38.120> four<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.329> half<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.660> five

foot by two and a half feet and width
and<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.530> nothing<00:00:46.649> terribly<00:00:47.070> exciting

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and so there's nothing terribly exciting

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
and so there's nothing terribly exciting
as<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:47.969> destroyed<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.539> box

think<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> guinea<00:01:13.350> pigs<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> hut

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
think you know guinea pigs like a hut

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
think you know guinea pigs like a hut
they'd<00:01:14.310> much<00:01:14.520> rather<00:01:14.580> lie<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.210> something

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
they'd much rather lie with something

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.590 
they'd much rather lie with something
over<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.170> than<00:01:16.860> something<00:01:17.130> under<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
over them than something under them and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
over them than something under them and
the<00:01:18.780> reason<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:19.200> using<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.890> dog<00:01:20.159> bed<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the reason I'm using the dog bed is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
the reason I'm using the dog bed is
because<00:01:21.000> pickle<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> Cal<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.770> really

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because pickle and Cal are really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
because pickle and Cal are really
disgusting<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> lot<00:01:24.630> easier<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
disgusting and it's a lot easier to just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
disgusting and it's a lot easier to just
take<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> dog<00:01:25.890> bed<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.540> chalk

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
out everything that's in it every day or
so<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.180> way<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> rest<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> hutch

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so and that way the rest of the hutch

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.179 
so and that way the rest of the hutch
wait<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.140> though<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> do

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
wait you know I do think though I do

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.130 
wait you know I do think though I do
plate<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> rest<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> hutch

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
plate and then the rest of the hutch

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
plate and then the rest of the hutch
stays<00:01:37.350> quite<00:01:37.560> clean<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> little

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
stays quite clean and they have a little

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
stays quite clean and they have a little
bit<00:01:38.729> more<00:01:38.880> space<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> flee<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> can

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
bit more space to flee and so you can

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
bit more space to flee and so you can
see<00:01:40.860> they've<00:01:41.009> still<00:01:41.189> got<00:01:41.280> their<00:01:41.400> edible<00:01:41.670> log<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
see they've still got their edible log I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.399 
see they've still got their edible log I
just<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.630> understand<00:01:42.899> why<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.079> looks<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
just don't understand why it looks so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
just don't understand why it looks so
disgusting<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:44.040> camera<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
disgusting on camera I think it's just

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880 
disgusting on camera I think it's just
all<00:01:45.030> their<00:01:45.210> teeth<00:01:45.390> mark<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.829> think

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
all their teeth mark on it and I think

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
all their teeth mark on it and I think
mostly<00:01:47.280> Cal's<00:01:47.610> done<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> chewing<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
mostly Cal's done the chewing of this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
mostly Cal's done the chewing of this
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.140> they've<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.680> tunnel<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> used

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and then they've got a tunnel that used

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
and then they've got a tunnel that used
to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> grass<00:01:50.670> tunnel<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:53.240> I'm

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to be a grass tunnel up the back and I'm

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.899 
to be a grass tunnel up the back and I'm
again<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.710> double<00:01:56.250> food<00:01:56.460> ball<00:01:56.729> if

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
again I use the double food ball if

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
again I use the double food ball if
you've<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.240> boars<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.869> recommend<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you've got boars I recommend if you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
you've got boars I recommend if you
don't<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.460> food<00:01:59.729> balls<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.930> in

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
don't have to food balls you know in

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.620 
don't have to food balls you know in
opposite<00:02:01.619> ends<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.880> double<00:02:03.270> food<00:02:03.450> ball

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
opposite ends to get a double food ball

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
opposite ends to get a double food ball
and<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.170> saves<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> lot<00:02:04.710> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and it actually saves in a lot of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.289 
and it actually saves in a lot of
arguing<00:02:05.159> there<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> arguing

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
arguing there can be a lot of arguing

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.869 
arguing there can be a lot of arguing
over<00:02:06.930> whose<00:02:07.710> head<00:02:07.950> sits<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> food<00:02:08.759> bowl

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
over whose head sits in the food bowl

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.470 
over whose head sits in the food bowl
you<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.450> these<00:02:09.599> two<00:02:09.840> Oh<00:02:10.160> No<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:12.300> are<00:02:12.390> you

doing
to<00:02:14.070> niggle<00:02:14.400> each<00:02:14.520> other<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.240> one

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
to niggle each other all the time one

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
see there that M cows in charge but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.410 
see there that M cows in charge but
don't<00:02:21.030> worry<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.440> humping<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
don't worry that and kind of humping and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.400 
don't worry that and kind of humping and
rumbling<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.690> all<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.140> normal

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
rumbling and all that it's just normal

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.660 
rumbling and all that it's just normal
behaviour<00:02:25.920> they're<00:02:26.070> not<00:02:26.220> fighting<00:02:26.460> they're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
behaviour they're not fighting they're

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.730 
behaviour they're not fighting they're
just<00:02:27.060> arguing<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:27.900> dominance<00:02:28.380> which<00:02:28.560> these

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
just arguing for dominance which these

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.440 
just arguing for dominance which these
two<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.480> time<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.790> think<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.300> should

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
two do all the time so I think we should

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.700 
two do all the time so I think we should
just<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> hutch<00:02:34.200> instead<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> me

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
just go in the hutch instead of me

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.910 
just go in the hutch instead of me
opening<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> other<00:02:35.190> door<00:02:35.430> yeah<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> there's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
opening the other door yeah so there's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
opening the other door yeah so there's
the<00:02:38.010> water<00:02:38.220> bottle<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:38.850> obviously<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:40.080> on

the water bottle there obviously it's on

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.010 
the water bottle there obviously it's on
the<00:02:40.320> outside<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.600> which<00:02:42.600> gets<00:02:42.810> filled

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the outside here and which gets filled

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.180

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
basically all that's going on down here

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.160 
basically all that's going on down here
and<00:03:04.490> my<00:03:05.490> pigs<00:03:06.060> aren't<00:03:06.330> big<00:03:06.480> toy<00:03:06.720> players
