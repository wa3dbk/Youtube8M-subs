00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.390
 open up 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.860
 and then rises higher 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.490
 and plan 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.910

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.420
 picture 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 what is it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.090

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.090
 a bit of resource deletion in this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760
 parts and lo and behold 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 best as far as lop-ear sheksna 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.260
 our 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.590
 although fatherland 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.940
 percent 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 Further 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 night bird except 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.360
 I have such rights 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.600
 in this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 and move on 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.930
 but the whole system is just because I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600
 we love all these genes 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.050
 future 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 but can draw 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150

 like this and a side salad setting 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.280

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.029
 the base begins 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.539
 we made such a key to it 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.259
