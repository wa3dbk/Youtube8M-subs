00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.690
 we went to how to elaborate them first 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.020
 that we should fill our glass of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.240
 with eyes 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.509

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.659
 an exact measurement of the three fields 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.659
 they speak we squeeze half a lemon 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.970
 and we are going to open our 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.970
 tonic water and let's do 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.610
 with a lot of foam 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.110
 and we are going to take 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.110
 a slice of lemon 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.000
 with a knife 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.670
 and we are going to achieve our glass 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.900
 with lemon then you can add a 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.620
 little salt in case the case comes out very bitter 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.280
