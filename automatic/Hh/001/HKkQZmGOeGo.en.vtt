these two plastic pieces and the way

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.090 
these two plastic pieces and the way
back<00:04:20.090> is<00:04:20.359> nicely<00:04:20.780> detailed<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.830> did<00:04:24.830> this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
back is nicely detailed and did this

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.050 
back is nicely detailed and did this
part<00:04:25.460> where<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.850> put<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.740> beams<00:04:28.040> dagger<00:04:28.940> and

part where you put the beams dagger and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.450 
part where you put the beams dagger and
uh<00:04:29.620> being<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:31.010> sabre<00:04:32.650> could<00:04:33.650> go<00:04:33.890> up<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.220> down

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
uh being a sabre could go up and down

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.800 
uh being a sabre could go up and down
like<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.860> um<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.310> tried<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.560> have<00:04:39.560> DX<00:04:39.979> Yoho<00:04:40.810> GN

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
like that um I tried to have DX Yoho GN

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.969 
like that um I tried to have DX Yoho GN
beam<00:04:42.229> sword

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
beam sword

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.320 
beam sword
I<00:04:43.010> mean<00:04:43.370> GN<00:04:43.760> sword<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.740> thought<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:47.030> this

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
I mean GN sword I thought that this

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.250 
I mean GN sword I thought that this
little<00:04:47.870> handle<00:04:48.470> could<00:04:49.370> move<00:04:50.020> because<00:04:51.020> there's

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
little handle could move because there's

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.130 
little handle could move because there's
like<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> joint<00:04:51.890> but<00:04:52.460> as<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:53.060> was<00:04:53.270> moving<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.930> I

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
like a joint but as I was moving it I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.610 
like a joint but as I was moving it I
noticed<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:56.120> plastic<00:04:56.660> was<00:04:56.840> warping<00:04:57.440> and

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
noticed that the plastic was warping and

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.920 
noticed that the plastic was warping and
I<00:04:57.680> was<00:04:57.830> gonna<00:04:58.010> break<00:04:58.340> it<00:04:58.610> lucky<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.150> noticed<00:04:59.660> in

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
I was gonna break it lucky I noticed in

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
little peg that's on this and GN blades

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:14.920 
little peg that's on this and GN blades
fit<00:06:04.470> into<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:05.070> hand<00:06:05.370> like<00:06:06.000> so<00:06:12.890> the<00:06:13.890> GN<00:06:14.430> sword

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
fit into the hand like so the GN sword

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.570 
fit into the hand like so the GN sword
the<00:06:15.930> one<00:06:16.110> cool<00:06:16.380> thing<00:06:16.440> is<00:06:16.830> that<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.220> shield
