00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.669
 jaime mendieta of 29 years old from san 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.380
 carazo frames started two years ago the 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.049
 production and marketing business 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.269
 of cooked beans but managed 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.740
 be crowned as systems engineer to 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.200
 the pair of his wife by profession 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 architect chose to dedicate herself to this 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.670
 business because he saw in it a 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 opportunity to look improvement 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.680
 first it was an idea that I 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.630
 it arose because it looked at the need for 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.119
 there are people who cook beans but 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.150
 really did not know with what hygiene what 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.940
 he does it then I got the idea and 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.030
 a project that will take my 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.640
 heart and my love together with my wife and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.680
 we come to form the product that is 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.940
 called bean beans that are beans 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.420
 cooked and as goals we have to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 cover the entire national market and therefore 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.910
 and why not later on be able to export 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.220
 mendieta processed per day from 3 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.700
 the early morning two quintals of beans 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.500
 the equivalent of 30 quintals per month 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 after cleaning sewing and package 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.020
 product initiates the process of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.609
 distribution 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.859
 from grocery stores and chains 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.219
 supermarkets of the capital good this 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:19.179
 is the product is first put on 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:22.539
 choose the bean then wash the ledo 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.520
 put in the baton we put a 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.799
 quintal 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.280
 we give two daily things a quintal per 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:34.179
 cooked then processed is proceeded to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 pack it and then it is packaged in 12 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.490
 units and then to cooling for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.510
 later the next day leave to 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.310
 distribute it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.770
 and you get involved with your wife with your 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.510
 family and look like I'm the one who 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.140
 then distributed my wife that to 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.560
 charge of what is the all that is the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.930
 pack everything that is hygiene and everything 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.630
 Local is the one that takes care of everything 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.580
 that the young entrepreneur says that with 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 Your product is guaranteed savings 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 time and money 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.820
 look really I give you a pound and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.570
 four ounces 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.390
 now the bean is at 15 the pound 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.650
 As I say, it's unstable and I'll tell you 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.800
 I offer cooked 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.640
 under hygiene just so you put it to 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.879
 fry and it is not the same as worth a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
 pound at less cost and for refrigerated it 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.410
 only one that has to be maintained 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.840
 Refrigerated is the only thing and that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.970
 it turns out because there really are times 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.099
 have you run out of beans and you do not go 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.140
 to put to cook at that time while 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.349
 mine already comes only to throw it to the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.660
 paila and make him send them or buy it 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.680
 must clean them or put to cook what 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.690
 to be aware of nothing simply is already 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 made the quality that guaranteed in the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.769
 product is reflected in the posts 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.140
 of more demanding distribution as the 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.400
 supermarket chain walmart where 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.890
 There is a support program for 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.349
 small and medium producers in the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.470
 program we have about 60 small and 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.000
 medium-sized companies that are 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.160
 benefiting from this program they receive 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.470
 technical training receive courses 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.489
 about administration in general many 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.709
 times the problem that these companies 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.480
 small and medium enterprises have 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.950
 that do not keep an accounting in 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.810
 some cases they do not know if 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.380
 they are really winning they are losing 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.050
 and then 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.420
 this training either whether 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.800
 really win or not there for example me 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.560
 agreement yesterday I was meeting with some 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.190
 SMEs that told me that the product that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.520
 I was not selling they sold it in a few 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.040
 454 gram bags 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.560
 and really they do not realize 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.890
 if they win or lose and they had the same 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.600
 price of other similar products 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 competence of them but they are born 400 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.000
 grams also decreased the amount in 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.680
 packing of 400 grams and now they are given 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.980
 realize that they really are winning and 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.690
 with 454 grams were losing and the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 This young man's goal and their families are 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.460
 substantial, it is hoped to conquer the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.560
 domestic market with your product does not 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.010
 discarding that a frijolitos future 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 cross the borders of nicaragua 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.060
 take over be the entire national market 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.690
 think about distributing it in everything that is 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.940
 national the west in the north and all 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.940
 the capital all departments
