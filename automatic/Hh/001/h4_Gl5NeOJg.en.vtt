 I really thank the 55th United 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 so we close this parenthesis delete 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.820
 to I'm going to actually explain to you 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.260
 how to use windows movie maker 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.270
 throw the most mounting of espi 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 on windows movie maker 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.840
 it's a bit the same it's a bit like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.140
 sony vegas it's easier than sony 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.469
 vegas 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.969
 but it's about six months chance results 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.670
 are not as good as sony villiers 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.760
 promised it's really good 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 shout are programs if I take 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:09.540
 my logo is this one well I can put 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:12.320
 of music watch this but the one 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.320
 there for example look 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 for now it's very healthy look 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 if you want to make a slideshow or a 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.280
 candy hostages you take our video or 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 I want to put my background 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.400
 well you can have a lot 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:46.369
 young team transition hurts with 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.369
 that of the minimal 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.380
 so it's really very simple 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.020
 of use 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.720
 I'm going to show you how to make one to 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.210
 spidah so here it's with them that with the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.680
 ddd pictures but it is exactly one 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.720
 can do the same thing with does a 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.690
 video 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.950
 in the photos we make his bed slideshow 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.070
 want to change the speed so 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.070
 watch i'm going to do new projects 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:27.500
 I am me if I find myself I am seeing 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:35.330
 if I find a view so a video 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.740
 I have to see that this is a very trivial 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.150
 video I never have blood on 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.110
 youtube it was demand in china chen 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.700
 have watched speed we that's it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.740
 really very very fast so it's 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.580
 however when the text 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.940
 uh excuse me you put a video 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.290
 it was still quite long 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:06.320
 take for example the 2 x 2 and how 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.660
 it goes very very fast and we are four 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.830
 only two times 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.730
 and especially videos you can also 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.350
 add music like everything to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.350
 the hour hop 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.350
 look 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:31.130
 she your music stays the speed at the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.130
 nudity stands that's fine 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.740
 then we'll do how to put a 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.010
 text at the beginning of the video or finally a 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.590
 video of the holidays to go in 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.880
 the welcome lot there are people 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.870
 generic for at first it happens in 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.030
 melted in everything she is for example 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.850
 atomics you want some like 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:06.180
 that where our failures behind that but it's 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:07.200
 a gameplay video on w3 small to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.510
 that time I was not well 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:16.769
 complicated hop have changed the font even 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:22.010
 you can change the color here from 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.010
 change the color of the background here 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.320
 here and see how it feels a little 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.980
 a background of the text slowly appears cm 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.980
 in title makes 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.200
 after there is the video that puts directly 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:49.050
 pretty much if you want a little trick 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.450
 in meadows the title you can very 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.020
 well do that once in mid-August it 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.840
 you can take a transition through 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.300
 hot example not this one 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:08.090
 go the video so seduced of trévé I 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.090
 like to remember too you can do 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:21.540
 some zoom 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:25.010
 so here if you soon you said so 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.010
 that was for the title 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.270
 if you want what is called a 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.950
 legend return to the home made 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.290
 legend is actually look at you 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:41.850
 can put a text as I go 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:44.280
 say for example it's gone video 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.670
 begins for example a really 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.670
 whatever 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:54.870
 the same thing you can do the same 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:58.470
 that in the title change the size 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.810
 so here you can very well 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:07.580
 do this and after move your text 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.580
 you want to go 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:23.050
 the legend is the same text 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.700
 appears directly also 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.830
 recorded a narration so by 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.940
 example for those who have one of the only 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.380
 who wants them not to know how 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.180
 commented think we should take 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.190
 decisions it just makes it to 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.580
 take 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:39.010
 you just have to take wind waker who 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.070
 free in addition to actually save a 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:49.720
 audio story narration you were head to 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:53.470
 head to you can save a 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.730
 terrorist it's him all me it's the 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.680
 terrifies how are you going 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.260
 found for a little gameplay on call 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.370
 of duty modern warfare 3 up you say 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:06.160
 it makes you record in an office 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.380
 for example but look instead 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:14.620
 can remove the music and watch 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:17.070
 you put your narration kept from 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.070
 relationships made 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:32.800
 let's go copy delay and then 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.800
 in the ration actually stick to the east 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.370
 and here is your story I hope this 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:51.690
 simple tutorial and the very effective ones 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.310
 found on windows live movie maker we 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.639
 learned something so go hi 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.540
