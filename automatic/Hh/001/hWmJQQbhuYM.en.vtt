00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:08.850
 next we explain the fault 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.550
 stored on the pc by efe 32 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.600
 which indicates that it is faulty in the sensor 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.390
 water inlet temperature 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.960
 the condition of this failure is that the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.210
 machine does not allow entry to mode 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 calibration if we turn off the machine 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 we entered the computer paid 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.570
 Calibration one left 3 to the right 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.570
 or the left 1 to the right 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 one two three four 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.970
 the test four calibration we touch 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 start 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.410
 there starts the calibration 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.640
 immediately it goes off does not end the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.159
 calibration what they should do is 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.309
 replace the entire transmitter this 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.930
 television in the part at the base is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 corroÃ­do is short so that the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 machine recognizes or detects a fault in 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.420
 the temperature sensor if you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.650
 energizes the circuit 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.650
 of the valves 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.320
 123 to test 3 than the manual test 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.150
 we started the first test of the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.270
 cold water valve and energizes 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.660
 but the one that is short on the term 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.660
 hot water 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.170
 we turn off the machine 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.720
 is corrected in the following way 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.720
 completely replace the harness 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 in j &amp; j 3 there I have one that is in 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.670
 good condition is the term that I sense the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.600
 water temperature 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.600
 He acts 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.319
 for reward signal 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.670
 if the water is cold 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.250
 he sent a minor reading 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.810
 and if the water is hot calling 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.680
 a signal 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 to the times in scale of 1 equal high and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.709
 tells you that you are censing this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 term is short that must be 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.950
 replace 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.030
 has a click of pressure 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 and it is dismantled 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.280
 here at the bottom 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.490
 has corrosion 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.490
 it must be replaced install the new one 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.370
 is install the valves 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.799
 also good I have the tools 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.450
 these tables are disassembled and installed 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.840
 the news 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.470
 we enter the mode again 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.470
 calibration 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.130
 1 2 3 4 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.650
 and here the machine finishes its calibration 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.430
 this the way to correct the fault efe 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.430
 32
