00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.290
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.779
 latest test video as you see have 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.510
 I'm a big bauble this time 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.550
 for you want to introduce yourself and for 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.320
 all those who say I do not know 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.009
 What that is forfeits here behind 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.210
 a kind of automatic curling iron 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.800
 automatic that you stop 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.499
 just a strand of hair in this 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.419
 device puts in and after some 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.189
 seconds you automatically get one 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.839
 desired curl out 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.300
 Of course that's just about practical 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.450
 for people like me, the curls 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.040
 have and regularly around it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.350
 experiment like but honestly 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.430
 not really have the talent for it 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.320
 what comes out nice indeed the device 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.870
 I already have myself in more often 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.820
 You can see various broadcasts 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.100
 in the evening or at night that was interspersed 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.680
 child does not hit then you stop 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.840
 Of course, such things or gets something 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.940
 just presented and socks the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.700
 are really supposed to come out 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 So knew better than the hairdresser 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.210
 I would say that has within 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.450
 from a few seconds so of course 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.689
 was quite curious if the whole 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.530
 does the device itself you see 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:18.460
 you already plastic that really 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.829
 completely as high quality awesome 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.740
 it would be right to call it fabricated 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.799
 hand would be difficult though 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.060
 as the ultimate thing to do 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.590
 behind is the 360 Â° connection what 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.569
 Of course it is also very practical and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.369
 the controls are on one 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.869
 then I just divorce it 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.649
 here it is at 140 degrees 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:50.319
 stopped and depends on the catches 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.170
 Continue to advertise quite quickly 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.119
 I would say it takes about 10 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.849
 up to 15 seconds then the normal 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.639
 Temperature reaches next to the temperature 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:05.109
 they can of course also the elements 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:07.310
 it could go up to 230 degrees 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.229
 Of course you can, too 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.440
 determine the mode how long should the whole 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.220
 keep warm between 8 and 15 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.440
 seconds you have the choice then 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.860
 gives the whole and comes out stop 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.900
 a curl yes then you could also 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.610
 still determine which curl or in 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.460
 which direction the situation be turned 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.260
 should not and it is not it is quite nice 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.660
 and you have seen it, it really is 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.880
 charged quite fast as the whole 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:45.320
 I'll show you now 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:47.870
 something but i just wanted to 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.110
 Try not now accordingly 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.840
 Highly fought or copied or what I do 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.500
 At the time, it was freshly washed all over 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 look around dry without additives or 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.790
 something similar 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 since I was already around yesterday evening 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.570
 I've experimented and I just 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.209
 I want to show the best result 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.060
 now just 15 customers and 20 degrees 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.709
 adjusted 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.739
 officially, my love and mine 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.410
 annual hair maximum then why 40 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.590
 be treated degree because just one 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.750
 have extremely fine he sees you take 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:31.440
 Already here whom can about ten 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.870
 centimeters to use 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.320
 take this round side open side with you 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.959
 is very important to your head because 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.959
 otherwise it will not work 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.959
 announce 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.519
 bridge and then play frequently 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.659
 and now here comes out immediately so 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.819
 I can lure really beautiful 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.670
 personally not with reaching but one 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.670
 will stop that small 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.010
 fiction light is not burning 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:12.590
 sacred to others high demands i 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:19.459
 I do not know yet but I recognize something 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:22.250
 Do you see it echoes and works 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.690
 a funny thing and the one for that 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.620
 some in between holiday or 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.840
 you can do the same if you still 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 have questions similar to the products can 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.820
 you do not choose the questions I answer 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.820
