00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.209
 foot gentlemen of on the asphalt because we are with people proba xix in a 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.900
 workshop percent to be tested with when it was already named a distinguished customer 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.580
 devastating like these I have caused him to be a student. 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.900
 because we have a recipe for today a recipe for 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.899
 automotive embellishment and that if we have chemistry rock is choir color 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.329
 that there is already and that although he does not skip a little and preach that he is 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.659
 that the one you did because it has parts where it's opaque and they would have 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.520
 so much in irapuato this in this case we are going to see a complete process 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.400
 what is being exterior paint treatment 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.460
 here what is commonly done is this settling in the central ugt cement 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 is this to pass the league through the entire vehicle 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.780
 to eliminate what is called orange peel which is this an average effect 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.000
 diffuse of the paint how much newly applied 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 After that, the process of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.580
 or copper 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.930
 the scoring is to eliminate all igea marks on the paint to be with 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.340
 a surface as flat as possible with a mirror finish 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.730
 after the copper in chili at the bottom, it is about removing all 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.980
 small imperfections that leaves us 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.340
 and then the police we ended up with would not have been and whatever it is that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960
 painting gives us protection if that teacher out we are to give hakim 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.380
 cieza that you notice here is 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.590
 with the league 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 who paid for it with checks 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.369
 he also revealed I made these here by applying a product 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.909
 in a sponge there sponges percent and he told me that his concepts 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.689
 specific and less so is it looks then depending on how imperfect it is 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.370
 the vehicle, well, let's say, establishing an order at a few 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.990
 from which will provide us with a greater correction to those that provide us 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 perfect way 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.759
 This must be determined depending on the type of paint your vehicle has 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.799
 it is not the same to have this a painting say of a utility vehicle 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.910
 basic 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.070
 Athenaeum out there a luxury vehicle and that is that the paint differ in quality and 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.949
 in hardness then you have to determine first 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.669
 what sponge and what polish do we need the team to apply to you here we go 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.309
 Apply an orange sponge that is designed for polite and we will 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.329
 use a cutting multimeter to eliminate list marks 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.209
 and people can confuse there is the senate already there was nice it's not because 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.750
 it's because they applied they opened the way 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.480
 look he would have entered it is like an analogy our bull skin we occupy 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.379
 cream to keep our skin moisturizing 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.449
 in the paintings is the same the paintings are received a point is an intense 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.609
 split by the sun rays the exmo and so on 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.019
 he would have been giving us is a slight protection 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.299
 because they contain oils that do not keep the paint 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:19.769
