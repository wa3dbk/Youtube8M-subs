18 had a fight with Fujita even though
she<00:01:25.100> made<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.610> look<00:01:25.730> easy

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
she made it look easy

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.790 
she made it look easy

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.560 
but I didn't really like that fight not
it's<00:01:28.100> not<00:01:28.250> because<00:01:28.580> it's<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.210> because<00:01:29.360> of

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
it's not because it's not because of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.040 
it's not because it's not because of
Fujita<00:01:30.170> loss<00:01:30.530> it's<00:01:31.400> just<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.150> don't<00:01:32.870> know

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
think that I think the only reason why

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.439 
think that I think the only reason why
18<00:05:15.280> existed<00:05:16.280> in<00:05:16.400> Dragon<00:05:16.759> Ball<00:05:16.789> GT

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
18 existed in Dragon Ball GT

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.390 
18 existed in Dragon Ball GT
even<00:05:17.900> though<00:05:18.050> Toriyama<00:05:18.830> didn't<00:05:19.069> have<00:05:19.220> no

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
even though Toriyama didn't have no

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.279 
even though Toriyama didn't have no
connection<00:05:19.910> with<00:05:20.030> Dragon<00:05:20.389> Ball<00:05:20.539> GT<00:05:20.569> but<00:05:21.169> the

connection with Dragon Ball GT but the

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.689 
connection with Dragon Ball GT but the
only<00:05:21.500> reason<00:05:21.770> why<00:05:22.300> 18<00:05:23.300> was<00:05:24.229> even<00:05:24.699> acknowledged

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
only reason why 18 was even acknowledged

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.180 
only reason why 18 was even acknowledged
or<00:05:25.880> what<00:05:26.270> was<00:05:26.419> even<00:05:26.720> seen<00:05:26.960> in<00:05:27.199> GT<00:05:27.530> was<00:05:27.860> due<00:05:28.070> to

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
or what was even seen in GT was due to

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.480 
or what was even seen in GT was due to
the<00:05:28.310> fact<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.669> 17<00:05:29.360> you<00:05:30.020> know<00:05:30.139> 17<00:05:30.710> became

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
the fact that 17 you know 17 became

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.510 
the fact that 17 you know 17 became
super<00:05:31.849> 17<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:33.410> they<00:05:33.650> had<00:05:33.830> no<00:05:33.860> choice<00:05:34.039> but<00:05:34.460> to

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
super 17 so they had no choice but to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.240 
super 17 so they had no choice but to
bring<00:05:34.789> 18<00:05:35.270> back<00:05:35.539> and<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.110> was<00:05:36.199> like<00:05:36.229> well<00:05:37.009> we

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
bring 18 back and it was like well we

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.129

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
can't leave and enjoy 18 now we had to

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.189 
can't leave and enjoy 18 now we had to

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
bring her into the mix so actually if it

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.420 
bring her into the mix so actually if it

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
wasn't for Super 17 Android 18 probably

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.029
