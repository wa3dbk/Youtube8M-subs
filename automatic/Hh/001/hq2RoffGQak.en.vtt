mode which puts her in a lower gear and

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.000 
mode which puts her in a lower gear and
then<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.200> P<00:00:40.740> mode<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.160> well<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> drive<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:43.500> got

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
then a P mode as well so drive I've got

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.180 
then a P mode as well so drive I've got
about<00:00:44.100> thirty<00:00:44.520> two<00:00:44.760> miles<00:00:44.970> on<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.360> car<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
about thirty two miles on this car and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.920 
about thirty two miles on this car and
it<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:47.550> track<00:00:47.850> car<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> dealership

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it is our track car for the dealership

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.160 
it is our track car for the dealership
so<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.530> some<00:00:49.559> plates<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.720> I<00:00:51.720> just

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
so it's got some plates on it I just

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
so it's got some plates on it I just
signed<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:52.620> agreement<00:00:52.830> that<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.520> shouldn't

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
signed an agreement that I shouldn't

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.430 
signed an agreement that I shouldn't
smash<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.870> car<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.410> should<00:00:56.040> be<00:00:56.070> good<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.430> go

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
smash up the car so should be good to go

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
smash up the car so should be good to go
Kurt<00:00:58.440> doesn't<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.890> seatbelt<00:00:59.160> mode<00:00:59.520> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
Kurt doesn't have a seatbelt mode so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.320 
Kurt doesn't have a seatbelt mode so
we'll<00:01:00.180> figure<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.839> before<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.180> take<00:01:03.180> them

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
we'll figure that out before I take them

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.479 
we'll figure that out before I take them
down<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.050> 11<00:01:04.559> airbags<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.370> in

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
down with you 11 airbags that are in

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
down with you 11 airbags that are in
here<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> good

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
here it's got a little bit of good

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260 
here it's got a little bit of good
acceleration<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:08.909> already<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
acceleration I think I'm already up to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.500 
acceleration I think I'm already up to
20<00:01:09.750> coming<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> stop<00:01:10.590> sign<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:11.190> think<00:01:11.970> for

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
20 coming up to a stop sign I think for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
20 coming up to a stop sign I think for
under<00:01:13.170> 100<00:01:13.530> horsepower<00:01:13.800> it's<00:01:14.250> got<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> lot<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
under 100 horsepower it's got a lot of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
under 100 horsepower it's got a lot of
power<00:01:14.820> especially<00:01:15.030> compared<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.280> smart

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
power especially compared to the smart

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
power especially compared to the smart
car<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.240> 70<00:01:18.720> horsepower<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.900> we're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
car which is like 70 horsepower so we're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
car which is like 70 horsepower so we're
going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.620> little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:23.010> on<00:01:23.040> city

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
going to take it a little bit on city

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to take it a little bit on city
drive<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.760> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> highway<00:01:24.570> driving

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
drive a little bit of highway driving

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.500 
drive a little bit of highway driving
and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:26.630> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> finalize<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.500> think

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
and then kind of finalize what we think

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.240 
and then kind of finalize what we think
it's<00:01:30.510> got<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> odometer<00:01:31.260> that<00:01:31.409> goes<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.830> 120

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's got a odometer that goes up to 120

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
it's got a odometer that goes up to 120
and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> don't<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> make<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and I don't know if we can make it that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.350 
and I don't know if we can make it that
far<00:01:34.009> or<00:01:35.009> without<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> blown<00:01:35.850> up

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
far or without it blown up

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740 
far or without it blown up
just<00:01:36.840> get<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.729> they<00:01:38.729> say<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.210> safe<00:01:39.509> at

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
just get in they say it's pretty safe at

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.639 
just get in they say it's pretty safe at
70<00:01:40.409> 80<00:01:40.560> miles<00:01:40.799> an<00:01:40.979> hour<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
70 80 miles an hour I think for the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.730 
70 80 miles an hour I think for the
acceleration<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.740> pretty

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
acceleration for what it is it's pretty

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.289 
acceleration for what it is it's pretty
good<00:01:46.950> choice<00:01:47.539> especially<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.049> 37

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
good choice especially to get 37

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.410 
good choice especially to get 37
estimated<00:01:51.299> miles<00:01:51.689> per<00:01:51.930> gallon<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> city

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.620 

so<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.080> posted<00:01:56.350> up<00:01:56.620> I'm<00:01:56.830> going<00:01:57.040> about<00:01:57.159> 40<00:01:57.729> it's

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
so I posted up I'm going about 40 it's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.290 
so I posted up I'm going about 40 it's
pretty<00:01:58.870> quiet<00:01:59.140> for<00:01:59.680> being<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.760> little<00:02:00.940> bit<00:02:01.090> over

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
pretty quiet for being a little bit over

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.589 
pretty quiet for being a little bit over
10<00:02:01.570> foot<00:02:01.840> long

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.690 

it's<00:02:08.810> not<00:02:08.959> really<00:02:09.289> any<00:02:09.409> road<00:02:09.979> noise<00:02:10.189> for<00:02:10.579> what

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
it's not really any road noise for what

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's not really any road noise for what
it<00:02:10.789> is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.630 

I'm<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:15.019> about<00:02:15.580> 44<00:02:16.580> miles<00:02:16.790> an<00:02:17.060> hour

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.010 

we're<00:02:23.090> going<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.270> be<00:02:23.360> merging<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.900> freeway

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
we're going to be merging on the freeway

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:42.740 
we're going to be merging on the freeway
here<00:02:24.650> Charlie

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.630 

so<00:02:43.350> I'm<00:02:43.440> about<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.800> merge<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.190> freeway<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
so I'm about to merge on the freeway I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.860 
so I'm about to merge on the freeway I
want<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.970> kind<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
want to kind of see what the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.400 
want to kind of see what the
acceleration<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.770> I'm<00:02:46.980> going<00:02:47.310> 45<00:02:48.140> if<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.230> hit

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
acceleration is I'm going 45 if I hit

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
acceleration is I'm going 45 if I hit
the<00:02:49.530> gas<00:02:49.710> again<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.310> does<00:02:50.490> have<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> good<00:02:50.910> punch

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the gas again it does have a good punch

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.580 
the gas again it does have a good punch
to<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.050> brought<00:02:52.320> me<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.590> about<00:02:52.830> 52

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.440 

so<00:03:00.980> I'm<00:03:01.040> driving<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> while<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.180> been

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
so I'm driving it for a while it's been

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.860 
so I'm driving it for a while it's been
pretty<00:03:02.900> nice<00:03:03.110> it's<00:03:03.500> been<00:03:03.830> pretty<00:03:04.550> quiet

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.170 

urghhh<00:03:07.440> under<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> freeway<00:03:08.129> I'm<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.610> 60

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
urghhh under the freeway I'm going 60

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.960 
urghhh under the freeway I'm going 60
right<00:03:09.330> now<00:03:09.860> I'm<00:03:10.860> punching<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.519> bit<00:03:11.700> see

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
right now I'm punching a little bit see

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.700 
right now I'm punching a little bit see
what<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.150> does

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
what it does

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.230 
what it does
I'm<00:03:14.190> up<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:15.290> 75<00:03:16.290> fairly<00:03:16.890> quickly<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.790> holding

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
I'm up to 75 fairly quickly it's holding

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.520 
I'm up to 75 fairly quickly it's holding
its<00:03:18.390> own<00:03:18.570> at<00:03:18.930> about<00:03:19.710> 75<00:03:20.400> miles<00:03:20.640> an<00:03:20.850> hour<00:03:21.030> I

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
its own at about 75 miles an hour I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.630 
its own at about 75 miles an hour I
think<00:03:23.420> draw<00:03:24.420> small<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.990> car<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.680> 75<00:03:26.340> it

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
think draw small this car is at 75 it

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.200 
think draw small this car is at 75 it
definitely<00:03:27.270> gets<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.750> goes

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.140 

going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.960> 85<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.550> definitely<00:03:35.550> it's<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:35.910> some

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
going to 85 and definitely it's got some

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.280 
going to 85 and definitely it's got some
power<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:37.320> actually<00:03:37.680> pretty<00:03:37.890> shocked<00:03:38.280> at

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
power it's actually pretty shocked at

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.560 
power it's actually pretty shocked at
the<00:03:40.290> acceleration<00:03:41.010> getting<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.580> 80<00:03:41.820> 85<00:03:42.300> so

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
the acceleration getting up to 80 85 so

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.540 
the acceleration getting up to 80 85 so
I'm<00:03:42.660> dropping<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.170> back<00:03:43.320> down<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.800> about<00:03:43.860> 70

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
I'm dropping it back down to about 70

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.150 
I'm dropping it back down to about 70
and<00:03:44.580> 78

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
and 78

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.010 
and 78
so<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> lot<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:47.970> people<00:03:48.240> think<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.780> car

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
so a lot of people think that this car

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.830 
so a lot of people think that this car
probably<00:03:49.790> won't<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> comfortable<00:03:51.480> ride<00:03:51.600> at

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
probably won't be a comfortable ride at

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.400 
probably won't be a comfortable ride at
7075<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.830> think<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.660> 77<00:03:54.660> miles<00:03:54.810> an<00:03:55.020> hour<00:03:55.140> it's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
7075 I think at 77 miles an hour it's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.700 
7075 I think at 77 miles an hour it's
pretty<00:03:55.650> comfortable<00:03:56.810> we've<00:03:57.810> gone<00:03:58.020> past<00:03:58.350> one

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
pretty comfortable we've gone past one

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.090 
pretty comfortable we've gone past one
exit<00:03:59.130> about<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.760> get<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.060> another<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.980> then

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
exit about to get on another and then

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.300 
exit about to get on another and then
we're<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> switch<00:04:02.700> but

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.140 

for<00:04:06.640> what<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.390> think<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:07.810> uh

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
for what it is I think it's uh

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.890 
for what it is I think it's uh
definitely<00:04:09.510> nice<00:04:09.659> car<00:04:09.989> for<00:04:10.349> about<00:04:11.209> 16,000

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.330 

you<00:04:18.169> can<00:04:18.290> probably<00:04:18.530> hear<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:18.919> on<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.009> video

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
you can probably hear it on the video

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.999 
you can probably hear it on the video
it's<00:04:19.519> pretty<00:04:19.759> quiet<00:04:20.030> at<00:04:20.600> 77<00:04:21.530> miles<00:04:21.709> an<00:04:21.919> hour

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
it's pretty quiet at 77 miles an hour

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.790 
it's pretty quiet at 77 miles an hour
it's<00:04:22.310> it's<00:04:22.669> pretty<00:04:22.880> sufficient

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:44.860 

doesn't<00:04:26.580> seem<00:04:26.759> to<00:04:26.909> like<00:04:26.940> power<00:04:27.389> at<00:04:27.629> all

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.920 

so<00:04:45.169> we're<00:04:45.260> about<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.470> get<00:04:45.710> off<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.070> exit<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.610> I

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
so we're about to get off the exit and I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.240 
so we're about to get off the exit and I
kept<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.050> constant<00:04:48.590> at<00:04:48.650> about<00:04:48.790> 7075<00:04:51.040> rigs<00:04:52.040> are

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
kept the constant at about 7075 rigs are

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:00.070 
kept the constant at about 7075 rigs are
really<00:04:52.490> good

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.920 

we<00:05:00.470> made<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.800> safely<00:05:01.129> off<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.370> exit<00:05:01.910> which<00:05:02.060> to

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
we made it safely off the exit which to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.990 
we made it safely off the exit which to
me<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.139> felt<00:05:03.680> like<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.919> could<00:05:04.099> ride<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:04.550> several

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
me I felt like I could ride for several

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.059 
me I felt like I could ride for several
miles<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.449> they're<00:05:06.080> saying<00:05:06.349> that<00:05:06.470> it's<00:05:06.680> more

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
miles and they're saying that it's more

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.279 
miles and they're saying that it's more
of<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.220> city<00:05:07.460> car<00:05:07.729> but<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.030> I'm<00:05:08.659> pretty<00:05:08.870> impressed

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
of a city car but I I'm pretty impressed

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.869 
of a city car but I I'm pretty impressed
for<00:05:09.620> driving<00:05:10.520> it

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
for driving it

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.890 
for driving it
I'm<00:05:11.750> going<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:11.960> be<00:05:12.050> turning<00:05:12.259> hero<00:05:12.680> kinda

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
I'm going to be turning hero kinda

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.779 
I'm going to be turning hero kinda
demonstrate<00:05:16.270> how<00:05:17.270> easy<00:05:17.300> does<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.990> turn<00:05:18.229> I

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
demonstrate how easy does the turn I

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.339 
demonstrate how easy does the turn I
noticed<00:05:19.789> a<00:05:19.879> little<00:05:20.030> bit<00:05:20.210> more<00:05:20.419> noise<00:05:20.659> at<00:05:20.990> lower

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
noticed a little bit more noise at lower
