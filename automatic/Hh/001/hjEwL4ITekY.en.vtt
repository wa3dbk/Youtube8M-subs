00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 hello to all hello to all and that's 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.500
 job we find ourselves for another 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.160
 episode of the world of epic mounts 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.930
 warcraft 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 the guide that allows you to have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.809
 frames of the most epic that power 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.790
 to impress for playmate today 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:49.230
 we end up on the terrace of 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:52.920
 magisteres that is right here at 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.170
 lille which of arras that is in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 up I thought home from the east we can there 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 access by flight bag bias through portal 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.339
 my name is more than he is but 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 I know that the portal to go there 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:08.549
 so in this dungeon you have to go 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 defeat the last boss the boss of the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.549
 hungry in heroic fashion but it's for 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.010
 it that we can only do a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.960
 times a day I do not remember very much 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.869
 well he drops himself 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.370
 how much percentage passing is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.510
 writes we're going to beat that she's got you and 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 not that she goes to the sun to have 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.610
 the chance to have the big perry falcon 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.950
 fast white or companion the young 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.670
 dino me it's not the first time 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.210
 I do it proof I have the game of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 phoenix already the mount that can more 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.450
 to let down 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.820
 it's this measure the offer except that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 White 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.860
 so let's go for a beat all 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:09.000
 boss one after another to come 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 sit at the end I want to emphasize 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 it's a 1 2 it's a level dungeon 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 70 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.760
 so if you are 90 you will be 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.599
 easily easy to pass 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.239
 some mob 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.620
 we already went to the first boss that 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.379
 take a second to get there 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.439
 in this room where you have to completely 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.239
 emptied the room because otherwise they 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.599
 come to attack us during the fight 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.889
 and it's really unpleasant 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:44.549
 so I kids to do it on purpose 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.889
 heart of fire here is a blood elf who 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.569
 is red 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:52.579
 I do not know why they did that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.400
 with many of the monsters there 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.549
 converted 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.030
 breeds in red to create a 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.500
 beautiful new breed 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.500
 so if all for the first boss 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.710
 in this room if already visited 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.780
 the room of the second hump that 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.660
 will find here we are not obliged 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.310
 to attack all the little wyrm on 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.880
 can do it but it's really according to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.600
 me a waste of time just have to pass 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.340
 in a draw to be directly below 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.710
 from them and here we are in front of vexa 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.170
 him what is my faith very pretty so 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.980
 no particular strategy because you 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.620
 are level relatively to the fair fact 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.620
 the attacked and it's over 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.680
 rod second here to point out if 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.329
 these strange characters from a cork 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.269
 troops 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.219
 it's supposed to spot points 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.769
 unfortunately it's like a 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.230
 little pop animation can not join him there 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.590
 even with a double view I would have 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.880
 appreciated but hey we can not we can 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.620
 only observed from afar these monsters to 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:33.889
 500 middle who are not niggling us healthy and 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:38.360
 by totally ignoring us as you 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:42.800
 see here I managed not to agree 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.389
 none of these bob's which avoids us a 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.639
 crazy time that avoids us to do the 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.840
 time to waste a crazy time beating 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.750
 unnecessary characters to eliminate and 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.060
 able to go about your business after 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.759
 have tried your luck once a 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.900
 day wanted his fellows 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:05.060
 so here it's even simpler than 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.150
 the others I believe that the difficulty 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.560
 during the real dungeon this theme that 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.350
 is the sum to a rape and dangers 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.320
 dps with it but in fact they are 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.229
 the rhyming tips cut and ended 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.300
 always so simple 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:28.789
 and finally we get to the last boss 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.490
 have crossed I think and a few small 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.849
 trash that's it i'm going united just for 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.000
 have a room completely free and 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.000
 here we are in front of the famous character 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.820
 in fact the peaks actually 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.370
 6 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.260
 so here's the little introduction that 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:20.720
 makes us already shake our knees 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:23.810
 before these 440 caudry and this is the 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.290
 attack always again 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.639
 really very simple before demonstrates if 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.520
 simple one must know it from luck 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.889
 so the passes in a second phase 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.030
 who throw us in am and north 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:43.810
 but we just keep typing him 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.810
 and it's over 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:59.819
 ah my god I reached the climax of 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:04.889
 fear and unfortunately I do not read 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:07.680
 sure so that's all they do 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.279
 this is what is done to me in this tutorial 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.520
 on the frames on us on this 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:17.270
 mount there and look forward to seeing you 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.629
 in future videos 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.439
 if some had recognized noticed at 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:27.059
 beginning of the video game 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:30.330
 I was walking on my flying cloud 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.770
 red I believe can be doing a 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.759
 next tauriel on this mount 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:40.139
 Locke is still extremely simple 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:42.360
 to have one must know the same step of the 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:45.869
 patience you have to pick up objects 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.259
 suffers and a description more more 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:51.240
 detailed in the tauriel project so 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.270
 that's what makes me to videos 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.349
 Looking forward to seeing you again, thank you very much 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.349
 and have a good day
