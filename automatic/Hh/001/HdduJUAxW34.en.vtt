00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.540
cars.com auto review

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.299
I'm Mike Hanley with cars.com now in
its fifth model year the 2011 Jaguar XK

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.690
has

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.230
age remarkably well in the XKR model
like this one here packs

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.300
a big punch thanks to a supercharged v8
engine

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.730
with a starting price of more than one
hundred thousand dollars you expect

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.550
everything to be top notch in this car
when you get inside

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.210
that's not the case the XK receive some
mild styling tweaks last year that we're

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.349
focused on this

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.140
new front and befor 2011 the look is
much the same but that doesn't diminish

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860
the presence and grace that this
convertible has

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.320
takes around 20 seconds the lower or
raise the soft top and when it's down to

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.890
Stow's under this hard tonneau cover
that gives the car

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.230
a clean finish the parents traveling on
the highway with the top down its

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.010
toughly breezy inside but it's not
overly so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.039
and one thing I like about the st.
convertibles that has a stiff body

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.789
structure

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.089
is not a shaking her jiggling that
you're getting some convertibles

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.059
XK received a big bump in horsepower for
the 2010 model year thanks to a new

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.660
supercharged v8 engine that straight up
510 horsepower

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.890
and its strong enough to accelerate this
car from zero to 60 in just

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.930
4.6 seconds that's pretty fast for car
this page was deeply impressed about the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840
engine is that high-speed passing car

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.090
in with part throttle acceleration this
car surges forward at highway speeds

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.630
next cares fitted with a six-speed
automatic transmission that includes

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.729
paddle shifters on the steering wheel
for manual control gear changes

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.250
now a lot of cars have systems like this
but they aren't always the most engaging

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.979
to use because they're slow to react
when you press wanna paddles that's not

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.350
the case in the XKR

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.979
press one for an option for the other
one for a downshift

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.790
you get immediate response that's
probably gonna make you more likely to

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.240
use it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.969
next care theoretically has room for
four people but if take a look at the

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.210
back seat you can tell most people prior
would be comfortable back there

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.939
interior does have its nice finishes
like these leather seats

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.780
black and chrome buy-ins and suede
rapping on the A pillar

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.360
but there are also some down market
elements that are appropriate in a car

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.869
the start some more than a hundred
thousand dollars like the window

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.380
switches and near controls

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.770
and also the on-board navigation system
which is woefully slow to react when

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.310
moving through the various things that
offers when the other partition in place

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.290
for the soft top or not yes care strike
is pretty small

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.830
so plan on bringing some soft luggage if
you're going on a trip or I guess you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.410
can put those

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.940
rear sees the some use innkeeper things
back there to fully utilize the xkr-s

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.120
performance potential you really need a
racetrack so if you don't have one of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.190
those at your disposal I'd recommend
going with the less expensive

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.190
XK because it has all the style the XKR
and nearly as much to the quickness

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.850
