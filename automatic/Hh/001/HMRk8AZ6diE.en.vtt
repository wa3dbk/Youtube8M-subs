because<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> dragon<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> amazing<00:01:10.289> and<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
because this dragon is amazing and it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
because this dragon is amazing and it
can<00:01:10.979> breathe<00:01:11.189> fire<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
can breathe fire as you will see in a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.850 
can breathe fire as you will see in a
minute<00:01:14.720> also<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.869> town<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.110> made<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> wood

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
minute also my town is made out of wood

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.300 
minute also my town is made out of wood
so<00:01:17.069> that's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.399> perfectly<00:01:17.909> safe<00:01:18.569> combination

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
so that's a perfectly safe combination

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.889 
so that's a perfectly safe combination
but<00:01:20.310> aside<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.819> that<00:01:21.060> let's<00:01:21.630> burn<00:01:21.869> some

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.639 
colors I think I'm not really sure but I
want<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.720> rid<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:30.929> them<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.200> I'll<00:01:31.619> just
