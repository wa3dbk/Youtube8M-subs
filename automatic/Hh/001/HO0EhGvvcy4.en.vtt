00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
leave the blend images together selected

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.969 
leave the blend images together selected
and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> also<00:01:36.360> click<00:01:36.869> vignette<00:01:37.439> removal

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and then I also click vignette removal

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.980 
and then I also click vignette removal
because<00:01:38.250> it'll<00:01:38.490> blend<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.909> images<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.540> lot

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
because it'll blend the images a lot

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.069 
because it'll blend the images a lot
better<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.770> leave<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.640> unchecked

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
better than if you leave that unchecked

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.999 
better than if you leave that unchecked
and<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.380> leave

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and I also leave

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.100 
and I also leave
geometric<00:01:44.549> distortion<00:01:44.790> correction<00:01:45.630> off

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
geometric distortion correction off

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.649 
geometric distortion correction off
because<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.939> later<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
because I actually do that later and I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
because I actually do that later and I
think<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.350> better<00:01:49.619> process

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
think it's actually a better process

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.530 
think it's actually a better process
when<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> afterwards<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:53.450> we're<00:01:54.450> gonna

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
when you do it afterwards so we're gonna

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
when you do it afterwards so we're gonna
click<00:01:54.750> OK<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> start<00:01:58.530> working

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
click OK and it's going to start working

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.200 
click OK and it's going to start working
with<00:01:59.310> our<00:01:59.549> images

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.710 

cool<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.600> our<00:02:10.020> pano<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.710> done<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:12.210> looks<00:02:12.390> pretty

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
cool so our pano is done it looks pretty

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.600 
cool so our pano is done it looks pretty
good<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.560> there's<00:02:13.800> definitely<00:02:14.220> some<00:02:14.370> things

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
good but there's definitely some things

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.770 
good but there's definitely some things
we<00:02:14.880> need<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:15.930> before<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:17.780> start

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
we need to do to it now before we start

which I will be showing you guys in
another<00:02:23.100> video<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.840> first<00:02:25.050> thing<00:02:25.230> I'm

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
another video but the first thing I'm

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.130 
another video but the first thing I'm
gonna<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.270> combine<00:02:27.270> all<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:27.840> layers

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
gonna do is combine all these layers

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.370 
gonna do is combine all these layers
using<00:02:28.650> command<00:02:29.130> II<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.200> one

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
using command II just so I have one

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.820 
using command II just so I have one
solid<00:02:31.860> layer<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:33.300> need<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.570> start

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
solid layer and we need to start

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.910 
solid layer and we need to start
correcting<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:35.160> distortion<00:02:36.800> finding<00:02:37.800> our

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
correcting for distortion finding our

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
correcting for distortion finding our
crop<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:38.700> image<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:40.020> what<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:40.410> I'm

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
crop on this image so what I think I'm

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.160 
crop on this image so what I think I'm
going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.250> go<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.820> edit<00:02:42.170> transform

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
going to do is go up to edit transform

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.840 
going to do is go up to edit transform
and<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.700> perspective<00:02:45.510> tool<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.760> gonna

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
and the perspective tool and I'm gonna

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.120 
and the perspective tool and I'm gonna
correct<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.480> slight<00:02:49.290> perspective

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
correct this slight perspective

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.740 
correct this slight perspective
distortion<00:02:50.450> just<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.630> our<00:02:51.840> vertical<00:02:52.350> lines

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
distortion just get our vertical lines

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.530 
distortion just get our vertical lines
looking<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.870> little<00:02:54.960> more<00:02:55.110> straight<00:02:56.540> looks

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
looking a little more straight looks

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.400 
looking a little more straight looks
good

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
good

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.720 
good
now<00:03:00.410> what<00:03:00.590> I'm<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.310> back<00:03:01.340> up

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
now what I'm going to do is go back up

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.580 
now what I'm going to do is go back up
to<00:03:01.850> edit<00:03:02.410> go<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:05.110> actually<00:03:06.110> let's<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.350> do

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
to edit go to actually let's just do

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.790 
to edit go to actually let's just do
free<00:03:06.920> transform<00:03:07.520> which<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.730> command<00:03:08.270> T<00:03:08.800> and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
free transform which is command T and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.670 
free transform which is command T and
I'm<00:03:10.190> going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.610> push<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.540> image<00:03:11.960> down<00:03:12.620> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
I'm going to push this image down a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.760 
I'm going to push this image down a
little<00:03:13.040> bit<00:03:13.480> make<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.510> look<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.170> little<00:03:15.470> less

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
little bit make it look a little less

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.420 
little bit make it look a little less
stretched<00:03:16.400> out<00:03:18.970> give<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.210> wider

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
stretched out give it that wider

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.480 
stretched out give it that wider
panorama<00:03:22.430> perspective<00:03:24.040> that's<00:03:25.040> good<00:03:25.280> right

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
panorama perspective that's good right

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.839 
panorama perspective that's good right
there

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.110 

and<00:03:28.469> now<00:03:29.469> what<00:03:29.739> we're<00:03:29.890> gonna<00:03:29.980> do<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.609> correct

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and now what we're gonna do is correct

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.739 
and now what we're gonna do is correct
for<00:03:31.480> our<00:03:31.810> crooked<00:03:32.849> horizon<00:03:33.849> so<00:03:34.510> I'm<00:03:34.599> gonna

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:34.749 
for our crooked horizon so I'm gonna

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.830 
for our crooked horizon so I'm gonna
bring<00:03:34.989> down<00:03:35.319> if<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.159> basically<00:03:36.639> hold<00:03:37.389> down

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
bring down if you basically hold down

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.190 
bring down if you basically hold down
your<00:03:38.290> mouse<00:03:38.799> on<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.480> ruler<00:03:40.480> which<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.079> you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
your mouse on the ruler which if you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.379 
your mouse on the ruler which if you
don't<00:03:41.319> have<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> ruler<00:03:41.950> out<00:03:42.159> it's<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.639> command

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
don't have the ruler out it's a command

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.940 
don't have the ruler out it's a command
R<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:46.000> select<00:03:46.870> down<00:03:47.079> on<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.379> ruler<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
R if you select down on the ruler and

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.339 
R if you select down on the ruler and
you<00:03:48.219> bring<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.609> down<00:03:48.730> it'll<00:03:49.180> bring<00:03:49.989> out<00:03:50.139> this

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
you bring it down it'll bring out this

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.250 
you bring it down it'll bring out this
cyan<00:03:51.000> line<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.389> that's<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.750> help<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:53.019> line<00:03:53.230> up

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
cyan line and that's to help you line up

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.949 
cyan line and that's to help you line up
your<00:03:53.530> image<00:03:53.889> that<00:03:54.760> won't<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.299> there<00:03:55.510> when<00:03:55.569> you

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
your image that won't be there when you

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.750 
your image that won't be there when you
export<00:03:56.530> your<00:03:56.709> image<00:03:57.010> that's<00:03:57.219> only<00:03:57.459> for

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
export your image that's only for

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.819 
export your image that's only for
reference<00:03:57.939> so<00:03:58.900> we're<00:03:59.049> gonna<00:03:59.169> use<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.409> right

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
reference so we're gonna use that right

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.229 
reference so we're gonna use that right
now<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:01.469> line<00:04:02.469> it<00:04:02.620> up<00:04:02.709> with<00:04:02.859> our<00:04:03.010> image<00:04:03.489> and

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
now and line it up with our image and

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.050 
now and line it up with our image and
then<00:04:04.389> we're<00:04:04.480> gonna<00:04:04.569> go<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.840> edit<00:04:06.060> transform

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
then we're gonna go to edit transform

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.939 
then we're gonna go to edit transform
and<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:08.260> warp<00:04:08.530> tool<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:10.469> from<00:04:11.469> this<00:04:11.680> point

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
and the warp tool and from this point

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.949 
and the warp tool and from this point
you<00:04:12.669> basically<00:04:12.819> just<00:04:13.209> need<00:04:13.419> to<00:04:13.659> warp<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
you basically just need to warp the

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.599 
you basically just need to warp the
image<00:04:14.379> to<00:04:14.620> get<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.799> horizon<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.430> look

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
image to get the horizon to look

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.430 
image to get the horizon to look
straight<00:04:15.909> and<00:04:16.630> that's<00:04:16.750> just<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.109> matter<00:04:17.289> of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
straight and that's just a matter of

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.439 
straight and that's just a matter of
kind<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:17.949> pushing<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.489> pulling<00:04:18.669> with<00:04:19.419> the

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
kind of pushing and pulling with the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.830 
kind of pushing and pulling with the
different<00:04:20.849> the<00:04:21.849> different<00:04:22.150> key<00:04:22.360> points<00:04:22.780> here

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
different the different key points here

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.469 
different the different key points here
you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.710> select<00:04:24.039> in<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.400> middle<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.030> distort

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
you can select in the middle and distort

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.670 
you can select in the middle and distort
it<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.750> way<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:27.750> am<00:04:28.750> going<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.139> select<00:04:29.349> this

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
it that way I am going to select this

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.820 
it that way I am going to select this
end<00:04:29.889> point<00:04:30.220> right<00:04:30.490> here<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:30.849> bring<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.270> up

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.710 

and<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.949> noticed<00:04:39.280> there's<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.550> little<00:04:39.720> bump

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
and I noticed there's a little bump

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.510 
and I noticed there's a little bump
going<00:04:41.080> up<00:04:41.229> here<00:04:41.560> too<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:42.099> I'm<00:04:42.190> gonna<00:04:42.310> bring

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
going up here too so I'm gonna bring

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.490 
going up here too so I'm gonna bring
this<00:04:42.669> down<00:04:42.940> just<00:04:42.970> like<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:46.289> that's<00:04:47.289> looking

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
this down just like and that's looking

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.890 
this down just like and that's looking
pretty<00:04:47.620> good<00:04:47.979> actually<00:04:48.599> doesn't<00:04:49.599> look<00:04:49.630> too

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
pretty good actually doesn't look too

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.300 
pretty good actually doesn't look too
bad

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.790 

so<00:04:54.310> now<00:04:54.460> what<00:04:54.640> I'm<00:04:54.730> going<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.910> do<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.530> crop<00:04:56.530> the

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
so now what I'm going to do is crop the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.830 
so now what I'm going to do is crop the
image<00:04:57.100> or<00:04:57.310> at<00:04:57.400> least<00:04:57.580> find<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.120> crop<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
image or at least find the crop for the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:08.130 
image or at least find the crop for the
image<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:06.160> it's<00:05:06.790> okay<00:05:07.090> if<00:05:07.120> we<00:05:07.360> leave<00:05:07.570> some<00:05:07.990> of

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
image and it's okay if we leave some of

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.090 
image and it's okay if we leave some of
this<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:10.510> area<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.200> doesn't<00:05:11.410> have<00:05:11.560> image

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
this this area that doesn't have image

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.590 
this this area that doesn't have image
it's<00:05:12.400> okay<00:05:12.700> if<00:05:12.820> we<00:05:12.970> have<00:05:13.150> some<00:05:13.450> of<00:05:13.570> that

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
it's okay if we have some of that

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:23.930 
it's okay if we have some of that
because<00:05:14.110> we're<00:05:14.290> going<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.500> fix<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:15.100> later

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.700 

get<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:24.970> nice<00:05:25.210> rule<00:05:25.570> of<00:05:25.720> thirds<00:05:26.050> on<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.740> image

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
get a nice rule of thirds on the image

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.340 
get a nice rule of thirds on the image
all<00:05:29.710> right<00:05:31.800> now<00:05:32.800> what<00:05:33.040> we<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.280> do<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:34.350> fix

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
all right now what we can do is fix

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.040 
all right now what we can do is fix
these<00:05:35.590> areas<00:05:36.130> which<00:05:36.610> don't<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:37.090> image<00:05:37.570> the

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
these areas which don't have image the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.210 
these areas which don't have image the
first<00:05:38.230> thing<00:05:38.410> I'm<00:05:38.500> going<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:38.650> do<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:39.010> go<00:05:39.190> back

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
first thing I'm going to do is go back

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.700 
first thing I'm going to do is go back
to<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.730> warp<00:05:40.210> tool<00:05:40.480> and<00:05:40.840> I'm<00:05:41.380> going<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.560> just

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
to that warp tool and I'm going to just

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.670 
to that warp tool and I'm going to just
bring<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.130> sky<00:05:42.400> up<00:05:42.550> just<00:05:42.910> a<00:05:43.060> little<00:05:43.390> bit<00:05:43.680> just

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
bring the sky up just a little bit just

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.150 
bring the sky up just a little bit just
a<00:05:44.860> patch<00:05:45.100> in<00:05:45.430> some<00:05:45.700> of<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:45.910> area<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.860> it'll<00:05:51.040> be

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
a patch in some of that area so it'll be

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.210 
a patch in some of that area so it'll be
easier<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.580> work<00:05:51.700> with<00:05:52.770> now<00:05:53.770> these<00:05:53.950> two

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
easier to work with now these two

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.170 
easier to work with now these two
corners<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:56.260> we're<00:05:56.440> working<00:05:56.770> on<00:05:57.030> we<00:05:58.030> can

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
corners that we're working on we can

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.640 
corners that we're working on we can
actually<00:05:58.330> just<00:05:58.630> fill<00:05:58.930> in<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.230> rest<00:05:59.380> of<00:05:59.560> the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
actually just fill in the rest of the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.840 
actually just fill in the rest of the
sky<00:05:59.950> using<00:06:01.140> content-aware<00:06:02.640> so<00:06:03.640> I'm<00:06:03.730> just

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
sky using content-aware so I'm just

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.140 
sky using content-aware so I'm just
going<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.090> take<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.930> lasso<00:06:05.770> tool<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.640> I'm

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
going to take the lasso tool and I'm

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.010 
going to take the lasso tool and I'm
going<00:06:07.240> to<00:06:07.330> quickly<00:06:08.110> just<00:06:08.500> draw<00:06:08.770> over<00:06:10.020> the

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
going to quickly just draw over the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.930 
going to quickly just draw over the
corner<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:12.000> then<00:06:13.000> right<00:06:13.600> click<00:06:14.010> fill<00:06:15.010> and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
corner and then right click fill and

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.370 
corner and then right click fill and
then<00:06:16.120> content<00:06:16.630> where<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:19.140> obviously<00:06:20.140> this

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
then content where and obviously this

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.670 
then content where and obviously this
only<00:06:20.560> works<00:06:20.920> with<00:06:21.100> simple<00:06:22.020> you<00:06:23.020> know<00:06:23.140> simple

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
only works with simple you know simple

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.960 
only works with simple you know simple
skies<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:25.290> you<00:06:26.290> know<00:06:27.160> areas<00:06:27.640> that<00:06:27.850> are

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
skies and you know areas that are

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.030 
skies and you know areas that are
repeatable<00:06:28.450> you<00:06:28.870> know<00:06:28.990> if<00:06:29.260> there's<00:06:29.500> a<00:06:29.560> giant

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
repeatable you know if there's a giant

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.860 
repeatable you know if there's a giant
pole<00:06:30.310> coming<00:06:30.700> out<00:06:30.820> right<00:06:31.030> here<00:06:31.240> you're<00:06:31.780> gonna

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
pole coming out right here you're gonna

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.570 
pole coming out right here you're gonna
need<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:32.290> do<00:06:32.470> all<00:06:32.680> this<00:06:32.830> yourself<00:06:33.010> with<00:06:33.490> the

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
need to do all this yourself with the

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.750 
need to do all this yourself with the
clone<00:06:33.880> stamp<00:06:34.120> but<00:06:34.980> we're<00:06:35.980> lucky<00:06:36.460> with<00:06:36.610> this

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
clone stamp but we're lucky with this

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.710 
clone stamp but we're lucky with this
sky<00:06:37.060> and<00:06:37.330> we<00:06:37.480> can<00:06:37.600> just<00:06:38.580> do<00:06:39.580> it<00:06:39.730> like<00:06:39.880> this<00:06:40.180> and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
sky and we can just do it like this and

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.540 
sky and we can just do it like this and
the<00:06:40.930> program<00:06:41.380> is<00:06:41.590> smart<00:06:41.950> enough<00:06:42.160> to<00:06:42.220> be<00:06:42.460> able

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
the program is smart enough to be able

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.730 
the program is smart enough to be able
to<00:06:42.670> know<00:06:42.910> kind<00:06:43.270> of<00:06:43.420> what<00:06:43.630> we<00:06:43.750> want<00:06:44.080> in<00:06:44.320> those

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
to know kind of what we want in those

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:54.390 
to know kind of what we want in those
areas<00:06:50.070> that's<00:06:51.070> not<00:06:51.280> perfect<00:06:51.610> but<00:06:53.220> it<00:06:54.220> will

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
areas that's not perfect but it will

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.210 
areas that's not perfect but it will
work<00:06:55.050> for<00:06:56.050> what<00:06:56.200> we're<00:06:56.380> doing

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.650 

so<00:07:02.220> that's<00:07:02.670> looking<00:07:02.820> pretty<00:07:03.180> good<00:07:03.330> now<00:07:03.390> we

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
so that's looking pretty good now we

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.990 
so that's looking pretty good now we
have<00:07:03.840> our<00:07:03.960> high<00:07:04.140> resolution<00:07:04.760> panorama<00:07:05.870> and<00:07:08.000> we

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
have our high resolution panorama and we

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.550 
have our high resolution panorama and we
are<00:07:09.240> just<00:07:09.570> going<00:07:09.780> to<00:07:10.080> save<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.150> saves<00:07:12.150> as<00:07:18.560> and

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
are just going to save that saves as and

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.870 
are just going to save that saves as and
then<00:07:19.740> I'm<00:07:19.920> just<00:07:20.010> going<00:07:20.160> to<00:07:20.250> save<00:07:20.460> it<00:07:20.610> without

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
then I'm just going to save it without

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.530 
then I'm just going to save it without
the<00:07:21.030> layers<00:07:21.270> as<00:07:21.600> a<00:07:21.630> tiff<00:07:21.930> file<00:07:23.120> and<00:07:24.120> that's

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
the layers as a tiff file and that's

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.530 
the layers as a tiff file and that's
pretty<00:07:24.930> much<00:07:25.080> it<00:07:25.380> and<00:07:25.590> now<00:07:26.270> you<00:07:27.270> know<00:07:27.390> you're

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
pretty much it and now you know you're

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.180 
pretty much it and now you know you're
gonna<00:07:27.630> be<00:07:27.810> ready<00:07:28.020> to<00:07:28.230> do<00:07:28.350> any<00:07:28.620> other<00:07:28.830> edits

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
gonna be ready to do any other edits

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.150 
gonna be ready to do any other edits
that<00:07:29.400> you<00:07:29.460> want<00:07:29.670> to<00:07:29.760> make<00:07:29.940> but<00:07:31.010> this<00:07:32.010> is

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
that you want to make but this is

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.240 
that you want to make but this is
essentially<00:07:32.700> how<00:07:32.730> I<00:07:32.880> do<00:07:33.030> all<00:07:33.360> my

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250 
essentially how I do all my

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.470 
essentially how I do all my
astrophotography<00:07:35.250> panoramas<00:07:35.790> of<00:07:36.030> the<00:07:36.150> Milky

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.480 
astrophotography panoramas of the Milky

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.610 
astrophotography panoramas of the Milky
Way<00:07:36.590> you<00:07:37.590> know<00:07:37.710> the<00:07:37.920> same<00:07:38.160> application<00:07:39.620> works

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
Way you know the same application works

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.300 
Way you know the same application works
for<00:07:41.130> any<00:07:41.520> sunset<00:07:42.120> or<00:07:42.360> sunrise<00:07:42.620> or<00:07:43.620> pretty<00:07:44.280> much

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310
