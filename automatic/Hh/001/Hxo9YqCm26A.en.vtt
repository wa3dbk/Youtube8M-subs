he feels he's he's got a bit to prove
and<00:01:14.540> he<00:01:15.050> maybe<00:01:15.380> hasn't<00:01:15.680> had<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.100> tools<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:17.390> do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
that before and now with the new

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.720 
that before and now with the new
Kawasaki<00:01:20.620> he<00:01:21.620> is<00:01:21.770> feeling<00:01:22.100> confident<00:01:22.550> on<00:01:22.610> it

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
Kawasaki he is feeling confident on it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.000 
Kawasaki he is feeling confident on it
and<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.300> can<00:01:23.480> just<00:01:23.660> see<00:01:23.810> any<00:01:23.990> means<00:01:24.290> he's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
and you can just see any means he's

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.940 
and you can just see any means he's
excited<00:01:25.670> he's<00:01:25.820> he's<00:01:26.270> really<00:01:26.890> motivated<00:01:27.890> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
excited he's he's really motivated and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.860 
excited he's he's really motivated and
pumped<00:01:28.550> each<00:01:28.670> session<00:01:28.940> he<00:01:29.120> comes<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.780> he's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
pumped each session he comes in and he's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.590 
pumped each session he comes in and he's
bouncing<00:01:30.290> around<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:31.280> think<00:01:32.210> he<00:01:32.300> really

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
bouncing around and I think he really

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.990 
bouncing around and I think he really
wants<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.650> show<00:01:33.740> people<00:01:34.130> what<00:01:34.340> he<00:01:34.430> can<00:01:34.580> do<00:01:34.730> and
