00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello today we are going to learn the point 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.379
 bubble that we use for the saplings 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.780
 bubble dots make us this little ball 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.539
 which in this case is very nice for 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.930
 the Christmas trees is very easy 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:27.220
 to make the bubble we have to know 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.800
 to make the bubble is 5 varetas 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.500
 that close together look 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.829
 you start a bar and leave it in the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.829
 needle 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 you start another always at the same point 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 base two 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.650
 is that they close us is the last 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.460
 loop on the needle 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.460
 4 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.940
 5 Now you take a loop and you take out all 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 together the next point can be a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 half a point or a bar depends on what 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 that we are weaving what is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.250
 important is that you do not have it crossing 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.670
 the needle in front because you crush the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.300
 bubble then let's give it the form 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.600
 round and putting the needle in the back 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.820
 we make a half point in this case 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.729
 then the bubble is round and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.480
 with the tummy forward we make it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.460
 back we take wool 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.460
 a wand that closes us 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.579
 2 in the same base point 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.290
 3 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.570
 4 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.810
 5 we close all and now we make a 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.560
 half point 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.830
 putting the needle without crushing the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 bubble 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.940
 when you're doing the little trees look 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.230
 of expression that I am weaving now 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.540
 we do the same 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.540
 this is my next point 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.060
 a couple that does not close 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.720
 two 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 4 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.590
 to roland to iron all together I give the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.250
 way threw forwards and without 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.190
 crush it with the needle 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.760
 I make a half point then you see that 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 all the bubbles are redonditas 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.750
 perfect and beautiful
