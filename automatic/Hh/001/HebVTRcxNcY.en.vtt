00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.509 
into this I thought it would be a little
rage<00:00:13.019> inducing<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.679> thought<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.099> gonna<00:00:14.280> get

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
rage inducing I thought I was gonna get

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.160 
rage inducing I thought I was gonna get
pissed<00:00:14.880> off<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.420> was<00:00:15.540> gonna<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.960> too

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
pissed off that it was gonna be just too

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
pissed off that it was gonna be just too
hard<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.039> wasn't<00:00:17.310> gonna<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.699> any<00:00:17.910> gameplay

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
hard and I wasn't gonna get any gameplay

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960 
hard and I wasn't gonna get any gameplay
but<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.470> that's<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.490> happened<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
but that is that's not what happened it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.240 
but that is that's not what happened it
was<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.689> surprisingly<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.949> fun

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
was it was surprisingly a lot of fun

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.050 
was it was surprisingly a lot of fun
somehow<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.570> managed<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.279> awesome

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
somehow I managed to go on these awesome

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.099 
somehow I managed to go on these awesome
kill<00:00:27.269> streaks<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.900> killing

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
kill streaks where I'm just killing

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.140 
kill streaks where I'm just killing
people<00:00:28.140> left<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> right

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
people left and right

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.970 
people left and right
nailing<00:00:30.150> people<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.810> getting<00:00:31.230> body<00:00:31.590> shots

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
nailing people but getting body shots

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500 
nailing people but getting body shots
predicting<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:32.820> targets<00:00:33.239> were<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
predicting where targets were going to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.870 
predicting where targets were going to
be<00:00:33.600> heading<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.500> general<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.280> was<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
be heading and in general it was just a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
be heading and in general it was just a
really<00:00:36.270> exciting<00:00:36.840> experience

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
really exciting experience

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
really exciting experience
so<00:00:38.160> RPG<00:00:38.730> only<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.629> probably<00:00:39.870> predicted

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
so RPG only as you probably predicted

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
so RPG only as you probably predicted
has<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.700> challenges<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
has some challenges to it and one of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
has some challenges to it and one of
those<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.710> many<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
those as many of you know is that it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.380 
those as many of you know is that it
doesn't<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.379> fast<00:00:47.390> projectile

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
doesn't have a very fast projectile

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
doesn't have a very fast projectile
speed<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.840> every<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.739> try<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> line

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
speed so every time that you try to line

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400 
speed so every time that you try to line
up<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> shot<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.879> anything<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.600> medium<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> long

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
up a shot for anything at medium to long

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
up a shot for anything at medium to long
range<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
range even if that is even if that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
range even if that is even if that
target<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> gigantic<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.070> enemy<00:00:56.370> vehicle

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
target is gigantic like an enemy vehicle

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.869 
target is gigantic like an enemy vehicle
it<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.899> difficult<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> hit<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.760> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it can be difficult to hit it because if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
it can be difficult to hit it because if
they<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.210> moving<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.320> change

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
they are moving or if they just change

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.189 
they are moving or if they just change
direction<00:01:02.270> predicting<00:01:03.270> where<00:01:03.600> they're<00:01:03.870> going

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
direction predicting where they're going

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
direction predicting where they're going
and<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.830> make<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.070> slight<00:01:05.760> change<00:01:06.150> in

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and if they make that slight change in

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
and if they make that slight change in
direction<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.130> difference

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
direction can mean the difference

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.580 
direction can mean the difference
between<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.630> hitmarker<00:01:09.990> or<00:01:10.320> just

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
between you getting a hitmarker or just

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.179 
between you getting a hitmarker or just
flat-out<00:01:11.040> missing<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.750> that's

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
flat-out missing and it was that's

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
flat-out missing and it was that's
challenging<00:01:14.189> aspect<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.030> which<00:01:15.509> made<00:01:15.869> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
challenging aspect of it which made this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
challenging aspect of it which made this
challenge<00:01:17.400> pretty<00:01:17.880> much<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.509> completely<00:01:19.320> all

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
challenge pretty much not completely all

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
challenge pretty much not completely all
luck<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.729> almost<00:01:21.000> every<00:01:21.270> time<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> went<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
luck but almost every time I went for a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
luck but almost every time I went for a
shot<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.799> were<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> medium<00:01:23.460> distance

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
shot and they were at a medium distance

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
shot and they were at a medium distance
I<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> toss-up<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I it was a toss-up I was like well this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.569 
I it was a toss-up I was like well this
might<00:01:26.729> hit<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
might hit but I'm not gonna it's not a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
might hit but I'm not gonna it's not a
guarantee<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> things<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
guarantee and one of the things that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
guarantee and one of the things that
made<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> even<00:01:32.250> harder<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.630> did

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
made it even harder is that if I did

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
made it even harder is that if I did
want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> kill<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.680> someone<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
want to get a kill on someone I had to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
want to get a kill on someone I had to
aim<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> body<00:01:37.140> shot

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
aim for a body shot

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.550 
aim for a body shot
the<00:01:38.040> RPG<00:01:38.520> doesn't<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.659> damage<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the RPG doesn't do a lot of damage or a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
the RPG doesn't do a lot of damage or a
lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> splash<00:01:41.189> damage<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.729> every<00:01:41.970> time<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lot of splash damage so every time I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030 
lot of splash damage so every time I
would<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> hitmarker

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
would get a hitmarker

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
would get a hitmarker
or<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.610> every<00:01:44.820> time<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.540> close<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.259> getting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
or if every time I was close to getting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
or if every time I was close to getting
the<00:01:46.590> kill<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.310> hit<00:01:47.460> marker<00:01:47.790> they

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the kill I would get the hit marker they

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.429 
the kill I would get the hit marker they
would<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> then

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
would know I was there and then

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
would know I was there and then
proceeded<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.490> course<00:01:50.700> kill<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.060> because

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
proceeded to of course kill me because

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
proceeded to of course kill me because
it<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.720> has<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.350> long<00:01:52.680> reload<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.670> like

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it also has a very long reload time like

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
it also has a very long reload time like
I<00:01:53.970> said<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.869> things<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I said there's a lot of things that it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
I said there's a lot of things that it
makes<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.159> challenge<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.030> difficult<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
makes this challenge so difficult and so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
makes this challenge so difficult and so
pretty<00:01:58.500> much<00:01:58.619> every<00:01:59.009> single<00:01:59.219> time<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.729> went<00:01:59.909> for

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pretty much every single time I went for

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
pretty much every single time I went for
a<00:02:00.119> shot<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.509> always<00:02:00.960> needed<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.320> line<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
a shot I always needed to line it up I

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.490 
a shot I always needed to line it up I
always<00:02:02.189> needed<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> make<00:02:02.790> sure<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.570> my<00:02:03.869> RPG

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
always needed to make sure that my RPG

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.160 
always needed to make sure that my RPG
shot<00:02:04.790> with<00:02:05.790> their<00:02:06.000> current<00:02:06.299> projection<00:02:06.780> was

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
shot with their current projection was

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.570 
shot with their current projection was
going<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.530> give<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> buy<00:02:07.979> shot<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.429> would

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
going to give me the buy shot I would

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.570 
going to give me the buy shot I would
never<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.179> try<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.229> kind<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
never really try to go for kind of a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.710 
never really try to go for kind of a
splash<00:02:12.090> damage<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.629> someone<00:02:12.900> because<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> knew

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
splash damage on someone because I knew

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
splash damage on someone because I knew
it<00:02:13.810> wasn't<00:02:14.230> gonna<00:02:14.320> give<00:02:14.530> me<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> kill<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.640> not

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it wasn't gonna give me the kill and not

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.510 
it wasn't gonna give me the kill and not
only<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.630> as<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.990> mentioned<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.650> RPG<00:02:18.250> has

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
only that but as I mentioned the RPG has

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.780 
only that but as I mentioned the RPG has
a<00:02:18.580> very<00:02:18.970> slow<00:02:19.420> reload<00:02:20.320> time<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.860> at<00:02:21.160> first<00:02:21.460> I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a very slow reload time and at first I

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.190 
a very slow reload time and at first I
thought<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.330> would<00:02:22.540> get<00:02:22.630> me<00:02:22.780> killed<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
thought that this would get me killed a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.110 
thought that this would get me killed a
lot<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.740> did<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.460> there<00:02:24.670> were<00:02:24.820> some

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
lot and it did but there were some

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.420 
lot and it did but there were some
moments<00:02:25.270> where<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.750> was<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.290> these<00:02:26.590> firefights

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
moments where I was in these firefights

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.730 
moments where I was in these firefights
with<00:02:27.550> people<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.810> was<00:02:28.930> in<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.440> was<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
with people and it was in the it was it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.080 
with people and it was in the it was it
was<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.010> middle<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.400> match<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:30.970> they

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
was in the middle of a match and so they

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.120 
was in the middle of a match and so they
knew<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.750> thought<00:02:32.080> they<00:02:32.260> knew<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:32.980> was

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
knew that I thought they knew that I was

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.670 
knew that I thought they knew that I was
going<00:02:33.280> RPG<00:02:33.970> only<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.840> every<00:02:35.110> single<00:02:35.290> time<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
going RPG only but every single time I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.010 
going RPG only but every single time I
would<00:02:36.040> miss<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.640> know<00:02:36.760> they<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.330> continued

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to try to pick me off from a distance

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.700 
to try to pick me off from a distance
they<00:02:40.180> wouldn't<00:02:40.390> try<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.540> close<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.930> gap<00:02:41.110> they

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
they wouldn't try to close the gap they

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.050 
they wouldn't try to close the gap they
wouldn't<00:02:42.010> try<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.250> kind<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:42.910> go

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
wouldn't try to kind of just go

wouldn't try to kind of just go
aggressive<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.050> was<00:02:44.200> reloading<00:02:44.590> behind

but<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.390> still<00:03:13.630> found<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.020> really<00:03:14.680> amusing<00:03:15.370> at

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
but I still found it really amusing at

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.310 
but I still found it really amusing at
that<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.700> got<00:03:16.209> all<00:03:16.390> these<00:03:16.510> kills<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.110> I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
that I got all these kills that I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.800 
that I got all these kills that I
shouldn't<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:18.040> simply<00:03:18.550> because<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.690> know

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
shouldn't have simply because you know

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
they should have taken advantage of the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.300 
they should have taken advantage of the
slow<00:03:21.940> reload<00:03:22.360> time<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.440> general<00:03:23.980> the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
slow reload time but in general the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.949 
slow reload time but in general the
