00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 and elasticized lace this so that for 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.710
 that would suit us and obviously we 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.170
 between without having to put it close like this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 how good I am going to explain to you how is it 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 it's done because it's the easiest way 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.220
 obviously starting from a dress 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.890
 basic I here I already have previously 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 cut what would be my forward and my 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.529
 back what we're going to do is cut 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.599
 also in lining because we are going to sew 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 obviously it's something that is transparent 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.610
 so you need your lining but this time 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.130
 We are going to sew the lining together with the fabric 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 that we're going to have this opposite why 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.170
 because you know that for example in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 the poster is that it rains choosing is more 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.040
 open and the seam is surely going to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 see if we get it separately to the lining 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.520
 so let's sew with straight 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.700
 the two pieces the lining and what would be 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.129
 we 're going to sew you all the 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.920
 contour doing it as if it were a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 fabric nothing else that's going to be since we've 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 known let's join by shoulders and we 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.220
 will be girls this way no longer 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 I have here as you can see already what 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.080
 we join the shoulders in the back in the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 back and no super long neckline because 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.940
 because it is a lace wave so that it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.789
 see more elegant and as you can see already 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.770
 I have here united with straight we are going to 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.229
 stick the sleeves on the sleeves 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.690
 I recommend that they leave it unlined 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 give that touch that the dress has and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.960
 make the lace look and I have it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.229
 here already cropped 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.580
 and as you know we're going to hit it open 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.240
 that's why it's not closed 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.369
 costs this for saving us like the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.220
 quibbles that I'm trampled on 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.100
 manga or you know that good to all of us 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.130
 it happens but I give them this type because 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.670
 it's the simplest thing in the world they're going to sew 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 by all the whole sisa ok layers that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.280
 I'll be with some folds not good 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.420
 once we cross the whole sleeve 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.100
 two sleeves we will stay like this I am 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 putting so they can see by the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.410
 back part what is the neckline and the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.650
 manga I did not put the liner on them 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.620
 I commented to make it look very sexy 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.780
 Now I kind of like the neckline of what you 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.030
 I missed a little bit and what I did to make 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.970
 good if you have to bunk something that does not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.170
 see his back I made a bow with a 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.580
 rectangle like this 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.709
 simple rectangle and also the run 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.830
 so that it gives a little more body to 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.349
 what would be our bun we are going to sew 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.530
 around the contour and the middle we are going to 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.600
 leave an opening without sewing this to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.190
 flip it 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.500
 very very fast 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.830
 you had to shake it because if you do not 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.560
 seams do not come out because I have here in 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.340
 the rectangle and to stop it I did 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 a run that obviously you are going to 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.740
 flip in little houses and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.810
 tightening the strip the bow is formed 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.390
 bun we will be 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:16.380
 in this way ok the only thing that we have left 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.990
 to do is put the bow where it would be 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.460
 the part with our neckline or if they want 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.830
 play can put it on the shoulder and it 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.250
 will look amazing once they have 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 I decide where to put your sexy bun we are going to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.990
 have the finished obviously we are going to 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.740
 give 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.580
 a hem on what would be the neckline 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.050
 and what would be the hem and the sleeves in 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.240
 what I want you to see is that the sleeves 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.970
 of what father you see that is the effect 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.310
 that we want to create a very sexy effect 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.800
 because it teaches the skin but it does not teach 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.020
 a lot then this is the secret that 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.840
 men love them so I love them 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.630
 I say use a high neckline and nothing 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.530
 world I will wear when I wear a neckline 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.480
 something very closed back talking and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.220
 if they open it, do not open it forward because 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.980
 that is what he will give as the little touch 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.630
 sexy so good I recommend that you 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.160
 are this dress and are going to do in the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.160
 night a total impact girls
