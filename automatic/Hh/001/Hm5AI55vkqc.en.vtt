that you won't be able to get any mesh

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
that you won't be able to get any mesh
in<00:01:02.399> between<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.879> fingers<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.899> reason<00:01:04.170> why

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
there's just simply no room for any mesh

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
there's just simply no room for any mesh
to<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.830> added<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> between<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.700> fingers<00:01:11.850> and

protection<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> lot<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:25.619> difficult

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
protection can be a lot more difficult

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.789 
protection can be a lot more difficult
to<00:01:26.189> find<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> next<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
to find so next we're going to be

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
to find so next we're going to be
looking<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> negative<00:01:29.670> cut<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
looking at the negative cut are the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
looking at the negative cut are the
fingers<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> negative<00:01:31.229> cut<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.799> more

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
fingers of a negative cut are more

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
fingers of a negative cut are more
individually<00:01:32.790> spaced<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.630> thin<00:01:34.020> now

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
individually spaced out and thin now

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.749 
individually spaced out and thin now
this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.189> good<00:01:35.369> benefit<00:01:35.729> for

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this is a really good benefit for

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is a really good benefit for
keepers<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.479> narrower<00:01:37.110> fingers<00:01:37.680> because

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
keepers with narrower fingers because

this<00:01:40.590> type<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.950> cut<00:01:41.340> should<00:01:41.759> still<00:01:42.030> provide<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this type of cut should still provide a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
this type of cut should still provide a
lot<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> comfort<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.560> tight<00:01:43.979> fear<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
lot of comfort and tight fear which a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
lot of comfort and tight fear which a
lot<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> glove<00:01:45.509> cuts<00:01:45.810> normally<00:01:46.380> don't<00:01:46.560> offer

for their narrower fingered goalkeepers

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.469 
for their narrower fingered goalkeepers
because<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> fingers<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.149> thin

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
because of the fingers are more thin

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
because of the fingers are more thin
this<00:01:52.079> means<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.799> less<00:01:52.920> latex<00:01:53.790> for

this means that there is less latex for

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.730 
this means that there is less latex for
the<00:01:54.090> ball<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> land<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> Roll<00:01:55.380> finger

cut but a negative cut does offer a lot

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.639 
cut but a negative cut does offer a lot
of<00:01:58.890> finger<00:01:59.250> flexion<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.450> means<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.350> lot

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of finger flexion this means a is a lot

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350

the reason why some people call this cut
the<00:02:23.430> Box<00:02:23.670> cut<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.960> fingers<00:02:25.350> they

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the Box cut is because the fingers they

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.560 
the Box cut is because the fingers they
look<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.890> lot<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.400> boxing<00:02:26.910> rectangular

the outside of the glove because of this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.080 
the outside of the glove because of this

the flat palm can be quite loose-fitting
so<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.930> recommended<00:02:37.620> recommended<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.640> maybe

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
so it's recommended recommended to maybe

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.180 
so it's recommended recommended to maybe
go<00:02:39.120> about<00:02:39.360> half<00:02:39.750> an<00:02:39.959> inch<00:02:40.110> smaller<00:02:40.590> when

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
go about half an inch smaller when

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
buying new pairs of gloves with this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.040 
buying new pairs of gloves with this
type<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:42.990> cut<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:44.060> great<00:02:45.060> benefit<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> flat

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
type of cut a great benefit of the flat

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.260 
type of cut a great benefit of the flat
palm<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.010> there's<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> ton<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.910> room<00:02:48.209> for

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
palm is that there's a ton of room for

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.810 
palm is that there's a ton of room for
mesh<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.840> between<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> fingers<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.580> type

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
mesh in between the fingers so this type

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.640 
mesh in between the fingers so this type
of<00:02:50.850> cut<00:02:51.240> would<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.690> perfect<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.350> goalkeepers
