really do like this game you know I
agree<00:01:47.539> with<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.020> more<00:01:48.740> times<00:01:49.039> than<00:01:49.249> not

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
agree with you and more times than not

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.190 
agree with you and more times than not
you<00:01:49.490> could<00:01:49.909> look<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.270> team's<00:01:50.539> turnover

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you could look at a team's turnover

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.849 
you could look at a team's turnover
ratio<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:52.329> pretty<00:01:53.329> much<00:01:53.420> figure<00:01:54.409> out<00:01:54.590> what

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
ratio and pretty much figure out what

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.099 
ratio and pretty much figure out what
they<00:01:55.009> are<00:01:55.039> 80s<00:01:55.700> that<00:01:55.999> year<00:01:56.270> whether<00:01:56.749> they<00:01:56.960> had

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
they are 80s that year whether they had

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.069 
they are 80s that year whether they had
a<00:01:57.139> winning<00:01:57.439> 80s<00:01:58.039> or<00:01:58.219> losing<00:01:58.670> 80s<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.960> a

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
a winning 80s or losing 80s and that's a

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.700 
a winning 80s or losing 80s and that's a
great<00:02:00.289> point<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:01.219> Duke<00:02:01.670> even<00:02:02.119> though<00:02:02.710> losing

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
great point that Duke even though losing

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.370 
great point that Duke even though losing
turnover<00:02:04.460> battles<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.119> still<00:02:05.569> covering<00:02:05.990> games

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
turnover battles is still covering games

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.889 
turnover battles is still covering games
that<00:02:06.920> tells<00:02:07.219> you<00:02:07.429> they're<00:02:07.939> undervalued<00:02:08.690> you

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
that tells you they're undervalued you

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.050 
that tells you they're undervalued you
know<00:02:09.019> I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:09.799> they're<00:02:10.129> undervalued<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:10.849> this

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
know I think they're undervalued in this

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.020 
know I think they're undervalued in this
spot<00:02:11.299> as<00:02:11.540> well<00:02:12.010> here's<00:02:13.010> why<00:02:13.159> I<00:02:13.190> think<00:02:13.280> do<00:02:13.819> could

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
spot as well here's why I think do could

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.670 
spot as well here's why I think do could
hang<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.390> there

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
hang in there

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.470 
hang in there
their<00:02:15.680> weakness<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.400> running<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.940> ball<00:02:17.120> you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
their weakness is running the ball you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.510 
their weakness is running the ball you
know<00:02:17.630> if<00:02:17.870> they<00:02:18.380> become<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.980> dimensional

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
know if they become one dimensional

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.220 
know if they become one dimensional
because<00:02:19.790> they<00:02:19.910> pass<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.450> ball<00:02:20.600> they're<00:02:20.750> 28th

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
because they pass the ball they're 28th

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.650 
because they pass the ball they're 28th
in<00:02:21.440> all<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.950> college<00:02:22.130> football<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.880> passing

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
in rushing yards if a good team you know

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.320 
in rushing yards if a good team you know
a<00:02:28.910> powerhouse<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:30.890> shut<00:02:31.790> down<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
a powerhouse could really shut down so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.720 
a powerhouse could really shut down so
they<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.540> no<00:02:32.570> running<00:02:33.290> game<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:34.490> some

they have no running game and for some

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.690 
they have no running game and for some
the<00:02:34.760> only<00:02:35.390> pass<00:02:35.960> they<00:02:36.800> become<00:02:37.130> extremely

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the only pass they become extremely

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.790 
the only pass they become extremely
beatable<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.660> know<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:38.960> not<00:02:39.140> hard<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.500> game

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
beatable you know it's not hard to game

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.360 
beatable you know it's not hard to game
plan<00:02:39.830> against<00:02:40.580> them<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.540> Miami<00:02:41.990> is<00:02:42.380> weak

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
plan against them but Miami is weak

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.190 
plan against them but Miami is weak
against<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.940> run<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.480> mean<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.050> have<00:02:45.170> a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
against the run I mean you have a

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.480 
against the run I mean you have a
defense<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.630> 82nd<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:48.160> rushing<00:02:49.160> yards

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
defense that's 82nd in rushing yards

defense that's 82nd in rushing yards
allowed<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:50.540> tells<00:02:50.840> me<00:02:50.960> Dukes<00:02:51.470> going<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
allowed that tells me Dukes going to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.650 
allowed that tells me Dukes going to
have<00:02:51.890> some<00:02:52.190> success<00:02:52.460> running<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.240> ball<00:02:53.450> if

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
have some success running the ball if

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.110 
have some success running the ball if
anything<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.220> one<00:02:55.400> week<00:02:55.640> where<00:02:55.940> they

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
anything this is the one week where they

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.260 
anything this is the one week where they
may<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.480> able<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.650> run<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> little<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.940> make<00:02:59.060> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
may be able to run a little to make the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.200 
may be able to run a little to make the
passing<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.990> lot<00:03:00.260> easier<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.770> them<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.400> like<00:03:02.090> I

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
passing a lot easier for them and like I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.420 
passing a lot easier for them and like I
said<00:03:02.270> they<00:03:02.660> already<00:03:03.020> have<00:03:03.380> success<00:03:03.920> throwing

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
said they already have success throwing

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.820 
said they already have success throwing
the<00:03:04.550> ball<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.480> give<00:03:05.720> me<00:03:05.930> Duke<00:03:06.260> with<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:06.680> those

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
the ball you give me Duke with all those

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.460 
the ball you give me Duke with all those
points<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.790> game<00:03:07.820> where<00:03:08.690> their<00:03:08.840> offense<00:03:09.350> is

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
points in a game where their offense is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.920 
points in a game where their offense is
going<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.710> be<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.800> lot<00:03:10.100> more<00:03:10.130> balanced<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.360> I

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
going to be a lot more balanced and I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.870 
going to be a lot more balanced and I
think<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.350> great<00:03:12.500> spot<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.010> back<00:03:13.400> them<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
think it's a great spot to back them and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.790 
think it's a great spot to back them and
then<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.510> brought<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.930> motivational

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
then you brought up the motivational

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.670 
then you brought up the motivational
factor<00:03:16.340> Miami's<00:03:17.120> looking<00:03:17.510> ahead<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:18.560> know

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
factor Miami's looking ahead you know

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.100 
factor Miami's looking ahead you know
they<00:03:19.459> got<00:03:19.640> two<00:03:19.880> big<00:03:20.060> games<00:03:20.300> coming<00:03:20.660> up<00:03:20.930> and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
they got two big games coming up and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.260 
they got two big games coming up and
Duke<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.160> cupcake<00:03:22.640> on<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.970> schedule

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
Duke is the cupcake on the schedule

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.810 
Duke is the cupcake on the schedule
nobody<00:03:23.810> circled<00:03:24.350> Duke<00:03:24.620> had<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.280> begin<00:03:25.430> into

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
nobody circled Duke had to begin into

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.900 
nobody circled Duke had to begin into
season<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:27.110> think<00:03:27.680> Miami<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.640> all<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
season I think Miami with all the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.730 
season I think Miami with all the
problems<00:03:29.330> they<00:03:29.450> had<00:03:29.660> coming<00:03:29.990> into<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.470> season

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
problems they had coming into the season

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.790 
problems they had coming into the season
the<00:03:31.180> only<00:03:32.180> time<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.450> look<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.110> back<00:03:33.380> them<00:03:33.620> is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the only time you look the back them is

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.130 
the only time you look the back them is
when<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:35.270> know<00:03:35.480> you're<00:03:35.660> going<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:35.990> up

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
when you know you're going to get up

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.980 
when you know you're going to get up

them you know I back them i believe it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.510 
them you know I back them i believe it
was<00:03:41.690> against<00:03:42.080> Georgia<00:03:42.380> Tech<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.860> thought<00:03:43.370> it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
was against Georgia Tech I thought it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.130 
was against Georgia Tech I thought it
was<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.640> good<00:03:43.910> spot<00:03:44.239> for<00:03:44.300> them<00:03:44.600> they<00:03:44.720> they<00:03:45.080> were

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
was a good spot for them they they were

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.280 
was a good spot for them they they were
motivated<00:03:46.010> team<00:03:46.220> playing<00:03:46.580> at<00:03:46.790> home<00:03:46.970> here's<00:03:47.290> a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
motivated team playing at home here's a

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.229 
motivated team playing at home here's a
spot<00:03:48.620> where<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.070> don't<00:03:49.550> think<00:03:49.880> I'm<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.180> to

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
spot where I don't think I'm going to

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.660 
spot where I don't think I'm going to
see<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.450> motivate<00:03:50.959> Miami<00:03:51.380> team<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.920> they're

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
see a motivate Miami team and they're

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.820 
see a motivate Miami team and they're
just<00:03:52.940> not<00:03:53.209> good<00:03:53.600> enough<00:03:53.630> they've<00:03:54.560> not

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
just not good enough they've not

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.390 
just not good enough they've not
talented<00:03:55.580> enough<00:03:55.700> yet<00:03:56.620> or<00:03:57.620> mature<00:03:58.070> enough<00:03:58.340> yet

talented enough yet or mature enough yet

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.760 
talented enough yet or mature enough yet
to<00:03:58.910> be<00:03:59.360> able<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.840> cover<00:04:00.080> these<00:04:00.320> kind<00:04:00.680> of

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
to be able to cover these kind of

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.640 
to be able to cover these kind of
numbers<00:04:00.950> without<00:04:01.660> putting<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:02.930> kind<00:04:03.500> of

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
numbers without putting out that kind of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.160 
numbers without putting out that kind of
like<00:04:03.830> full<00:04:04.190> effort<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.480> think<00:04:05.720> do<00:04:05.930> could

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
like full effort and I think do could

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.890 
like full effort and I think do could
hang<00:04:06.350> around<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.100> create<00:04:07.850> some<00:04:08.180> problems<00:04:08.209> and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
hang around and create some problems and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.530 
hang around and create some problems and
with<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.230> passing<00:04:09.800> game<00:04:09.980> like<00:04:10.250> Dukes<00:04:10.580> that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
with a passing game like Dukes that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.229 
with a passing game like Dukes that
backdoor<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.260> going<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.470> be<00:04:12.590> wide<00:04:12.830> open

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
backdoor is going to be wide open

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.780 
backdoor is going to be wide open
throughout<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.480> game<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.920> Duke<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.549> I'll

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
throughout the game I like Duke and I'll

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.090 
throughout the game I like Duke and I'll
go<00:04:16.970> step<00:04:17.270> further<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.810> like<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.290> over<00:04:18.830> in<00:04:18.950> this

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
go step further I like the over in this

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.789 
go step further I like the over in this
game<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.669> think<00:04:20.239> Duke<00:04:20.480> does<00:04:20.720> some<00:04:20.959> scoring<00:04:21.470> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
game I think Duke does some scoring and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.890 
game I think Duke does some scoring and
obviously<00:04:22.550> Miami's<00:04:23.090> going<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.300> do<00:04:23.419> their

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
obviously Miami's going to do their

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.159 
obviously Miami's going to do their
scoring<00:04:24.410> as<00:04:24.650> well<00:04:24.979> I<00:04:25.220> could<00:04:26.150> see<00:04:26.419> both<00:04:26.750> teams

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
scoring as well I could see both teams

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.540 
scoring as well I could see both teams
getting<00:04:27.919> you<00:04:28.310> know

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
getting you know

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.230 
getting you know
over<00:04:29.270> 28<00:04:29.750> points<00:04:30.110> both<00:04:30.290> cracking<00:04:30.710> 30<00:04:31.250> if

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
over 28 points both cracking 30 if

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.450 
over 28 points both cracking 30 if
that's<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.750> case<00:04:32.930> we<00:04:33.380> got<00:04:33.530> an<00:04:33.680> over<00:04:34.040> in

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
that's the case we got an over in

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.760 
that's the case we got an over in
ocassion<00:04:35.150> as<00:04:35.300> well<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.720> agree<00:04:36.230> with<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.410> Brian

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
ocassion as well I agree with you Brian

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.230 
ocassion as well I agree with you Brian
you<00:04:36.980> don't<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> talk<00:04:37.490> me<00:04:37.700> into<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:38.060> I

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
you don't have to talk me into it I

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.870 
you don't have to talk me into it I
really<00:04:38.990> like<00:04:39.200> what<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.920> said<00:04:40.070> about<00:04:40.190> Duke<00:04:40.610> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
really like what you said about Duke and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.900 
really like what you said about Duke and
like<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.840> said<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.140> leaned<00:04:42.770> over<00:04:42.800> as<00:04:43.280> well<00:04:43.460> Duke

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
like I said I leaned over as well Duke

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.360 
like I said I leaned over as well Duke
being<00:04:44.420> one<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.780> six<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.350> one<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.710> be<00:04:45.830> under<00:04:46.190> I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
being one in six and one to be under I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.150 
being one in six and one to be under I
think<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.300> get<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.480> little<00:04:47.570> value<00:04:47.930> on<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.680> total

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
think we get a little value on the total

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.580 
think we get a little value on the total
and<00:04:49.370> when<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.450> look<00:04:50.600> at<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> scores<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.380> last

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
and when you look at the scores the last

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.240 
and when you look at the scores the last
you<00:04:51.920> know<00:04:51.950> two<00:04:52.100> years<00:04:52.900> we<00:04:53.900> saw<00:04:54.200> games<00:04:54.530> go<00:04:54.770> under

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
you know two years we saw games go under

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.160 
you know two years we saw games go under
with<00:04:55.430> these<00:04:55.640> two<00:04:55.850> but<00:04:56.090> yet<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.480> total<00:04:56.870> still

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
with these two but yet the total still

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.070 
with these two but yet the total still
coming<00:04:57.500> out<00:04:57.590> high<00:04:57.830> in<00:04:58.130> 2009<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.150> was<00:04:59.360> 56<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.050> a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
coming out high in 2009 I was 56 and a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.340 
coming out high in 2009 I was 56 and a
half<00:05:00.230> they<00:05:00.410> scored<00:05:00.710> 50<00:05:01.070> points<00:05:02.080> 2010<00:05:03.080> last

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
half they scored 50 points 2010 last

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.640 
half they scored 50 points 2010 last
year<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:04.220> total<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:04.610> 57<00:05:05.420> they<00:05:05.870> only<00:05:05.990> put<00:05:06.230> up<00:05:06.260> 41

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
year the total is 57 they only put up 41

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.410 
year the total is 57 they only put up 41
points<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.490> yet<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.120> they<00:05:08.150> are<00:05:08.270> again

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
points and yet here they are again

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.110 
points and yet here they are again
thrown<00:05:09.080> out<00:05:09.230> a<00:05:09.290> total<00:05:09.740> 55<00:05:10.310> where<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.790> opened

thrown out a total 55 where it opened
that<00:05:11.290> 56<00:05:12.290> now<00:05:12.650> looks<00:05:13.340> like<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.520> little<00:05:13.760> short

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
that 56 now looks like a little short

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
think i might tell us in a parley on

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.980 
think i might tell us in a parley on
this<00:05:20.600> one<00:05:20.810> can<00:05:21.350> argue<00:05:21.380> with<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:22.180> Duke<00:05:23.180> Duke

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
this one can argue with that Duke Duke

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.980 
this one can argue with that Duke Duke
