 youtube are welcome to a new 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.960
 video in which this time I come 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.020
 with a gabon friend or people who want 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 the constant we will record a pack of 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.910
 mods for the version of minecraft 7.10 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.710
 that will consist of two parts that's how 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.060
 he said it will consist of two parts the 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.590
 which will each be in your channel 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 point 10 the most current which does not enter 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.940
 we two work so that this 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.920
 pack of mods had no problems 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.290
 so you do not have problems and so 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 you do not have any error when opening it and 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 everyone left their own how 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 do it correctly already so that it does not 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.060
 make some mistake and well, this 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.120
 pack contains two bikes are the ones that 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.590
 are used on the one hand would be everything and 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.360
 I would leave them with my previous one more 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.550

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.710
 the installation of the mods folder 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 as we see in this world I do not have 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.240
 and good what we have to do first 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.090
 is to go to the percent app folder 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.579

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.890
 point 10 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.870

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 configurations 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.620

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.380
