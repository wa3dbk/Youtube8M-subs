 in the subject that can give you the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 good solution doctor first of all 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 let's count the people who are us 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 seeing what is the facial flushing and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 that is generated by facial redness 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 it's a condition that people have 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.540
 in which the face turns red 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.970
 sudden way that is also known as 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.880
 facial flushing or facial flushing or 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.920
 Facial flushing is a condition 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.320
 functional simply is not properly 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.240
 a disease but it is a condition 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.880
 functional that greatly limits the life of 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.050
 people both in the workplace and in 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.790
 the social 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.119
 this facial flushing is 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.470
 characterized by being sudden to be 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.810
 triggered by minimal stimuli 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
 minimum stimuli such as meeting 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.090
 a person so way 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.189
 sudden or greet another person or 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.000
 they are simply those people who 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.700
 generate 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.190
 phobia or difficulty speaking in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.050
 public because that stimulus blushes 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.630
 that is what is known as the 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.300
 Facial flushing is a condition 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 as I say it is not a disease but 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 it is a problem that affects daily life 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 of many people which is the best 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.750
 treatment against redness 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.720
 facial the most effective is really a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.780
 surgery called sympathectomy 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.869
 Thoracoscopic is the most effective 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.000
 treatment based on medications has 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.420
 really shown very little 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.259
 support effective treatments 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.360
 Psychological and psychiatric support 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.330
 they have also shown very low 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.229
 Effectiveness instead sympathectomy 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.140
 if it is highly effective it is 95 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.470
 effective percentage in the control of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 Symptom of redness of the face very 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.040
 well doctor after performing this 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.360
 surgery what are the effects 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.170
 side effects that the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.049
 patients the only side effect that 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.160
 really has the surgery is to produce 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:29.010
 a derivation of sweat to the site 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.970
 different to the face as well as the trunk 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 the back the legs is to say 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.049
 redistributes sweat production 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.380
 because the same nerve that produces the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.120
 redness is a nerve that drives 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.540
 the stimuli for the production of 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.569
 sweat then some interrupt those 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.450
 stimuli to the face the organism 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.849
 let's say it reacts in a way that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.430
 drift sweat to other parts of the body 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.920
 it is possible to pronounce normally 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.409
 after the procedure then really 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.499
 the skin of the person has no problems 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.859
 one does not do anything in the face this surgery 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:09.920
 it is done all in the thorax then there is no 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.989
 no limitation for exposure 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.219
 solar what are the probabilities of 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.230
 that the people who have been made 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.379
 this surgery against redness 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.689
 facial come back to suffer, let's say 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.000
 there is no treatment in medicine 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.519
 which is one hundred percent effective yes 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.010
 Of course there is a very small percentage of 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.500
 people who may have recurrence the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.310
 problem the recurrence is pretty much 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.919
 in 5% of people the invitation 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.840
 is for those people who have 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.810
 problems of facial flushing or 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.549
