00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.480
 Alexander Levitas and business coach 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460

 and answer the question how to become 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.759
 successful or how to be successful in these 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.910
 there is such a Jewish joke about 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.739
 the person who bought the concert tickets 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 in albert hall one of the most famous 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 concert sad world but he is the first 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 collection 1 doesn't know how to go there and 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.250
 stop an elderly Jewish man in the street 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 woman close just how to get into 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 albert hall 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.360
 she gives a young man is not just 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.809
 it is necessary to practice practicing and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.090
 practice again that is how 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.719
 to succeed at first you need to understand 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.240
 What is success for you because it 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.689
 that I consider it a success, I am not at all what you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.429
 want such success for yourself sometimes 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 it may seem that any success is 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.319
 ok but think about success for example 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.729
 olympic champion 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.950
 how many times did he go to the hospital 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.289
 how many times he broke bones tore ligaments 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 to get your gold medal not 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.990
 the fact that you walk this for yourself 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.240
 so you need to decide what success is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.459
 I want to achieve exactly what you want 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 to achieve 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:38.729
 then you need to find someone who knows the way 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.880
 to this success someone who is already there either 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.289
 have already led other people there if I 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.310
 I want to be a boxing world champion 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.020
 then either I'll try to find a world champion 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 forest world boxing champion who already 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.999
 knows to be cast as a champion either i 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.010
 I will try to find a coach whose students 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.340

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.370

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.260
