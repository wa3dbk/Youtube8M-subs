one of the hardest things to prayer is

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.870 
one of the hardest things to prayer is
oil<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.509> fat<00:00:12.809> if<00:00:13.769> that's<00:00:14.009> very<00:00:14.250> important<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
oil or fat if that's very important the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.720 
oil or fat if that's very important the
diet<00:00:16.940> because<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.619> produces<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> high<00:00:20.189> amount

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
diet because it produces a high amount

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.700 
diet because it produces a high amount
of<00:00:20.880> calories<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:22.140> also<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.470> you're<00:00:22.590> gonna

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
of calories and also if you're gonna

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.500 
of calories and also if you're gonna
cook<00:00:22.980> especially<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.850> cooking<00:00:24.029> them

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
cook especially if you're cooking them

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
cook especially if you're cooking them
out<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> bush<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:25.859> something<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.250> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
out of the bush or something like that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609 
out of the bush or something like that
and<00:00:26.550> using<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> fire<00:00:27.180> you'll<00:00:27.990> find<00:00:28.289> you'll<00:00:28.470> want

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and using a fire you'll find you'll want

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
and using a fire you'll find you'll want
some<00:00:28.800> oil<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.310> some<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.060> easy<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
some oil or some think it's very easy to

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.840 
some oil or some think it's very easy to
fry<00:00:30.840> something<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:32.160> hard<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> cook

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
fry something a bit hard just to cook

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.110 
fry something a bit hard just to cook
things<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.870> pan<00:00:34.790> without<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> little

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
things in that in a pan without a little

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
things in that in a pan without a little
bit<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.300> oil<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.190> important<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
bit of oil in it so it's important to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.350 
bit of oil in it so it's important to
have<00:00:41.820> oil

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
have oil

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.020 
have oil
the<00:00:42.719> problem<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.610> oils<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> fats

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the problem is with oils and fats

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.290 
the problem is with oils and fats
they're<00:00:45.480> eight<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.760> able<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> absorb

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they're eight times more able to absorb

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100 
they're eight times more able to absorb
oxygen<00:00:48.739> than<00:00:49.739> water<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.539> why<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.930> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
oxygen than water so that's why it's so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.860 
oxygen than water so that's why it's so
hard<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> oil<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.230> stay<00:00:56.180> stay<00:00:57.649> fresh<00:00:59.870> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
hard for a oil to stay stay fresh very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
hard for a oil to stay stay fresh very
quickly<00:01:01.199> once<00:01:01.770> he<00:01:02.010> gets<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.850> go

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
quickly once he gets into it it can go

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.170 
quickly once he gets into it it can go

way there's sunlight can't get to it

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.000 
way there's sunlight can't get to it
either<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.040> like<00:01:57.550> this<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.710> 10

either so like this it's it's in a 10
it's<00:02:00.729> very<00:02:01.060> good<00:02:01.300> to<00:02:01.540> store<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.020> way<00:02:02.229> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it's very good to store that way and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.510 
it's very good to store that way and
it'll<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.570> good<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.170> at<00:02:05.500> least<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.890> year<00:02:05.920> and

lying<00:02:37.660> obviously<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> problem<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:38.980> do

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
lying obviously the problem if you do

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.610 
lying obviously the problem if you do
that<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.670> likely<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.360> go<00:02:40.480> hard<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.110> don't

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
that it's likely to go hard on you don't

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
that it's likely to go hard on you don't

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
worry too much about that you just heat

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.479 
worry too much about that you just heat
it<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.720> again<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.290> it'll<00:02:44.470> melt<00:02:44.980> back<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.340> its

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
it up again and it'll melt back to its

prepping situation better than nothing

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.850 
prepping situation better than nothing
and<00:03:19.450> it'll<00:03:19.959> certainly<00:03:20.140> give<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.620> those

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
and it'll certainly give you those

and it'll certainly give you those
calories<00:03:22.799> obviously<00:03:23.799> don't<00:03:23.920> overdose<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
calories obviously don't overdose on the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.600 
calories obviously don't overdose on the
fat<00:03:24.970> too<00:03:25.299> much<00:03:25.450> fat<00:03:25.720> will<00:03:25.870> clog<00:03:26.080> up<00:03:26.110> your<00:03:26.230> veins

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
fat too much fat will clog up your veins

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
fat too much fat will clog up your veins
give<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.760> heart<00:03:27.940> attack<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.360> that's<00:03:28.510> not

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
give you a heart attack and that's not

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.539 
give you a heart attack and that's not
what<00:03:28.810> you're<00:03:28.959> after<00:03:29.080> but<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.890> little<00:03:30.340> bit<00:03:30.519> of

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
what you're after but a little bit of

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.920 
what you're after but a little bit of
fat<00:03:30.820> makes<00:03:31.090> up<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:32.730> good<00:03:33.730> part<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.269> an<00:03:34.450> overall

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
fat makes up a good part of an overall

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.110 
fat makes up a good part of an overall
balanced<00:03:35.410> diet

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
balanced diet

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.949 
balanced diet
so<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:39.010> I'd<00:03:39.160> say<00:03:39.400> ten<00:03:39.790> some<00:03:39.970> oil<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.750> ten

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
so what I'd say ten some oil and a ten

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.810 
so what I'd say ten some oil and a ten

to<00:04:03.069> reaching<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.459> ear<00:04:03.819> start<00:04:04.510> using<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.080> and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
to reaching that ear start using it and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.030 
to reaching that ear start using it and
buy<00:04:06.159> another<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.730> replace<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.599> so<00:04:07.959> if<00:04:08.709> you've
