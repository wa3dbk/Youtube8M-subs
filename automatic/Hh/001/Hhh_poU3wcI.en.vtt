beautiful way the back rails which

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.070 
beautiful way the back rails which
continue<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.000> form<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.330> back<00:04:59.479> legs<00:04:59.840> are

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
continue to form the back legs are

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.440 
continue to form the back legs are
actually<00:05:00.289> one<00:05:00.650> section<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.130> wood<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.639> go<00:05:02.210> from

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
actually one section of wood and go from

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.089 
actually one section of wood and go from
the<00:05:02.570> thickness<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.229> thinness<00:05:03.530> that's<00:05:03.919> quite

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
the thickness to a thinness that's quite

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.250 
the thickness to a thinness that's quite
elegant<00:05:04.520> while<00:05:05.120> at<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.330> same<00:05:05.360> time<00:05:05.599> taper

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
elegant while at the same time taper

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.680 
elegant while at the same time taper
inwards<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.220> curved<00:05:07.610> in<00:05:07.820> an<00:05:07.910> S<00:05:08.030> shape<00:05:08.300> so

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
inwards and curved in an S shape so

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.750 
inwards and curved in an S shape so
they're<00:05:08.810> very<00:05:09.200> difficult<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.830> construct<00:05:10.310> and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
they're very difficult to construct and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.580 
they're very difficult to construct and
actually<00:05:11.210> although<00:05:11.419> they<00:05:11.720> look<00:05:11.930> very<00:05:12.260> plain

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
actually although they look very plain

actually although they look very plain
and<00:05:12.800> very<00:05:13.250> simple<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:14.180> construction<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.780> very

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
and very simple the construction is very

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.860 
and very simple the construction is very
complex<00:05:16.000> one<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.180> interesting<00:05:17.479> aspects

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
complex one of the interesting aspects

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.719 
complex one of the interesting aspects
about<00:05:18.080> this<00:05:18.289> pair<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.650> chairs<00:05:18.889> is<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.490> wear

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
about this pair of chairs is the wear

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.600 
about this pair of chairs is the wear
that<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:20.030> see<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.539> you<00:05:21.080> can<00:05:21.229> see<00:05:21.530> from<00:05:22.220> the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
that you see and you can see from the

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.520 
that you see and you can see from the
beading<00:05:23.330> that<00:05:23.479> has<00:05:23.570> been<00:05:23.720> lost<00:05:23.930> on<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.260> front

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
beading that has been lost on the front

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.320 
beading that has been lost on the front
that<00:05:24.680> these<00:05:24.919> have<00:05:25.039> been<00:05:25.099> sat<00:05:25.400> in<00:05:25.639> for<00:05:25.910> hundreds

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
that these have been sat in for hundreds

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.120 
that these have been sat in for hundreds
of<00:05:26.419> years<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:27.320> takes<00:05:27.560> quite<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.860> lot<00:05:28.039> of

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
of years and it takes quite a lot of

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.939 
of years and it takes quite a lot of
time<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.490> develop<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:29.470> another<00:05:30.470> interesting

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
time to develop this another interesting

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.159 
time to develop this another interesting
aspect<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.639> fact<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.389> front<00:05:32.660> aprons

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
aspect is the fact that the front aprons

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.360 
aspect is the fact that the front aprons
and<00:05:33.320> spandrels<00:05:33.830> which<00:05:34.130> are<00:05:34.250> usually

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
and spandrels which are usually

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.719 
and spandrels which are usually
sectional<00:05:35.180> are<00:05:35.330> one-piece<00:05:36.310> this<00:05:37.310> was<00:05:37.550> done

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
sectional are one-piece this was done

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.339 
sectional are one-piece this was done
probably<00:05:38.090> because<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.780> members<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.169> this
