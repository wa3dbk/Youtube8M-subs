00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.310 

at<00:00:25.800> mile<00:00:26.099> marker<00:00:26.269> 51<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.570> Castleman<00:00:28.080> River

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
at mile marker 51 the Castleman River

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
at mile marker 51 the Castleman River
there's<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> background<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.669> I<00:00:30.509> think

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
there's in the background and I think

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.729 
there's in the background and I think
confluence<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> uh<00:00:32.210> mile<00:00:33.210> marker<00:00:33.690> 60<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.470> about

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
confluence is uh mile marker 60 so about

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.509 
confluence is uh mile marker 60 so about
ten<00:00:34.949> miles<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:36.470> so<00:00:37.470> far<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> rain<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> holding

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
ten miles and so far the rain is holding

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.639 
ten miles and so far the rain is holding
off<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> good<00:00:39.300> thing<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:40.260> beautiful

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
off which is a good thing it's beautiful

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
off which is a good thing it's beautiful
beautiful<00:00:40.769> trail<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:42.480> can't<00:00:42.690> imagine<00:00:42.780> like

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
beautiful trail just can't imagine like

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
beautiful trail just can't imagine like
I<00:00:43.350> said<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.949> think<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.519> trail<00:00:45.180> surface<00:00:45.449> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I said it's I think the trail surface is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.509 
I said it's I think the trail surface is
better<00:00:46.140> than<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> sea<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.199> know<00:00:49.400> looking<00:00:50.400> at

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
better than the sea you know looking at

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.490 
better than the sea you know looking at
the<00:00:50.699> tracks<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> trail<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.170> come<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the tracks on the trail so I come the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.460 
the tracks on the trail so I come the
first<00:00:52.769> one<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.339> come<00:00:53.460> through<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.879> morning

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
first one to come through this morning

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.319 
first one to come through this morning
it<00:00:55.470> rained<00:00:55.739> yesterday<00:00:56.250> pretty<00:00:56.790> good<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it rained yesterday pretty good so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
it rained yesterday pretty good so
that's<00:00:57.690> why<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> stayed<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> hospital<00:00:58.859> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that's why I stayed in the hospital but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's why I stayed in the hospital but
yeah<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:00.390> gonna<00:01:00.510> continue<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.769> through

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
yeah we're gonna continue on through

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:14.370 
yeah we're gonna continue on through
here<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.519> town<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> confluence

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.950 

so<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.149> bridge<00:01:17.149> over<00:01:17.359> the<00:01:17.539> cash<00:01:17.749> in

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so this is the bridge over the cash in

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.620 
so this is the bridge over the cash in
the<00:01:18.049> river<00:01:18.289> and<00:01:18.499> there's<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.549> tunnel<00:01:19.880> ahead<00:01:20.270> I

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the river and there's a tunnel ahead I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.690 
the river and there's a tunnel ahead I
believe<00:01:21.079> it's<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> Pinkerton<00:01:21.829> tunnel<00:01:22.189> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
believe it's the Pinkerton tunnel and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:47.200 
believe it's the Pinkerton tunnel and
the<00:01:22.819> Pinkerton<00:01:23.299> tunnel<00:01:23.630> is<00:01:23.689> closed

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.380 

you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.480 

or<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.200> beat<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.710> hopefully<00:01:53.160> it<00:01:53.220> won't<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.430> too

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
or to beat or hopefully it won't be too

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.210 
or to beat or hopefully it won't be too
steep<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.440> do<00:01:55.440> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.800> get<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.160> bridge

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
steep I do have to get over this bridge

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:10.080 
steep I do have to get over this bridge
at<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> tunnel<00:01:57.240> yeah<00:01:57.570> why<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.650> closed

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.720 

Pinker<00:02:10.810> didn't<00:02:11.020> bypass<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.740> I<00:02:12.190> got<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> special

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
Pinker didn't bypass and I got a special

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.260 
Pinker didn't bypass and I got a special
little<00:02:13.060> treat<00:02:13.360> here<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.160> jack<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
little treat here this is a jack in the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:34.070 
little treat here this is a jack in the
pulpit<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:19.440> long<00:02:20.440> time

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.890 

so<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.770> point<00:02:34.980> right<00:02:35.130> here<00:02:35.360> has<00:02:36.360> leaves<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so this point right here has leaves that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
so this point right here has leaves that
come<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.490> single<00:02:38.490> lobe<00:02:39.380> double<00:02:40.380> lobe<00:02:40.620> like

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
come in single lobe double lobe like

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
come in single lobe double lobe like
this<00:02:41.640> one<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.320> then<00:02:43.320> triple<00:02:44.130> lobe<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.290> this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this one and then triple lobe and this

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
this one and then triple lobe and this
actually<00:02:46.620> turns<00:02:46.830> into<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.100> small<00:02:47.430> tree<00:02:47.820> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
actually turns into a small tree this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.510 
actually turns into a small tree this
will<00:02:48.750> grow<00:02:48.900> into<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.170> small<00:02:49.410> tree<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.310> called

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
will grow into a small tree it's called

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.680 
will grow into a small tree it's called
sassafras<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.370> it's<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> basis<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
sassafras and it's the basis for that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:03.740 
sassafras and it's the basis for that
flavoring<00:02:55.380> root<00:02:55.560> beer<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> here's<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> other

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
flavoring root beer so here's the other

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.080 
flavoring root beer so here's the other
end<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.500> Pinkerton<00:03:05.490> tunnel<00:03:05.910> which<00:03:06.060> is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
end of the Pinkerton tunnel which is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.760 
end of the Pinkerton tunnel which is
closed<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.020> know<00:03:07.080> they<00:03:07.350> look<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.590> they

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
closed I don't know they look like they

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.020 
closed I don't know they look like they
clear<00:03:08.010> cut<00:03:12.920> mile<00:03:13.920> 1/2<00:03:14.100> 2<00:03:14.490> miles

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
very level the Pinkerton Tunnel is right

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.240 
very level the Pinkerton Tunnel is right
behind<00:03:19.800> me

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
behind me

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
behind me
and<00:03:20.460> I'm<00:03:20.730> now<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.240> bridge<00:03:21.450> back<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:22.020> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
and I'm now on this bridge back over the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:55.880 
and I'm now on this bridge back over the
Castleman<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.400> quite<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> bridge

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:12.650 

you

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:23.190 

how<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.410> confluence<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.370> negative<00:04:14.820> two<00:04:15.030> miles

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.260 

some<00:04:24.200> crossing<00:04:24.620> over<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.890> bridge<00:04:25.010> here<00:04:25.430> you

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
some crossing over the bridge here you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.370 
some crossing over the bridge here you
can<00:04:26.450> see<00:04:26.660> this<00:04:26.780> river<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.440> huge<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:30.140> cat

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
can see this river is huge and the cat

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.960 
can see this river is huge and the cat
the<00:04:30.620> town<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.070> our<00:04:31.220> confluence<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.150> over<00:04:32.390> here

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
the town of our confluence is over here

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:47.190 
the town of our confluence is over here
so<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.590> don't<00:04:36.590> know<00:04:36.850> what<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.000> name<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.240> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.310 

fluence

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
fluence

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.150 
fluence
is<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.220> outflow<00:04:49.760> Recreation<00:04:50.420> Area<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.160> it's

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
is the outflow Recreation Area and it's

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.740 
is the outflow Recreation Area and it's
probably<00:04:52.460> where<00:04:52.550> I'm<00:04:52.610> gonna<00:04:52.760> call<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.660> a<00:04:53.720> day

station<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:51.439> because<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.889> shower

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
station and it's because the shower

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.429 
station and it's because the shower
house<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.789> closed<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:54.020> they<00:05:54.110> have<00:05:54.229> a<00:05:54.259> reduced

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
house is closed so they have a reduced

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.309 
house is closed so they have a reduced
rate<00:05:54.919> which<00:05:55.909> I<00:05:56.180> think<00:05:56.449> eight<00:05:56.599> dollars<00:05:56.990> per

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
rate which I think eight dollars per

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.579 
rate which I think eight dollars per
night<00:05:57.349> is<00:05:58.060> acceptable<00:05:59.919> but<00:06:00.919> still<00:06:01.310> too<00:06:01.550> high<00:06:01.759> I

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
night is acceptable but still too high I

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.019 
night is acceptable but still too high I
think<00:06:03.589> the<00:06:03.680> federal<00:06:04.069> government<00:06:04.550> should<00:06:04.999> be

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
think the federal government should be

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.019 
think the federal government should be
doing<00:06:05.150> everything<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:06.680> they<00:06:07.159> possibly<00:06:07.189> can
