them away so long as a bull's-eye surely

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.980 
them away so long as a bull's-eye surely
uh<00:01:32.320> yeah<00:01:33.310> so<00:01:33.820> feel<00:01:34.210> free<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.450> run<00:01:34.720> around<00:01:34.840> the

uh yeah so feel free to run around the
conveyor<00:01:35.290> but<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.560> guess<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.920> would<00:01:36.010> make

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
conveyor but I guess that would make

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.270 
conveyor but I guess that would make
them<00:01:36.340> more<00:01:36.550> exciting<00:01:37.030> I<00:01:37.680> suppose<00:01:38.680> oh<00:01:38.890> here<00:01:39.250> we

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
them more exciting I suppose oh here we

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.800 
them more exciting I suppose oh here we
go<00:01:39.430> now<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.790> try<00:01:39.970> make<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.270> more<00:01:40.360> exciting<00:01:40.570> and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
go now to try make it more exciting and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.630 
go now to try make it more exciting and
we<00:01:41.380> will<00:01:41.500> probably<00:01:41.680> never<00:01:41.830> seen<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.520> them

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
we will probably never seen one of them

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.750 
we will probably never seen one of them
for<00:01:42.970> like<00:01:43.090> another<00:01:43.810> minute<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:45.490> wasn't

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
for like another minute one wasn't

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.540 
for like another minute one wasn't
enough<00:01:45.820> give<00:01:46.390> me<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.540> chuck<00:01:47.050> submissive<00:01:47.550> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
enough give me a chuck submissive the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.130 
enough give me a chuck submissive the
way<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.850> improve<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.479> one<00:01:49.630> was<00:01:49.840> putting

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140
