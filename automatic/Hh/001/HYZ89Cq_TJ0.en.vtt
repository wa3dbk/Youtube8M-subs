00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.240
 I just want to explain the net user 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.070
 Insulating paints as they become captives and formulated with ceramic beads 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.229
 Being done 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.579
 Heat insulation can be obtained just by coming out 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.439
 It is amazing 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 Then I want to start the experiment immediately 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.329
 It is a result that has not returned to this side 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.349
 Here is the situation of heat insulation paint opening Lotta 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.020
 I refrained from this 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020
 I put the heat and finished 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.870
 Current 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.600
 I would like to measure Peter's temperature 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 This is digital ok 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 I feel high clothes such as machines 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 30 at mtv Japan 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.970
 Pharmaceutical Now once again there is Onosawa, but 34 and Goto 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.250
 It has become before and after 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 For example, I would like to add heat 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 I want to set Mitsuoka Garinko 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.650
 This ghost story and a straight line 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.050
 This is also catering for rockets 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.880
 I wanted to combine the thermal insulation technology used in the appearance 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 It is already over 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.310
 Why the heat insulation effect is obtained 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.250
 For painting the roof outer wall 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 For example, it works very well 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.090
 The color variations are as you see 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 Various colors are variations 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.040
 I have 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 For example, I put a net 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 I would like to measure the temperature of Yoritomo 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.560
 First of all 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 I said that I was not angry 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.720
 Currently 57 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.089
 There was a hummingbird 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.349
 This is a steel plate of Ukraine 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.649
 Currently $ 47 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.889
 Let's see it again 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.599
 This is the place I've met 59 now 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.599
 89 years old 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
 Hainan Island 49 in general 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.069
 It is judo now 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 You can confirm this was just touching it with your hand 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.669
 And when the sun goes down, the sun holds 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.479
 Even if you 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.479
 It's too bad, but if it's one, it's heating 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.599
 I think that the sun went down 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.599
 Look at the speed of high blood pressure 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 The word is normal 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.639
 The speed at which the temperature drops 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.339
 It's late 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.039
 And let's look outside 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.689
 You can see that the speed at which the temperature falls is fast 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.099
 Because I do not store heat like this 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.209
 But now 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.729
 It is affected by heat 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.289
 Monthly amount 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.999
 It's a lifetime to spend comfortably while traveling 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.999
 is 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.249
 About the Internet Industry 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.229
 Please inquire the humiliating spring
