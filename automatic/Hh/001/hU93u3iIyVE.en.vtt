00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
script follows the same thing 31-17 they

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.759 
script follows the same thing 31-17 they
had<00:00:20.900> what<00:00:22.039> 57<00:00:23.039> plays<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.670> had<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:24.000> 78

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
had what 57 plays we had about 78

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.960 
had what 57 plays we had about 78
somehow<00:00:25.769> another<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> made<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> bunch<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> third

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
somehow another we made a bunch of third

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
somehow another we made a bunch of third
downs<00:00:27.240> early<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> late<00:00:28.140> didn't<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.890> much<00:00:29.070> in

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
downs early and late didn't make much in

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
downs early and late didn't make much in
between<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.179> got<00:00:30.359> stymied<00:00:30.960> trying<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
between we really got stymied trying to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
between we really got stymied trying to
run<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> ball<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.910> fortunately<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
run the ball but fortunately the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.900 
run the ball but fortunately the
quarterback<00:00:34.140> draw<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.160> us<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.670> jam

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
quarterback draw it got us out of a jam

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
quarterback draw it got us out of a jam
and<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> guess<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> game<00:00:38.520> was

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and you know I guess when the game was

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.930 
and you know I guess when the game was
tied<00:00:38.700> during<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> fourth<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.700> kind<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> made

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
tied during the fourth and kind of made

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
tied during the fourth and kind of made
about<00:00:42.120> 11<00:00:42.480> yards<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:42.960> third<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> 12<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.950> then

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
about 11 yards on third and 12 and then

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
about 11 yards on third and 12 and then
we<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.850> him<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.120> site<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> fourth<00:00:45.930> down

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
we got him off site on the fourth down

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.069 
we got him off site on the fourth down
was<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.219> big<00:00:47.550> play<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> game<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.960> our

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
was was a big play in the game but our

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.029 
was was a big play in the game but our
defense<00:00:49.260> again<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:52.039> guess

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
defense again was very good and I guess

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889 
defense again was very good and I guess
we<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> couple<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> turnovers<00:00:53.940> special

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there early and then they got a lot of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
there early and then they got a lot of
pressure<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> us<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:35.130> number<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
pressure on us that number three of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
pressure on us that number three of
theirs<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> good<00:01:37.020> rusher<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.070> were

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
theirs is a good rusher and we were

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
theirs is a good rusher and we were
probably<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:39.210> couldn't<00:01:39.479> find<00:01:39.570> any<00:01:39.720> running

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
probably we couldn't find any running

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
probably we couldn't find any running
place<00:01:40.200> works<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.799> quarterback<00:01:41.130> draw<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.270> they

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
my part and then we had another

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
my part and then we had another
opportunity<00:01:59.399> seemed<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.299> right<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
opportunity seemed like right there

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.670 
opportunity seemed like right there
didn't<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.170> anything<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.710> midfield<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
didn't do anything from midfield so

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.220 
didn't do anything from midfield so
yeah<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.760> had<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.910> look<00:02:05.060> top<00:02:05.900> pass

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
yeah and then we had to look top pass

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.919 
yeah and then we had to look top pass
that<00:02:06.830> Connor<00:02:07.100> he<00:02:07.610> said<00:02:07.820> got<00:02:08.060> tempted<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.660> he<00:02:08.780> I

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that Connor he said got tempted but he I

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.180 
that Connor he said got tempted but he I
think<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.289> came<00:02:09.440> out<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.710> his<00:02:09.770> hand<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.070> little

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
think it came out of his hand a little

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.850 
think it came out of his hand a little
low<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:11.300> we<00:02:11.900> finally<00:02:12.110> hit<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.440> one<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.710> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
low but we finally hit that one with a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.660 
low but we finally hit that one with a
row<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.700> we<00:02:13.850> put<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.780> week<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
row and we put that one in this week and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.970 
row and we put that one in this week and
just<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.910> thought<00:02:17.440> should<00:02:18.440> call<00:02:18.650> them<00:02:18.830> about

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
just I thought should call them about

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.320 
just I thought should call them about
third<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.550> but<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.910> was<00:02:20.000> third<00:02:20.180> and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
third and one but it was third and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.970 
third and one but it was third and
fourth<00:02:20.570> that<00:02:20.959> was<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> last<00:02:21.320> chance<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.800> use

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
fourth that was the last chance to use

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.270 
fourth that was the last chance to use
it<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.940> had<00:02:23.030> parted<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.660> there<00:02:23.900> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
it so when it had parted in there and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970 
it so when it had parted in there and
and<00:02:25.630> Brandon<00:02:26.630> he<00:02:26.840> didn't<00:02:27.140> come<00:02:27.320> out<00:02:27.590> clean

too<00:04:16.730> bad<00:04:16.940> we<00:04:17.090> jumped<00:04:17.390> offside<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.960> time<00:04:18.140> we

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
too bad we jumped offside the time we

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.500 
too bad we jumped offside the time we
stopped<00:04:18.590> him<00:04:18.680> on<00:04:18.860> the<00:04:18.950> fourth<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.400> one<00:04:19.550> but

maybe<00:04:56.420> at<00:04:56.720> Missouri<00:04:57.080> loss<00:04:57.380> but<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:58.460> looks<00:04:58.670> like

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
maybe at Missouri loss but it looks like

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.420 
maybe at Missouri loss but it looks like
now<00:04:59.000> Auburn
