this<00:00:42.040> um<00:00:42.400> plush<00:00:43.360> toy<00:00:43.660> I<00:00:43.900> think<00:00:44.199> I<00:00:44.350> think<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.949> was

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
this um plush toy I think I think it was

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.880 
this um plush toy I think I think it was
probably<00:00:45.340> gonna<00:00:45.670> be<00:00:45.910> the<00:00:46.120> least<00:00:46.900> expected<00:00:47.559> to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
probably gonna be the least expected to

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.280 
probably gonna be the least expected to
be<00:00:48.040> released<00:00:48.070> because<00:00:48.699> for<00:00:49.090> one<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.690> isn't<00:00:50.199> a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
be released because for one it isn't a

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.680 
be released because for one it isn't a
plush<00:00:50.500> penguin<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.910> so<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.980> it's<00:00:54.790> not<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.239> plush

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
plush penguin but so if it's not a plush

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.080 
plush penguin but so if it's not a plush
penguin<00:00:55.960> then<00:00:56.890> has<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.160> be<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.399> plush<00:00:57.640> animal

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
penguin then has to be a plush animal

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.450 
penguin then has to be a plush animal

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
which is a little bit confusing now um

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
also comes with this as well so this

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.820 
also comes with this as well so this
this<00:01:12.670> Herbert<00:01:13.149> p<00:01:13.330> bear<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.850> series<00:01:16.509> 10<00:01:16.930> toy

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
this Herbert p bear is a series 10 toy

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.340 
this Herbert p bear is a series 10 toy
and<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:19.300> was<00:01:19.660> its<00:01:20.590> series<00:01:21.070> 10<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
and it was its series 10 and it's the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.100 
and it was its series 10 and it's the
first<00:01:23.380> one<00:01:24.190> it's<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.729> first<00:01:24.910> wave<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:25.899> is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
first one it's the first wave which is

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.280 
first one it's the first wave which is
which<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:26.800> is<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.640> think<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.869> main

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
which it is in and I think it's the main

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.370 
which it is in and I think it's the main
character<00:01:32.290> in<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:33.280> series<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:34.420> don't<00:01:35.200> really

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
let's review the stuff well I think for

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.460 
let's review the stuff well I think for
I<00:01:42.369> think<00:01:42.700> from<00:01:42.909> here<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.180> does<00:01:43.509> look<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:44.049> lot

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
I think from here it does look a lot

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.780 
I think from here it does look a lot
like<00:01:45.100> Herbert<00:01:45.549> PP<00:01:46.450> bear<00:01:46.659> like<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.080> eyebrows

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
like Herbert PP bear like the eyebrows

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.289 
like Herbert PP bear like the eyebrows
that's<00:01:48.790> also<00:01:49.060> matching<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:51.189> further<00:01:51.640> texture

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
that's also matching the further texture

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.069 
that's also matching the further texture
the<00:01:52.570> up<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.020> ears<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.850> one<00:01:55.329> has<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.750> little

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
the up the ears this one has a little

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.980 
the up the ears this one has a little
ear<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.770> goes<00:01:57.009> back<00:01:57.250> too<00:01:57.549> far<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:57.990> they

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
ear that goes back too far and they

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
ear that goes back too far and they
stuck<00:01:59.439> on<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.920> um<00:02:00.689> soft<00:02:01.689> light<00:02:02.470> um<00:02:03.150> I<00:02:04.170> know

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
stuck on this um soft light um I know

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.199 
stuck on this um soft light um I know
what<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.329> it<00:02:07.479> fabric<00:02:08.259> which<00:02:09.250> makes<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.940> fur

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
what is it fabric which makes the fur

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.780 
what is it fabric which makes the fur
near<00:02:10.750> his<00:02:10.899> mouth<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.950> that's<00:02:12.130> really

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
near his mouth and I think that's really

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
near his mouth and I think that's really
good<00:02:13.180> um<00:02:14.130> although<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:16.480> other<00:02:16.750> things<00:02:17.230> can't

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
good um although like other things can't

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.039 
good um although like other things can't
move<00:02:18.040> very<00:02:18.070> much<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.820> his<00:02:19.360> arms<00:02:19.690> can't<00:02:19.989> move

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
move very much and his arms can't move

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.789 
move very much and his arms can't move
either<00:02:20.410> they're<00:02:20.799> stuck<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.790> body<00:02:22.799> yeah

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
either they're stuck to the body yeah

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.069 
either they're stuck to the body yeah
from<00:02:24.040> an<00:02:24.160> angle<00:02:24.519> he<00:02:24.670> does<00:02:24.850> look<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.420> actually

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
from an angle he does look like actually

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.350 
from an angle he does look like actually
her<00:02:26.260> would<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.470> bear<00:02:26.799> also<00:02:27.640> his<00:02:27.730> tails<00:02:28.030> pretty

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
her would be bear also his tails pretty

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.680 
her would be bear also his tails pretty
good<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.890> sign<00:02:30.190> isn't<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.640> big<00:02:30.880> there's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690

good and the sign isn't that big there's
also<00:02:31.840> um<00:02:32.410> details<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.819> pause<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
also um details to the pause and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.100 
also um details to the pause and
strangely

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
strangely

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.930 
strangely
there's<00:02:37.290> also<00:02:37.530> detailed<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.460> feet<00:02:38.730> as

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
there's also detailed to the feet as

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.750 
there's also detailed to the feet as
well<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.440> no<00:02:40.650> Club<00:02:40.950> Penguin<00:02:41.460> sign

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
well but there is no Club Penguin sign

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.270 
well but there is no Club Penguin sign
which<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:43.080> thought<00:02:43.350> was<00:02:43.500> strange<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.130> also

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
which I thought was strange but also

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.680 
which I thought was strange but also
good<00:02:44.700> at<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.880> same<00:02:45.120> time<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.920> think<00:02:47.690> Herbert

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
good at the same time so I think Herbert

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.920 
good at the same time so I think Herbert
was<00:02:48.780> made<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.580> think<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.330> lot<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
was made because I think a lot of the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.540 
was made because I think a lot of the
fans<00:02:52.260> wanted<00:02:52.890> him<00:02:53.870> because<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.320> don't<00:02:56.130> know<00:02:56.220> um

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
fans wanted him because I don't know um
