00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
almost completely different but I guess

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.640 
almost completely different but I guess
that's<00:05:55.090> just<00:05:55.180> part<00:05:55.510> of<00:05:55.630> growing<00:05:55.780> up<00:05:56.080> times

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
that's just part of growing up times

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.640 
that's just part of growing up times
change<00:05:57.100> people<00:05:57.520> change<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:58.480> change<00:05:58.840> and<00:05:59.140> the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
change people change you change and the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.020 
change people change you change and the
only<00:05:59.770> thing<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.010> can<00:06:00.130> do<00:06:00.250> is<00:06:00.370> just<00:06:00.520> accept<00:06:00.850> it

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
only thing you can do is just accept it

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.880 
only thing you can do is just accept it
and<00:06:01.150> move<00:06:01.210> on<00:06:01.540> but<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.260> never<00:06:02.440> forget<00:06:02.740> your

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
and move on but you never forget your

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.350 
and move on but you never forget your
roots<00:06:02.950> and<00:06:03.340> what<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:03.670> was<00:06:03.790> like<00:06:03.820> before

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
roots and what it was like before

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.970 
roots and what it was like before
maybe<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.990> reason<00:06:05.260> my<00:06:05.380> golden<00:06:05.650> age<00:06:05.770> was<00:06:05.950> the

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
maybe the reason my golden age was the

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.650 
maybe the reason my golden age was the
period<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.430> got<00:06:06.610> into<00:06:06.820> anime<00:06:06.970> was<00:06:07.240> because<00:06:07.540> of

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
period I got into anime was because of

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.630 
period I got into anime was because of
the<00:06:07.750> nostalgia<00:06:08.050> effect<00:06:08.560> especially<00:06:08.920> now<00:06:09.430> when

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
the nostalgia effect especially now when

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.340 
the nostalgia effect especially now when
I<00:06:09.700> look<00:06:09.880> back<00:06:09.910> myself<00:06:10.510> at<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.720> time<00:06:10.900> when<00:06:11.050> anime

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
I look back myself at a time when anime

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.080 
I look back myself at a time when anime
was<00:06:11.530> still<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.800> new<00:06:12.070> thing<00:06:12.340> for<00:06:12.370> me<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.760> just

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
was still a new thing for me I just

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.600 
was still a new thing for me I just
remember<00:06:13.750> how<00:06:13.900> exciting<00:06:14.410> it<00:06:14.530> was<00:06:14.610> everything

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
remember how exciting it was everything

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.460 
remember how exciting it was everything
was<00:06:15.730> still<00:06:15.970> new<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.480> fresh<00:06:16.750> I<00:06:17.110> was

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
was still new and fresh I was

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.900 
was still new and fresh I was
discovering<00:06:17.920> a<00:06:18.010> new<00:06:18.220> world<00:06:18.250> through<00:06:18.640> sugar

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
discovering a new world through sugar

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.610 
discovering a new world through sugar
coated<00:06:19.240> glasses<00:06:19.660> so<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:20.020> course<00:06:20.230> everything

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
coated glasses so of course everything

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.230 
coated glasses so of course everything
would<00:06:20.830> have<00:06:20.920> been<00:06:21.040> amazing<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.670> right<00:06:22.180> now

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
would have been amazing and right now

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.390 
would have been amazing and right now
when<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.660> reflect<00:06:23.050> back<00:06:23.230> on<00:06:23.260> that<00:06:23.500> time<00:06:23.710> I<00:06:23.890> still

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
when I reflect back on that time I still

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.100 
when I reflect back on that time I still
get<00:06:24.580> the<00:06:24.610> feeling<00:06:24.820> of<00:06:25.000> nostalgia<00:06:25.360> even<00:06:25.870> if<00:06:25.990> it

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
get the feeling of nostalgia even if it

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.720 
get the feeling of nostalgia even if it
might<00:06:26.260> have<00:06:26.410> been<00:06:26.620> as<00:06:26.710> great<00:06:26.920> as<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.340> remember

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
might have been as great as I remember

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.820 
might have been as great as I remember
it<00:06:27.820> being<00:06:28.030> but<00:06:28.690> that's<00:06:29.230> how<00:06:29.350> I<00:06:29.380> started

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
it being but that's how I started

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.560 
it being but that's how I started
goggles<00:06:30.130> work<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:30.670> I<00:06:30.760> doubt<00:06:31.060> that<00:06:31.300> would<00:06:31.420> ever

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
goggles work and I doubt that would ever

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.180 
goggles work and I doubt that would ever
stop<00:06:31.810> happening<00:06:32.020> in<00:06:32.290> his<00:06:32.380> new<00:06:32.560> age<00:06:32.710> either
