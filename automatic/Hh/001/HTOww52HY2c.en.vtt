thousand<00:00:44.199> miles<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.769> will<00:00:45.129> go<00:00:45.280> up<00:00:45.399> slightly

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
thousand miles that will go up slightly

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
thousand miles that will go up slightly
as<00:00:45.970> I'm<00:00:46.120> using<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.720> everyday<00:00:46.930> at<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.230> moment

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.040 

you've<00:00:53.710> got<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> lot<00:00:55.659> of<00:00:55.690> history<00:00:56.019> with

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
you've got quite a lot of history with

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.569 
you've got quite a lot of history with
it<00:00:56.229> I<00:00:56.290> think<00:00:56.470> enough<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.860> say<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.190> mileage<00:00:57.460> is

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
it I think enough to say the mileage is

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.049 
it I think enough to say the mileage is
probably<00:00:57.820> correct<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:59.559> go

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.439 

so<00:01:02.690> we<00:01:03.079> talked<00:01:03.199> about<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.500> um<00:01:04.269> starts<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.390> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
so we talked about it um starts on the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.730 
so we talked about it um starts on the
button<00:01:05.690> whether<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:05.990> hot<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.170> cold<00:01:06.470> just

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
button whether it's hot or cold just

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.950 
button whether it's hot or cold just
obviously<00:01:07.070> wait<00:01:07.670> for<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.940> diesel<00:01:08.600> night<00:01:08.840> to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
obviously wait for the diesel night to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.310 
obviously wait for the diesel night to
go<00:01:09.080> out<00:01:09.940> for<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> plug<00:01:11.240> heater<00:01:11.420> light

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.230 

and<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:15.980> performs<00:01:16.310> really<00:01:16.460> well<00:01:16.550> it's<00:01:16.820> got<00:01:17.000> a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
and it performs really well it's got a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640 
and it performs really well it's got a
really<00:01:17.420> nice<00:01:17.600> cold<00:01:17.900> air<00:01:18.050> conditioning<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.590> you

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
really nice cold air conditioning if you

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.530

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
want it wandering with the weather

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.700 
want it wandering with the weather
