 furniture monster hi picture the most 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 I like interesting all the furniture 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 associated with nesting dolls I would with 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 gladly bought it all but I have to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.600
 Sorry, no where to put it out 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.579
 I like the latest furniture set 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.489
 home their classroom where the kitchen 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.030
 abejita and not yet released sets where 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.289
 table soccer 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.480
 there is something related to scrap and ghouls and 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.820
 part of the mount or there fell on the box 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.580
 of course I masterfully drawn 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.430
 I explain but 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.800
 the bottom is clear from the next photo 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.290
 question from christina she asks how i 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.030
 I treat to the report about the monster high from 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.260
 television 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.390
 At first it was certainly a shame 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.900
 I wanted to tear and throw off thousands 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.090
 denials will be with every reportage i 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 I understood that they just do not pay 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.360
 attention to what's a haircut on with something 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.730
 teaches we start to create and create 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.000
 something they are not interested in some 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.460
 degrees they may even want more 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.820
 more we pissed off to take a new one 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.250
 report on how children 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.710
 correlations in the reprisal comments in 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.350
 In general, I think it's just useless. 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.690
 need not pay attention to this Daria 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.650
 the sheet asks me both besides 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.140
 monster high 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.050
 and actually love a lot 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.160
 do i play guitar i love 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 draw live cook do something 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.100
 do it yourself 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.940
 I have a lot of hobbies but time 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.390
 everything is missing 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.010
 questions ginger heads why i love 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.900
 bully 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.090
 because we are very similar to her and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.880
 principle my favorite monsters 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.390
 are zombies and as everyone knows more 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.940
 zombie 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.880
 maria asks if i had you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.110
 can take one of the things or dolls then 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.400
 what i would take 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 and you can think are proud antara 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.720
 the universe of needlework scheme Kovalchuk 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 asks if I wanted them to reset 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.470
 dolls of course some moments come 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.260
 such a time that I was thinking about not 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.080
 Do take the sword to others and once in 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.540
 Kama's treatment was too much lost but now 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.450
 my life without dolls at all i'm not 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.660
 I present the following five questions 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.650
 creates here it and here is the first question 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.410
 what a friend laurel and my nyashnaya on my 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.250
 taste i don't usually pick out any dolls 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.070
 among the rest 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.459
 but the most cute seems to me draculaura 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.470
 school name is from it to the slopes of the second 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.410
 question what feelings was experienced from 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.050
 unpacking the parcel when it comes 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.959
 Parcel with Natasha of course there is some 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.200
 share the experience if it curves 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.510
 are your eyes all right 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.420
 but mostly it is of course joy 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.170
 I want to rather cuddle the opening 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.400
 and and take pictures and the third question 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.610
 this is what reviewer I am friends with 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.030
 previous asthma video brain second 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.650
 release talked about their loved ones 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.290
 monster hi logr 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.170
 and in principle with all of them I am friends and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.519
 maintained a good relationship 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.540
 the only thing I forgot to say about 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.720
 Alice channel Alice for what I ask her more 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.950
 time forgiveness i love her channel she 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.400
 very nice girl and her mom too 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.950
 I hope she forgave me 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.530
 I advise you all to go to her channel 4 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.190
 The question is what is my favorite store with 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.430
 Monster now in many stores 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.639
 toys have dolls even probably 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.160
 almost all but 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.930
 the assortment of course is not very big for 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.570
 the prices are quite reasonable 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.840
 and so I still love the empire store 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.710
 dolls because there is a huge selection 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.699
 monsters 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.380
 and you can immediately see select and 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.260
 buy your favorite 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.169
 that is, there is no such risk as when ordering 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.860
 on the internet that it depends on something 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.870
 not the last and the fifth question is what 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.330
 meeting monster hi laver was the most 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.759
 fun 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.830
 I always remember meeting in 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.319
 Last year 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.159

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.960
 about 30 people came it was the first 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.560
 meeting in St. Petersburg when it came so much 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.639
 people and there were almost all my friends we 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.319
 fear and laurels and really i see 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.340
 spent time and would love to 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:22.250
 repeat it you hope what else 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.360
 will present such an opportunity as well as 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.400
 last year in July I traveled to Moscow on 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.219
 meeting and there also did not like it very much 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.830
 I finally met Moscow 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.349
 monster high liners, too, everything is very 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.110
 very nice people hope i can 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.789
 still come to Moscow 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.280
 the next question is from mariana she 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.779
 asks if I will rent a hall or 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.270
 so most likely I will shoot for sure 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:55.250
 I will shoot t to and monster high laver 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.930
 and maybe some more if you 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.389
 I want to give some back as a 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.000
 write it in the comments and the hall 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.759
 probably not because I basically do not 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.210
 watching videos of this kind and not not 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.610
 I guess, that 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.210
 you will be interested to watch them in my 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.970
 performance 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.569
 In general, I do not know but in the near future 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.349
 exactly 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:19.560
