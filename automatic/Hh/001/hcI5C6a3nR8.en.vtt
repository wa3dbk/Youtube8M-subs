00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
been the humid humid air and so we're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.359 
been the humid humid air and so we're
now<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.199> reposition<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.920> position<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
now going to reposition you position the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:50.110 
now going to reposition you position the
elevator<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:31.219> now

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.090 

okay<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.199> i<00:00:51.260> want<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.969> get<00:00:52.969> his<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.989> don't<00:00:54.649> want

okay so i want to get his I don't want
these<00:00:55.390> upper<00:00:56.390> wings<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.930> be<00:00:57.610> further<00:00:59.260> further

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
these upper wings to be further further

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.930 
these upper wings to be further further
forward<00:01:00.769> be<00:01:00.920> nice<00:01:01.160> but<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.519> think<00:01:01.730> they're

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
forward be nice but I think they're

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:32.130 
forward be nice but I think they're
pretty<00:01:02.510> much<00:01:02.719> set<00:01:05.680> okay<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:07.840> nice<00:01:08.840> long<00:01:09.140> one

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.880 

now<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.540> paper<00:01:34.540> is<00:01:35.010> now<00:01:36.270> humid<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.690> it's<00:01:38.680> going

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
now the paper is now humid so it's going

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.340 
now the paper is now humid so it's going
to<00:01:38.979> shrink<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:40.210> hopefully<00:01:40.659> keep<00:01:40.840> these<00:01:41.080> nice

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
to shrink and hopefully keep these nice

00:01:41.350 --> 00:02:12.100 
to shrink and hopefully keep these nice
and<00:01:41.530> tight

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.970 

worrying<00:02:12.920> about<00:02:13.010> symmetry<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:14.410> one<00:02:15.410> elevator

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
worrying about symmetry of one elevator

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.720 
worrying about symmetry of one elevator
route<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.850> go<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.420> sure<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.690> they're<00:02:17.870> both

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
route to go make sure that they're both

00:02:18.730 --> 00:03:07.150 
route to go make sure that they're both
same<00:02:22.180> similar<00:02:23.180> if<00:02:23.390> they<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.750> manage

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.480 

not<00:03:08.150> too<00:03:08.270> bad
