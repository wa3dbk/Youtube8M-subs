because the insects could be a real
problem<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.530> another<00:01:40.829> moth

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
problem and there was another moth

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.230 
problem and there was another moth
called<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.820> fake<00:01:42.060> moth<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:43.970> was<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.149> the

same<00:01:45.450> size<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> appearance<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
same size and appearance but it was a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.480 
same size and appearance but it was a
darker<00:01:47.850> gray<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:49.290> both<00:01:49.500> flew<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.250> night

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
about dusk so that's one of the reasons

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
why you need to get the food in if you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.080 
why you need to get the food in if you
do<00:01:57.869> try<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.619> food<00:01:58.799> outdoors<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:01.170> would

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
do try your food outdoors and they would

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.109 
do try your food outdoors and they would
one<00:02:03.090> book<00:02:03.299> said<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.520> food<00:02:05.729> should<00:02:06.000> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
one book said that the food should be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.830

could get through it and was better if

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.690 
could get through it and was better if
you<00:02:17.370> could<00:02:17.550> cover<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.240> food<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.870> class<00:02:19.140> and

boxes that are covered with glass they
also<00:03:10.410> said<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.010> food<00:03:11.190> needed<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.700> be

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
also said that the food needed to be

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.490 
also said that the food needed to be
turned<00:03:12.630> over<00:03:12.920> occasionally<00:03:15.140> here's<00:03:16.140> another

turned over occasionally here's another

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.199 
turned over occasionally here's another
method<00:03:16.770> they<00:03:17.070> would<00:03:17.250> use<00:03:17.550> there<00:03:18.030> are<00:03:18.060> little

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
method they would use there are little

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.940 
method they would use there are little
frames<00:03:18.600> they<00:03:18.840> would<00:03:18.989> build<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.530> then<00:03:19.650> drape

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
frames they would build and then drape

muslin or cheesecloth in between these

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.090 
muslin or cheesecloth in between these
little<00:03:24.269> stands<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.620> would<00:03:25.800> think<00:03:25.890> this

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
little stands but I would think this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.680 
little stands but I would think this
would<00:03:26.250> be<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.370> problem<00:03:26.700> bringing<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.300> food<00:03:27.510> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
would be a problem bringing the food in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.320 
would be a problem bringing the food in
every<00:03:27.930> night<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:29.340> way<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.700> people<00:03:29.880> really

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
every night the way that people really

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.479 
every night the way that people really
prefer<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.840> dry<00:03:31.050> their<00:03:31.230> foods<00:03:31.500> was<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.310> their

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.520 
prefer to dry their foods was in their
ovens<00:03:32.880> they<00:03:33.720> would<00:03:33.870> put<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.440> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
ovens they would put it in there and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.140 
ovens they would put it in there and
leave<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> door<00:03:35.040> open<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.400> bit<00:03:35.580> or<00:03:35.940> they

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
leave the door open a little bit or they

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.970 
leave the door open a little bit or they
would<00:03:36.300> use<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> heat<00:03:36.840> from<00:03:37.019> their<00:03:37.260> ovens<00:03:37.709> like

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
would use the heat from their ovens like

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.540 
would use the heat from their ovens like

city and they said that dehydrating the
food<00:05:23.310> was<00:05:23.520> great<00:05:23.640> because<00:05:23.940> it<00:05:24.090> was<00:05:24.240> easier<00:05:24.570> to

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
food was great because it was easier to

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.970 
food was great because it was easier to
transport<00:05:26.990> some<00:05:27.990> time<00:05:28.230> around<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.770> late

1800s advances have been made in canning

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.480 
1800s advances have been made in canning
so<00:05:33.150> dehydrating<00:05:34.050> fell<00:05:34.380> out<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.710> favor<00:05:35.130> and

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
so dehydrating fell out of favor and

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.940 
so dehydrating fell out of favor and
they<00:05:35.970> said<00:05:36.240> they<00:05:36.419> went<00:05:36.630> pretty<00:05:37.320> much<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.560> whole

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
they said they went pretty much a whole

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.810 
they said they went pretty much a whole
generation<00:05:38.190> without<00:05:39.030> dehydrating<00:05:39.990> foods

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
generation without dehydrating foods

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.390 
generation without dehydrating foods
wasn't<00:05:41.820> until<00:05:42.090> World<00:05:42.360> War<00:05:42.510> one<00:05:43.130> started<00:05:44.130> that

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
wasn't until World War one started that

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.330 
wasn't until World War one started that
they<00:05:44.580> realized<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.270> importance<00:05:45.780> of<00:05:46.050> having

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
they realized the importance of having

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.630 
they realized the importance of having
dehydrated<00:05:47.340> foods<00:05:47.640> so<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:49.590> became<00:05:50.460> a<00:05:50.520> big

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
dehydrated foods so that became a big

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.100 
dehydrated foods so that became a big
thing<00:05:51.090> once<00:05:51.390> again<00:05:53.660> another<00:05:54.660> reason<00:05:55.080> that

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
thing once again another reason that

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.560 
thing once again another reason that
they've<00:05:55.590> kind<00:05:56.550> of<00:05:56.669> pulled<00:05:56.940> away<00:05:57.030> from

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
they've kind of pulled away from

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.680 
they've kind of pulled away from
dehydrated<00:05:58.380> foods<00:05:58.680> was<00:05:59.100> because<00:05:59.669> when<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.570> was

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
dehydrated foods was because when it was

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.780 
dehydrated foods was because when it was
done<00:06:00.840> on<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:01.020> commercial<00:06:01.560> basis<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.430> was<00:06:02.580> so

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
done on a commercial basis it was so

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.860 
done on a commercial basis it was so
inferior<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.810> what<00:06:04.470> they<00:06:04.740> could<00:06:04.919> do<00:06:05.040> at<00:06:05.250> home

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
inferior to what they could do at home

the<00:06:07.160> store-bought<00:06:08.160> dehydrated<00:06:09.030> food<00:06:09.210> was

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
the store-bought dehydrated food was

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.430 
the store-bought dehydrated food was
often<00:06:10.190> moldy<00:06:11.190> or<00:06:12.080> infested<00:06:13.080> with<00:06:13.230> bugs

out in the fields the commercially dried

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.250 
out in the fields the commercially dried
foods<00:06:20.790> were<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:21.240> bad<00:06:21.450> that<00:06:21.480> it<00:06:21.840> just<00:06:22.020> turned

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
foods were so bad that it just turned

again we went several generations
without<00:07:11.099> dehydrating<00:07:12.060> foods<00:07:12.330> and<00:07:12.719> once<00:07:13.020> again

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:16.689 
without dehydrating foods and once again
we've<00:07:13.560> realized<00:07:13.979> the<00:07:14.389> value<00:07:15.389> of<00:07:15.629> it<00:07:15.810> and

we've realized the value of it and
everybody<00:07:17.699> is<00:07:18.000> gone<00:07:18.419> back<00:07:18.689> to<00:07:18.960> dehydrating

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
everybody is gone back to dehydrating

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.390 
everybody is gone back to dehydrating
and<00:07:20.189> by<00:07:20.969> the<00:07:21.029> ways<00:07:21.740> I'm<00:07:22.740> going<00:07:22.800> to<00:07:23.069> put<00:07:23.219> some

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:04.379 
these methods be sure to have one hand a

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:06.740 
these methods be sure to have one hand a
thermometer<00:08:04.889> that<00:08:05.159> will<00:08:05.490> read<00:08:05.729> between<00:08:06.089> say<00:08:06.719> a

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:06.750 
thermometer that will read between say a

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.510 
thermometer that will read between say a
hundred<00:08:07.199> and<00:08:07.289> hundred<00:08:07.589> fifty<00:08:07.830> degrees<00:08:08.219> they

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 
hundred and hundred fifty degrees they

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.159 
hundred and hundred fifty degrees they
would<00:08:08.669> lay<00:08:08.819> a<00:08:08.849> thermometer<00:08:09.449> in<00:08:09.629> the<00:08:09.750> bottom<00:08:10.050> of

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:10.169 
would lay a thermometer in the bottom of

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:11.839 
would lay a thermometer in the bottom of
the<00:08:10.289> tray<00:08:10.620> and<00:08:10.919> keep<00:08:11.370> track<00:08:11.580> of<00:08:11.759> the

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:11.849 
the tray and keep track of the

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:14.600 
the tray and keep track of the
temperature<00:08:12.270> that<00:08:12.330> way<00:08:12.830> so<00:08:13.830> that's<00:08:14.159> how<00:08:14.399> they

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.610 
temperature that way so that's how they

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.909 
temperature that way so that's how they
dehydrate<00:08:14.819> a<00:08:15.210> food<00:08:15.479> in<00:08:15.689> the<00:08:15.779> old<00:08:15.930> days<00:08:16.229> hope<00:08:16.740> it

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 
dehydrate a food in the old days hope it

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:19.279 
dehydrate a food in the old days hope it
helps
