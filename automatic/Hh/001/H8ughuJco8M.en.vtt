00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello and today in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.260
 teach the recipe to make some 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.590
 delicious ham croquettes 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.570
 we are going to need ham of course 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.749
 This will buy next and 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.279
 minced in little place well I usually use 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:24.609
 for about 150 200 grams of ham a 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.449
 liter of milk 5 tablespoons flour 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:31.089
 medium wheat onion 2 or 3 teaspoons 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.580
 of butter and then for the batter 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.580
 a couple of eggs and bread crumbs 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 we put a pan a little wide to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.809
 medium fire and let's take a couple of 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.910
 teaspoons of butter and we will leave 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.780
 let it melt little by little 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.540
 while we are going to put a saucepan on fire 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.440
 medium and we're going to throw milk into it 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.900
 to make the bechamel is always better 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.110
 add warm milk 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.239
 my advice to make ham croquettes 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.210
 is to add the ham and milk 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.210
 when we are heating it so that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.020
 so take all the flavor of the ham and be 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.340
 much more delicious our croquettes 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.950
 while we are heating the milk 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.990
 when we see that the butter already 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.810
 has melted we are going to throw the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.690
 onion like that in segments and let's go 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.530
 letting it be done little by little 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.900
 at medium heat 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.880
 and of course do not forget about the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.060
 milk that we are heating up from 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.130
 watch her so she does not burn when 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.979
 let's see that the onion is already made 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.520
 that has taken color let's add the 5 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.210
 tablespoons of flour well well well 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.210
 groceries 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.400
 and we are going to go around 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.070
 continuously so that we do not burn 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.650
 of agreement but that is cooked that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.140
 toast just a tad that flour 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.540
 lose this white color that has and is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 so put a little more yellow 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.110
 then we turn away from the fire 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.180
 well as you can see the flour has already been 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.240
 cost a little bit and has a slight 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.040
 yellowish color but without burning this 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.530
 is done so that you place them you are not 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.680
 know then so much flour according 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.900
 good a typical bechamel now 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.230
 I would have to add little by little 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.330
 the milk and go stirring, but I 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.360
 I'm going to teach my way of doing what 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 it's perfect 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.400
 let's take our glass of the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.040
 mixer 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.120
 and we are very careful all the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.299
 pan flour 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.030
 Now let's put a colander on and 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.740
 let's spend all the milk so that the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.740
 ham to stay in the colander 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.930
 Now with a spoon we are going to remove it 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.870
 a little bit of agreement so that we are not 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.870
 get all the flour stuck down now 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.140
 optionally if you like the taste you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.840
 you can add a pinch of nutmeg 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.940
 or also of parsley is a very flavor 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.760
 good good then once removed 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.250
 we take out the spoon and we are going to crush 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.460
 very very good with our blender 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.620
 and once everything is well beaten we 're going to 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.360
 toss in a pan that can be the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.930
 same in which we have made the flour 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.260
 that is over medium-high heat and as you see 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.959
 here we have a perfect bechamel without 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.020
 lumps now we must go stirring a 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.110
 little bit and we will now add the 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.020
 ham that we had booked had been 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.780
 stayed in the colander and we must go 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.990
 stirring very well so that it gets together 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.690
 everything until we see that when moving it 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.350
 take off our bÃ©chamel from the bottom of the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.540
 skillet 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.510
 Well, as you can see, he has already expressed 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.850
 our bechamel and doing so with the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.310
 spatula rises practically all 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.680
 from the pan, well, now we set aside 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.680
 already from the fire 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.560
 and now we extend our mel visa 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.620
 any container a tray a 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.190
 dish a tupperware the important thing is that 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.350
 do not have a layer too thick for 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.870
 then be able to handle it better and that 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.240
 cool before now we will cover it with 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.490
 transparent phil paper and we will put 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 in the refrigerator a minimum of two or three 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.650
 hours until it's completely cold 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.550
 you can also make the mass of a day 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.580
 for other 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.470
 when the dough has cooled 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.950
 enough let's help us with some 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.410
 spoons to make our croquettes 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.050
 we will take a portion of our 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.650
 Bechamel and with the help of the other 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.250
 Spoon let's go dropping 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.220
 let's go leaving our croquettes in 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.160
 beaten egg and we're going to rebozando 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.490
 well remember that they are ham croquettes 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.160
 and we have not added any salt to the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.990
 bechamel therefore to the egg either 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.810
 because if we do not have too much 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.880
 salted with the salt of the ham that already 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.310
 it has built-in itself 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.460
 enough 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.790
 and after the egg we reboza mos in bread 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.520
 grated and for a double batter more 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.180
 crunchy we would first go through bread 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.820
 then for egg and again for bread in the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.700
 grated bread we finished giving it the shape 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.969
 that we want and then fry in oil 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.219
 very hot 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.249
 good the good thing that croquettes have 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:45.810
 if you want it once you can do it 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:48.389
 freeze to fry them later 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.190
 when we take them out of the pan the 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.770
 We put in a little dish where we have 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.770
 previously put on absorbent paper 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.320
 good and that's how we have our 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.980
 delicious croquettes of ham not me 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:08.180
 say you do not look good 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.180
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.180
 goodbye
