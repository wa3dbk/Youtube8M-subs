00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
shooter here it is another example that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
shooter here it is another example that
i'm<00:02:12.520> going<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.850> show<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.480> use<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.690> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
i'm going to show on the use of the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.840 
i'm going to show on the use of the
bridge<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.340> bit<00:02:15.460> more<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.670> a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
bridge this is a little bit more of a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.790 
bridge this is a little bit more of a
difficult<00:02:16.330> situation<00:02:16.450> whereas<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.350> have<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
difficult situation whereas you have a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.310 
difficult situation whereas you have a
ball<00:02:18.280> sit<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.700> front<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> cue<00:02:19.209> ball<00:02:19.320> and

ball sit in front of the cue ball and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.290 
ball sit in front of the cue ball and
you<00:02:20.380> try<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.620> reach<00:02:20.920> over<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.250> shoot<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
you try to reach over to shoot that you

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.880 
you try to reach over to shoot that you
shoot<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> cue<00:02:22.780> ball<00:02:22.840> into<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.260> tumult<00:02:23.590> in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
shoot the cue ball into the tumult in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.920 
shoot the cue ball into the tumult in
this<00:02:24.640> case<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.120> stand<00:02:25.390> your<00:02:25.540> bridge<00:02:25.720> on

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
this case you can stand your bridge on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.810 
this case you can stand your bridge on
the<00:02:25.959> end<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.010> bridge<00:02:30.010> up<00:02:30.340> as<00:02:30.610> close

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
the end you get this bridge up as close

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.979 
the end you get this bridge up as close
to<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.440> five<00:02:32.440> ball<00:02:32.650> as<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.780> keep<00:02:34.780> the

that's<00:02:48.640> important<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.209> know<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:50.200> your

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
that's important to know that if your

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.930 
that's important to know that if your
cue<00:02:50.709> ball<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.040> sent<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:51.610> come<00:02:51.820> in

cue ball is sent and then you come in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.850 
cue ball is sent and then you come in
contact<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.720> cue<00:02:52.930> ball<00:02:52.959> with<00:02:53.739> the

contact with the cue ball with the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.530 
contact with the cue ball with the
bridge<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.730> would<00:02:54.850> be<00:02:54.880> considered<00:02:55.450> it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
bridge then it would be considered it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.410 
bridge then it would be considered it
full<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.220> case<00:02:57.489> we're<00:02:57.760> at<00:02:57.910> me<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> had<00:02:58.360> the
