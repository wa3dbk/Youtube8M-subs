top of that slowly and turn it to the
other<00:04:34.660> side<00:04:35.310> see<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.490> nicely<00:04:36.759> cold<00:04:43.289> once<00:04:44.289> you

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
other side see it's nicely cold once you

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.680 
other side see it's nicely cold once you
do<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.340> stones<00:04:45.729> because<00:04:46.300> your<00:04:46.509> egg

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
do that you stones because your egg

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.200 
do that you stones because your egg
rings<00:04:47.020> may<00:04:47.319> be<00:04:47.380> very<00:04:47.770> hot<00:04:48.130> if<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.880> are<00:04:49.000> using

rings may be very hot if you are using
silicon<00:04:49.930> molds<00:04:50.349> it<00:04:50.470> doesn't<00:04:50.889> matter<00:04:51.069> so<00:04:51.789> your

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
silicon molds it doesn't matter so your

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.350 
silicon molds it doesn't matter so your
stones<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:52.840> shake<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.159> bit<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.580> take<00:04:55.150> the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
stones and shake it a bit and take the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.320 
stones and shake it a bit and take the
egg<00:04:55.539> ring<00:04:55.810> out<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:56.919> put<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.490> egg<00:04:57.639> ring<00:04:57.940> again

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
egg ring out so put the egg ring again

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.839 
egg ring out so put the egg ring again
on<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:59.680> pan<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.810> spray<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:02.080> bit<00:05:02.259> again<00:05:02.849> make

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
on the pan and spray it a bit again make

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.330 
on the pan and spray it a bit again make

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
sure you spray all the time if not it

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.629 
sure you spray all the time if not it
will<00:05:06.520> be<00:05:06.819> hard<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.810> take<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.440> veggie<00:05:09.130> patties

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
will be hard to take the veggie patties

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.800 
will be hard to take the veggie patties
out<00:05:09.849> so<00:05:10.720> press<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.259> down<00:05:11.500> like<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:15.509> you<00:05:16.509> can

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
out so press it down like that you can

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.379 
out so press it down like that you can
cook<00:05:17.139> all<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.770> mix<00:05:18.240> into<00:05:20.759> patties<00:05:21.759> like<00:05:21.789> this

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
cook all the mix into patties like this

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.589 
cook all the mix into patties like this
and<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.710> advantage<00:05:24.310> is<00:05:24.520> once<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.030> cook<00:05:25.300> this

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
and the advantage is once you cook this

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:31.050 
and the advantage is once you cook this
to<00:05:26.409> a<00:05:26.440> medium<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:29.500> can<00:05:29.770> store<00:05:30.550> this<00:05:30.729> in<00:05:30.940> the
