well<00:07:01.939> at<00:07:02.029> the<00:07:02.089> moment<00:07:02.239> but<00:07:02.479> I<00:07:02.569> think<00:07:02.749> the<00:07:02.839> more

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:03.019 
well at the moment but I think the more

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:04.929 
well at the moment but I think the more
the<00:07:03.259> more<00:07:03.439> the<00:07:03.589> results<00:07:03.949> come<00:07:04.159> the<00:07:04.639> more<00:07:04.849> the

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:04.939 
the more the results come the more the

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.549 
the more the results come the more the
confident<00:07:05.389> is<00:07:05.479> built<00:07:05.719> out<00:07:05.809> I<00:07:06.019> think<00:07:06.259> that<00:07:06.379> they

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
confident is built out I think that they

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.659 
confident is built out I think that they
could<00:07:06.619> yeah<00:07:06.919> I<00:07:06.949> think<00:07:07.189> they<00:07:07.309> can<00:07:07.459> matter

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
could yeah I think they can matter

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.999
