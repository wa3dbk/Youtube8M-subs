 first grade classmates and the teacher 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.330

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 what pitt up the board said yes 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.360
 you can is now let's say the concept 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.840
 what I wanted to convey to the children 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.980
 a little the message that good why 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 today they see you as 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.990
 a celebrity or someone who fulfills a dream 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.330
 but I was in the same place 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 were they then give a little 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.400
 message that really if they get 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.770
 objectives that can not can not 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.290
 fulfill this is in the place that this one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.450
 it depends on each one in the will 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.490
 you gain the strength that element in you is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.570
 identified or reflected in the guys 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.610
 let's tell you there that I was watching him 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.500
 at some point that apart I know 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 many children are friends of my children of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 here and I saw them and so quiet and quiet 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.820
 the truth is that they have behaved very well 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.290
 finally this one consulted the ones I ask 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.780
 also a message for the guys that 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.190
 they could not be in your talk but for 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.380
 now shalt send them a message of 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.170
 encouragement too many guys that maybe 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.240
 they are not studying they think about leaving the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.100
 study so they know the importance of 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.990
 education for the life of babies that 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.470
 is fundamental is one is the tool 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.600
 I think main to protect a boy 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.600
 Above all is to be prepared on 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.360
 learning to grow is the way of each 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.290
 life more than anything after can fulfill 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.740
 Dreams can work from 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.320
