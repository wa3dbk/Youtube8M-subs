being pressed together it will lower

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.820 
being pressed together it will lower
again<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.750> now<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> tungsten<00:01:43.170> blade<00:01:43.620> will

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
again and now the tungsten blade will

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.810 
again and now the tungsten blade will
begin<00:01:44.100> cutting<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.210> second<00:01:45.690> layer<00:01:46.820> let's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
begin cutting the second layer let's

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
begin cutting the second layer let's
start<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.930> starting<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.410> do<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.160> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
start now it's starting to do this and

start now it's starting to do this and
then<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.570> process<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.110> repeat<00:01:52.260> after

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
then again the process will repeat after

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.720 
then again the process will repeat after
the<00:01:53.010> cuts<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.430> made<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:54.660> glue<00:01:54.930> drop<00:01:55.200> its

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
the cuts are made the glue drop its

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
the cuts are made the glue drop its
droplets<00:01:56.730> will<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> dropped<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.480> in<00:01:57.660> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
droplets will be dropped just in the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.920 
droplets will be dropped just in the
places<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.170> they're<00:01:58.440> needed<00:01:59.630> another<00:02:00.630> sheet

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
places that they're needed another sheet

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.300 
places that they're needed another sheet
of<00:02:00.960> paper<00:02:01.230> will<00:02:01.470> be<00:02:01.590> brought<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310

that<00:02:21.600> came<00:02:21.780> out<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.080> machine<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.760> skull

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.229 

and<00:02:27.140> here's<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.189> model<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.849> we<00:02:28.939> were<00:02:29.030> just

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
and here's that model that we were just

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.059 
and here's that model that we were just
looking<00:02:29.599> at<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.530> CAD<00:02:30.739> screen<00:02:33.069> full

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
looking at on the CAD screen full

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.250 
looking at on the CAD screen full

machine this way here's a GIS model an M
cord<00:02:48.049> color<00:02:48.890> technology<00:02:50.650> colors<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.890> entire

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
cord color technology colors the entire

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.039 
cord color technology colors the entire
model<00:02:53.680> all<00:02:54.680> through<00:02:55.159> the<00:02:55.310> 3d<00:02:55.930> geometry<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
model all through the 3d geometry of the

model all through the 3d geometry of the
model<00:02:57.500> as<00:02:57.650> well<00:02:58.459> as<00:02:58.730> side<00:02:59.150> walls<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
model as well as side walls and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.990 
model as well as side walls and
overhangs<00:03:00.799> which<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.430> unique<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.909> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
overhangs which is unique in the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.449 
overhangs which is unique in the
industry<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.440> color<00:03:03.680> is<00:03:03.859> much<00:03:04.099> better

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
industry so the color is much better

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.849 
industry so the color is much better
it's<00:03:04.700> much<00:03:04.940> richer<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.629> consistent<00:03:06.349> its

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
it's much richer it's consistent its

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.830 
it's much richer it's consistent its
CMYK<00:03:07.549> plus<00:03:08.180> black<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.819> best<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
CMYK plus black and best of all the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.740 
CMYK plus black and best of all the
parts<00:03:12.290> are<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.920> one-fifth<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.909> cost<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.540> any

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
parts are a one-fifth the cost of any

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.330 
parts are a one-fifth the cost of any
other<00:03:14.989> technology<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.920> they're<00:03:16.129> made

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
other technology because they're made

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.030 
other technology because they're made
simply<00:03:16.819> from<00:03:17.000> paper<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.739> water<00:03:18.739> based

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
simply from paper and water based

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.860 
simply from paper and water based
adhesive<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.480> they're<00:03:20.720> also

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
adhesive and so they're also

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.030 
adhesive and so they're also
eco-friendly<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.959> check<00:03:24.170> out<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.620> emcore

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
eco-friendly so check out the emcore
