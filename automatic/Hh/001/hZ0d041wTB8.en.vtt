 not materialize withdrew the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 negotiations however it seems that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.039
 Warner has another offer but this time 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 eyes on 10 and comics the company 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.219
 your intention to make an offer this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.649
 same month of August and in case of 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.170
 materialize should acquire all time 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.360
 warner that includes warner bros in case 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 if this operation takes place, it says that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 all the characters have priority 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 of marvel all the characters of dc 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 comics and it could be with them what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 I would like 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.130
 they imagine a person avengers league 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.150
 of justice 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.250
 wow however how thr counts do not 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.530
 it is the only offer that has time warner 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.260
 since wang jianlin the richest man 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.910
 from china apple and google we also talk 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 all interest in taking over the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.230
 services company personally 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.690
 yes I would like to see that a league of the 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.610
 justice against the avengers we carry 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.130
 years saying that marvel is better than 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.470
 says comics is better now than what 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 demonstrate in a movie to me yes I 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.430
 like but I know that I know how to respect 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.440
 each character and they all act like 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.390
 such and did not give less time 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.070
 screen to none that all the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.710
 characters have the same time in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 screen like that so maybe it could be 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.490
 a bigger story than civil war and 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.130
 I do not know a thousand stories from the league 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.080
 justice or comics says but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think of some very big story and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
 spectacular could also be that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.900
 so many and dad says' come together and so 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.150
 I can follow our teams 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.340
 superheroes is far from happening 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.020
 something like that but I know a great movie if I 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 they did very well they will take their time 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.759
 in doing it and that gives a great impact that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.289
 it almost seems like it says comics 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.580
 was bought by Disney in the 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.770
 comments 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.400
 until the end and we'll see each other until 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.400
 next video
