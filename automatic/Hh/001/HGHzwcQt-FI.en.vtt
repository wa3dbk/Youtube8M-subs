00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 today we'll talk about variable strokes 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.899
 and from the first steps in its not given 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.670
 technology when a student comes to me on 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.530
 first lesson even if he's already there 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 As a play they were given as a rule, I ask 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.850
 say such a simple exercise like 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.380
 the rule 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:27.689
 I hear something here in this myth 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 the problem is that the left hand 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.810
 usually in a hurry that is here you can 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810
 hear 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.840
 but it's not even armed on video 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.870
 by eye 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:48.149
 that is, it sounds like this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 double click her in this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 situations do i propose to work on 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 pairs of fingers that is, at first instance, I 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.510
 take index and middle index 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.109
 because nameless pointers little finger and 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 the first time we work from the ear it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 pretty boring i'm warning but if 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 you will master it and it will be much easier for you 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.380
 and more pleasant then we start the index and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380
 average 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.340
 then accordingly then nameless 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.500
 city or little finger 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300
 we 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.050
 but 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.510
 detailed synchronization work is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.490
 not so quickly unfortunately it will require 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.440
 Well, how is this exercise up to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.210
 pairs one somewhere a couple of weeks 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.590
 naturally you don't know what two two 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.390
 weeks should do just that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.570
 certainly not about 15 minutes a day 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
 and that should be enough but your 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.790
 attention must be fully 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.990
 focused here on guitar otherwise then 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.240
 there is no letter tactics 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.250
 sit watch tv and type 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.930
 work out this topic does not roll 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.620
 further after when you mastered here 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.150
 this every patina is logical 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.660
 the continuation of this exercise is 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.660
 following 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.420
 there are three steps up by 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 grammar down 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.819
 and alternately 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.819
 but 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.300
 Naturally, if you immediately take these 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.010
 exercise even if the previous you 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.480
 turned out very cool you take 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.910
 Immediately everything starts to fall apart again 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.870
 out of sync and so on here again 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.240
 it will be necessary to sit 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.750
 work out to put it all together 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.980
 so that there were no such pieces for a long time 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.660
 the previous exercise we immediately from 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 classes do not throw away because she 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.400
 will still help and support you 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.590
 keep this sync in place 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.210
 next when we mastered it and we already 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.400
 can throw out the first exercise and 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.980
 the next step is this 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.980
 exercise with from changing positions 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.620
 here in fact everything is the same only we 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.780
 looking for a change in position want to draw your 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.370
 attention that the index finger comes 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.060
 time at the same time with a big here here 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.130
 such a thing first pointers then 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.580
 big happens you can see 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.580
 that thumb and back 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.640
 something like this
