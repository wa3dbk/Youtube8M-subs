00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.580
 See Daddy Good evening 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.010
 Today is as written in the title 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.530
 This I'm not writing after the type of fat you think I want to do we stand 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.510
 There also 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:22.630
 I wanted to be a Tri- pound like this before 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 It says Well, I was out If you only shop I would not shift suddenly in this place Well 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.590
 This came out 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.110
 blue is love 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 Well, a little stomach fraction Toka friend oh well I believe that now Necro Futsukurou 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.860
 I'm going to make the Verny t 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.120
 Well, I get along with empty-handed, etc. Pati not fart a little 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.120
 At first it looks like this 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 Oh 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.790
 Oh door one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.890
 Oops to be careful when doing this is to bend the card you have 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.410
 later 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:05.620
 If the sleeve of that card is to be a normal transparent sleeve 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.890
 It's good, but there is a ground path game or something 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:15.000
 Sign language that rider of such hurt already 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 I think it would be nice to cover people on this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:26.730
 I think that I often fail at the time of the first exercise until the rest 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:32.900
 I think it would be nice to do something on the 6th of the month 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.900

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.220

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.210
 Measure it like this 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.210
 It's hard to see with your finger 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.740
