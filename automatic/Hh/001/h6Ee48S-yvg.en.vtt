00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

I<00:00:00.060> want<00:00:00.390> to<00:00:00.480> point<00:00:00.719> out<00:00:00.930> an<00:00:01.170> important<00:00:01.500> point

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
I want to point out an important point

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.370 
I want to point out an important point
on<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.250> slide<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.700> that<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.149> rise<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:03.990> your

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
on the slide is that a rise in your

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
on the slide is that a rise in your
banned<00:00:04.740> neutrophils<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.430> particular<00:00:06.299> is

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
banned neutrophils in particular is

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.270 
banned neutrophils in particular is
particularly<00:00:07.140> indicative<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.890> bacterial

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
particularly indicative of bacterial

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.160 
particularly indicative of bacterial
infection<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.300> when<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.660> an<00:00:09.750> increase<00:00:10.139> in

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
infection so when we have an increase in

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.169 
infection so when we have an increase in
your<00:00:10.410> bands<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> CEG's<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.400> get<00:00:11.550> excited<00:00:12.030> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
your bands and CEG's we get excited and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.850 
your bands and CEG's we get excited and
we<00:00:12.240> say<00:00:12.389> okay<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.870> looks<00:00:13.110> like<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
we say okay this looks like a like a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.010 
we say okay this looks like a like a
shift<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> bacterial<00:00:15.000> end<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.540> definitely

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
shift to the bacterial end we definitely

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
shift to the bacterial end we definitely
get<00:00:16.080> excited<00:00:16.529> but<00:00:17.100> particularly<00:00:17.640> bands<00:00:18.240> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
get excited but particularly bands have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.179 
get excited but particularly bands have
a<00:00:18.900> lot<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.230> weight<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> that's<00:00:19.920> because<00:00:20.100> they

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a lot of weight and that's because they

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.550 
a lot of weight and that's because they
don't<00:00:20.340> belong<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.910> systemic<00:00:21.119> circulation

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
don't belong in the systemic circulation

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.820 
don't belong in the systemic circulation
so<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> patient<00:00:23.369> who<00:00:24.240> has<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.560> band

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
so if you have a patient who has a band

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
so if you have a patient who has a band
count<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:26.550> three<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.240> significant

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
count of two or three that's significant

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
count of two or three that's significant
if<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> patient<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> band<00:00:29.699> count<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
if you have a patient as a band count of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.900 
if you have a patient as a band count of
five<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.480> six<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:31.230> also<00:00:31.619> significant<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
five or six that's also significant but

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
five or six that's also significant but
if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> patient<00:00:33.750> who<00:00:34.079> has<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.290> band

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
if you have a patient who has a band

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.000 
if you have a patient who has a band
count<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.010> nine<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.170> ten<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.500> twelve

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
count of nine or you know ten or twelve

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.729 
count of nine or you know ten or twelve

you seeing patients who have band counts

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
you seeing patients who have band counts
you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> dozens<00:00:48.030> 12<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.539> higher<00:00:48.750> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you know in the dozens 12 or higher is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.090 
you know in the dozens 12 or higher is
pretty<00:00:49.710> low

you're<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> remember<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:51.000> patients

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you're going to remember those patients

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
you're going to remember those patients
in<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.719> clinical<00:00:52.050> practice<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.800> they

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
in your clinical practice because they

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.010 
in your clinical practice because they
are<00:00:53.039> very<00:00:53.190> few<00:00:53.550> okay<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.780> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
are very few okay so that's really

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
are very few okay so that's really
really<00:00:55.170> important<00:00:55.890> I'll<00:00:56.579> tell<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> story

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
just for a minute I was occasionally

just for a minute I was occasionally
will<00:00:59.820> review<00:01:00.090> medical<00:01:00.480> records<00:01:00.809> for

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
will review medical records for

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.820 
will review medical records for
attorneys<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> give<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.640> opinions<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.510> to

nursing standard of care so they they
want<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.810> opinion<00:01:07.080> about<00:01:07.470> whether<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this particular case when a child was

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.120 
this particular case when a child was
either<00:01:10.890> injured<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.330> died<00:01:12.890> was<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
either injured or or died was the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
either injured or or died was the
standard<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> care<00:01:14.820> followed<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.049> I'll

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
opinion I reviewed a case several years

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550 
opinion I reviewed a case several years
ago<00:01:20.330> involving<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.450> infant<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.960> older<00:01:22.200> infant

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
ago involving an infant an older infant

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
ago involving an infant an older infant
who<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.130> come<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> an<00:01:23.700> ER<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.390> RSV

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
who had come to an ER with RSV

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
who had come to an ER with RSV
with<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.860> appeared<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.250> RSV

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with what appeared to be RSV

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.149 
with what appeared to be RSV
bronchiolitis<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.650> believe<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
bronchiolitis and I believe that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
bronchiolitis and I believe that
everything<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> record

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
everything in the in the record

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.960 
everything in the in the record
indicated<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.860> patient<00:01:32.280> did<00:01:32.430> present

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
indicated that this patient did present

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.569 
indicated that this patient did present
with<00:01:33.630> RSV<00:01:34.200> bronchiolitis<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> that's<00:01:35.460> how

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
with RSV bronchiolitis and that's how

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
with RSV bronchiolitis and that's how
the<00:01:35.640> patient<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.150> treated<00:01:36.390> therefore<00:01:37.380> they

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the patient was treated therefore they

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.840 
the patient was treated therefore they
didn't<00:01:37.860> draw<00:01:37.950> CBC<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.520> differential

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
didn't draw CBC with differential

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.390 
didn't draw CBC with differential
because<00:01:39.180> normally<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.930> patient<00:01:40.770> who<00:01:40.860> who

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
died and the question was this patient

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.490 
died and the question was this patient
became<00:02:10.319> septic<00:02:11.270> with<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> major<00:02:12.599> major

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
Oh sepsis the question ultimately was

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.990 
Oh sepsis the question ultimately was
you<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.140> was<00:02:16.440> there<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.280> did<00:02:17.700> people

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you know was there you know did people

you know was there you know did people
miss<00:02:18.210> something<00:02:18.630> again<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.710> case<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
miss something again in this case I

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.380 
miss something again in this case I
don't<00:02:20.130> think<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.640> did<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
don't think that they did I think this

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
don't think that they did I think this
patient<00:02:21.630> had<00:02:22.040> rst<00:02:23.040> bronchiolitis

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670

and<00:02:23.850> unfortunately<00:02:24.600> developed<00:02:25.410> bacterial

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and unfortunately developed bacterial

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.950 
and unfortunately developed bacterial
sepsis<00:02:26.010> which<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.180> chasing<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.690> ball<00:02:27.840> down

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
sepsis which is like chasing a ball down

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720 
sepsis which is like chasing a ball down
the<00:02:28.110> hill<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.500> many<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> know<00:02:29.040> care<00:02:29.550> for

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the hill as many of you know care for

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.440 
the hill as many of you know care for
children<00:02:30.710> but<00:02:31.710> what<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.070> interesting<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
children but what was interesting in the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.300 
children but what was interesting in the
record<00:02:33.840> when<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.350> satin<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.860> met<00:02:35.070> with<00:02:35.190> his

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
record when I satin and met with his

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.550 
record when I satin and met with his
attorney<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.910> said<00:02:36.180> my<00:02:36.600> opinion<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
attorney I said my opinion is that the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
attorney I said my opinion is that the
standard<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> care<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.220> followed<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.850> said

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
standard of care was followed I said

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
standard of care was followed I said
however<00:02:39.870> when<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.740> patient<00:02:41.130> became<00:02:41.370> very<00:02:41.670> ill

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
however when the patient became very ill

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.840 
however when the patient became very ill
and<00:02:42.050> they<00:02:43.050> ultimately<00:02:43.260> draw<00:02:43.830> drew<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> CBC<00:02:44.670> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
and they ultimately draw drew a CBC and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.870 
and they ultimately draw drew a CBC and
a<00:02:45.390> blood<00:02:45.600> culture<00:02:45.870> when<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> CBC<00:02:47.430> came<00:02:47.640> back

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
a blood culture when the CBC came back

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.600 
a blood culture when the CBC came back
and<00:02:48.540> shortly<00:02:48.959> thereafter<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:50.040> patient<00:02:50.459> had<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
very high white cell count and the band

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.880 
very high white cell count and the band

count was 18 I've never taken care of a

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.030 
count was 18 I've never taken care of a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
patient with a band count of 18 okay and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.870 
patient with a band count of 18 okay and
I've<00:02:59.160> taken<00:02:59.250> care<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.550> lot<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.730> sick

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
I've taken care of a lot of sick

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.220 
I've taken care of a lot of sick
patients<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> work<00:03:00.660> with<00:03:00.840> labs<00:03:00.990> all<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
patients and I work with labs all the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890 
patients and I work with labs all the
time<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:02.640> was<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> very<00:03:03.180> high<00:03:03.420> bound<00:03:03.630> count

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
time this was a very high bound count

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.010 
time this was a very high bound count
and<00:03:04.050> very<00:03:04.440> significant<00:03:05.190> now<00:03:06.000> again<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.840> this

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
and very significant now again in this

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.860 
and very significant now again in this
situation<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.310> not<00:03:08.670> believe<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.390> they

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
situation I do not believe that they

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.260 
situation I do not believe that they
needed<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.410> draw<00:03:10.740> a<00:03:10.770> CBC<00:03:11.100> before<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:11.820> did<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
needed to draw a CBC before they did I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.880 
needed to draw a CBC before they did I
think<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.750> drew<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.110> CBC<00:03:13.500> when<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.770> was

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
think they drew the CBC when it was

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.820 
think they drew the CBC when it was
indicated<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.690> unfortunately<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.080> was<00:03:16.590> just

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
indicated and unfortunately it was just

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.949 
indicated and unfortunately it was just
a<00:03:16.920> little<00:03:17.100> bit<00:03:17.250> too<00:03:17.459> late<00:03:17.640> however<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.870> this

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
a little bit too late however and this

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.320 
a little bit too late however and this
is<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> message<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.980> had<00:03:20.730> someone<00:03:21.209> in

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
is the message for you had someone in

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.030 
is the message for you had someone in
the<00:03:21.420> ER<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.140> don't<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.500> they<00:03:22.620> needed<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the ER and I don't think they needed to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.930 
the ER and I don't think they needed to
I<00:03:23.070> don't<00:03:23.280> think<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.519> was<00:03:23.580> any<00:03:23.760> negligence

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
I don't think there was any negligence

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.210 
I don't think there was any negligence
but<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:25.019> someone<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> ER<00:03:25.590> looked<00:03:26.100> at

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
but it's someone in the ER looked at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.160
