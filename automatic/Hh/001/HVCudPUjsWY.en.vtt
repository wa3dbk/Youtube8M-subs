rep all that's gonna do is ensure you
get<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> full<00:01:26.790> range<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> motion<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.689> you're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
get the full range of motion and you're

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
get the full range of motion and you're
really<00:01:28.350> extending<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> bicep<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.490> the

maximum<00:01:30.090> length<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.159> last<00:01:32.159> tip<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
maximum length and last tip is if you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
maximum length and last tip is if you
flex<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.869> quads<00:01:34.229> slightly<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:35.159> actually

in gate lock your body in so it's a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.920 
in gate lock your body in so it's a
little<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.560> easier<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.630> lower<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.810> weight

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
little bit easier to lower the weight

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.319 
little bit easier to lower the weight
and<00:01:40.140> control<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.009> flex<00:01:41.579> 2<00:01:41.670> tricep<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and control the way so flex 2 tricep and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
and control the way so flex 2 tricep and
even<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.380> flex<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> tricep<00:01:44.100> flex

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
even here you can flex the tricep flex

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
even here you can flex the tricep flex
the<00:01:44.850> quad<00:01:45.090> slightly<00:01:45.570> focus<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> eccentric

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the quad slightly focus on the eccentric

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.609 
the quad slightly focus on the eccentric
which<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> lowering<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> weight<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
which is the lowering of the weight and

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.160 
which is the lowering of the weight and
yes<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.009> bicep<00:01:50.340> top<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.060> our<00:01:51.720> second

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
yes we use the bicep top so our second

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.149 
yes we use the bicep top so our second
exercise<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.820> reverse<00:01:54.630> easy<00:01:55.020> crowbar<00:01:55.500> now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
exercise is a reverse easy crowbar now

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
exercise is a reverse easy crowbar now
I'm<00:01:56.310> using<00:01:56.520> an<00:01:56.700> outside<00:01:56.909> grip<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.719> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I'm using an outside grip just so it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
I'm using an outside grip just so it
feels<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.229> natural<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.369> do

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
exercise we're just switching out that

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.460 
exercise we're just switching out that
cable<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.730> doing<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.910> straight<00:03:30.419> bar<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:31.260> this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
cable and doing a straight bar now this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.080 
cable and doing a straight bar now this
straight<00:03:31.709> bar<00:03:31.889> is<00:03:32.099> gonna<00:03:32.310> be<00:03:32.549> another<00:03:32.819> two

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
straight bar is gonna be another two

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.110 
straight bar is gonna be another two
sets<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:33.900> we're<00:03:34.380> doing<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.620> total<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.160> four<00:03:35.489> sets

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
sets so we're doing a total of four sets

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.180 
sets so we're doing a total of four sets
on<00:03:36.299> cable<00:03:36.720> work<00:03:36.870> alright<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.650> here<00:03:37.889> we<00:03:37.919> want<00:03:38.130> to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
on cable work alright so here we want to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.979 
on cable work alright so here we want to
go<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> little<00:03:38.489> bit<00:03:38.669> heavier<00:03:38.970> than<00:03:39.030> 12<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.419> 15<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
go a little bit heavier than 12 to 15 I

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.339 
go a little bit heavier than 12 to 15 I
would<00:03:40.470> say<00:03:40.799> go<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.010> 8<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.579> 10<00:03:41.730> reps<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.349> again

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
would say go for 8 to 10 reps here again

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.319 
would say go for 8 to 10 reps here again
lockout<00:03:44.069> at<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.549> very<00:03:44.730> bottom<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.239> you're

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
lockout at the very bottom so you're

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.569 
lockout at the very bottom so you're
really<00:03:45.720> forcing<00:03:46.500> your<00:03:46.560> triceps<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.220> squeeze

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
really forcing your triceps to squeeze

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.780 
really forcing your triceps to squeeze
and<00:03:47.989> let<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.169> cable<00:03:49.709> pull<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.099> tricep<00:03:50.430> up<00:03:50.609> so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and let the cable pull your tricep up so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.960 
and let the cable pull your tricep up so
like<00:03:50.970> gravity<00:03:51.650> really<00:03:52.650> work<00:03:52.919> with<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.910> you

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
like gravity really work with you so you

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.720 
like gravity really work with you so you
get<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.299> tension<00:03:54.690> on<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:54.840> tricep<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.730> here

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
get that tension on your tricep and here

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.030 
get that tension on your tricep and here
again<00:03:57.000> 8<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.450> 10<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.379> rope<00:03:58.530> about<00:03:58.650> 12

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
again 8 to 10 and on the rope about 12

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.559 
again 8 to 10 and on the rope about 12
to<00:03:59.160> 15<00:03:59.329> so<00:04:00.829> after<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:01.919> do<00:04:02.040> our<00:04:02.069> cable<00:04:02.579> work<00:04:02.730> here

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
to 15 so after we do our cable work here

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.000 
to 15 so after we do our cable work here
you<00:04:03.660> can<00:04:03.780> kind<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:03.989> see<00:04:04.169> an<00:04:04.470> update<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.829> where

actually the biggest portion of the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.240 
actually the biggest portion of the
tricep<00:04:46.180> and<00:04:46.600> any<00:04:47.110> overhead<00:04:47.590> movement<00:04:48.130> is

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
tricep and any overhead movement is

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.150 
tricep and any overhead movement is
really<00:04:48.550> gonna<00:04:49.590> specifically<00:04:50.590> target<00:04:51.010> that

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
really gonna specifically target that

but<00:05:06.130> um<00:05:06.280> I'd<00:05:06.490> really<00:05:06.670> try<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:06.970> rotate<00:05:07.240> my

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570
