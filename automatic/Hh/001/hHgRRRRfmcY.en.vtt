00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.319
 the drift by someone if this team's 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.629

 gomez 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.060
 let's see by hearing the value of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.990
 guadarrama has the possibility of 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.080
 arrive to shoot metal shots 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.810

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.900
 wind 5 of the first time is winning 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.870

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.460

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.570
 elevator hands forward with carlos 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.940
 stolen therefore looking for the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.370
 horizon the unmarked companion ball 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 the brazilian was looking for her 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.850
 necaxa team the header 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.520

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.320

 players experience here danger sonny 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.470
 guadarrama with the possibility of 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.630
 attention this may be for Merida 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.130
 they are and I try to dry out demarcation it 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.130

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.550
 carefully 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.010
 an encounter that seemed to have 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.769
 something more in the sense that the goal was 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.630
 early to the minute 5 through 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.430
 dean sonny guadarrama the auction of 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.440
 head up and I think it has been 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.320

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.090
 right here this causes you let's see 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.530

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.550
 possibility that this one the Brazilian comes out 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.550
 the goalie let's see 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.499

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.349
 drift and in this instant the main 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:54.379
