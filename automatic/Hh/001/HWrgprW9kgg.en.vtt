00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
five I'd have found once or twice that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.750 
five I'd have found once or twice that
if<00:03:07.390> I<00:03:07.540> kind<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.989> mess<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.319> up<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.830> gets<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.310> little

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
if I kind of mess it up it gets a little

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.720 
if I kind of mess it up it gets a little
bit<00:03:10.230> kind<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.560> breaks<00:03:11.890> up<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.220> little<00:03:12.610> bit

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
bit kind of it breaks up a little bit

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.280 
bit kind of it breaks up a little bit
but<00:03:12.940> that's<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.269> if<00:03:13.390> I'm<00:03:13.510> touching<00:03:13.959> my<00:03:14.080> face

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290

not totally their problem application

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.830 
not totally their problem application
super<00:03:18.610> easy<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.940> apply<00:03:19.150> because<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.810> a

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
super easy to apply because it is a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.710 
super easy to apply because it is a
pencil<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.859> is<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.430> have<00:03:21.640> used<00:03:21.850> thinner<00:03:22.180> pencils

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
pencil it is I have used thinner pencils

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.259 
pencil it is I have used thinner pencils
as<00:03:22.840> well<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.200> thicker<00:03:23.470> pencil<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.160> easier<00:03:24.910> it

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
as well the thicker pencil is easier it

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.800 
as well the thicker pencil is easier it
makes<00:03:25.299> for<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.290> much<00:03:26.560> more<00:03:27.090> defined<00:03:28.090> area<00:03:28.600> than

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
makes for a much more defined area than

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.000 
makes for a much more defined area than
the<00:03:28.930> thinner<00:03:29.140> ones<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.440> thinner<00:03:29.650> ones<00:03:29.829> looks

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
the thinner ones the thinner ones looks

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.530 
the thinner ones the thinner ones looks

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
don't know how you would actually

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.470 
don't know how you would actually
package<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.650> mean<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.030> what<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.269> is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
package this I mean it is what it is

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.270

it's<00:03:40.690> exactly<00:03:41.109> how<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.320> should<00:03:41.590> be<00:03:41.709> packaged<00:03:42.130> I

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
it's exactly how it should be packaged I

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800 
it's exactly how it should be packaged I
can't<00:03:42.489> imagine<00:03:42.579> any<00:03:42.970> other<00:03:43.060> way<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.420> package

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
can't imagine any other way to package

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.110 
can't imagine any other way to package
it<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.140> packaging<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.739> good<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.700> 5<00:03:45.970> out

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it so packaging is a good you know 5 out

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.900 
it so packaging is a good you know 5 out
of<00:03:46.150> 5<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.380> should<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.709> price<00:03:48.700> on

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
of 5 it is what it should be price on

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.860 
of 5 it is what it should be price on
this<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.299> $23<00:03:50.230> um<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:52.269> it's<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.510> three<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.810> a

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
this it's $23 um so it's a three and a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
this it's $23 um so it's a three and a
half<00:03:53.019> out<00:03:53.170> of<00:03:53.200> five<00:03:53.290> it's<00:03:53.620> neither<00:03:53.769> here<00:03:54.100> nor

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
half out of five it's neither here nor

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.090 
half out of five it's neither here nor
there<00:03:54.570> I'll<00:03:55.570> pay<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.989> because<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.350> love<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.560> but
