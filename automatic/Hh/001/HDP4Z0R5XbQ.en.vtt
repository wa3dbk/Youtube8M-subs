like they lost from level 90 to 100 you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500 
like they lost from level 90 to 100 you
can<00:00:19.650> only<00:00:19.800> equip<00:00:20.160> from<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.490> level<00:00:20.880> 90<00:00:21.210> but

these<00:00:21.720> how<00:00:21.960> item<00:00:22.560> level<00:00:22.650> 5<00:00:22.949> 60<00:00:23.430> ones<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
these how item level 5 60 ones and I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.019 
these how item level 5 60 ones and I
assume<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.470> scale<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
assume that they will scale up as you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
assume that they will scale up as you
level<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.109> know<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> next

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
level so you know when the next

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 
level so you know when the next
expansion<00:00:28.949> comes<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.609> you'll<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.090> level

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
expansion comes out you'll be like level

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
expansion comes out you'll be like level
91<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.140> it'll<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.529> item<00:00:31.859> level<00:00:32.040> 5

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

maybe at level 95 the boa is scaled up

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
maybe at level 95 the boa is scaled up
and<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.689> could<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.200> decent<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.220> know

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and they could be pretty decent you know

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
and they could be pretty decent you know
it<00:01:44.460> could<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> pretty<00:01:44.759> decent<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.299> could<00:01:45.450> be

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it could be pretty decent they could be

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.730 
it could be pretty decent they could be
really<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:46.110> who<00:01:46.409> knows<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.710> might

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
really really good who knows they might

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889 
really really good who knows they might
be<00:01:46.979> best<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.430> slots<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.970> doubt<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.540> though

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
be best in slots I doubt it though

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
be best in slots I doubt it though
because<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.320> doesn't<00:01:49.530> seem<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> kind

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
because that doesn't seem like the kind

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
because that doesn't seem like the kind
of<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.520> Blizzard<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.960> yes

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
of thing that Blizzard would do but yes

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
of thing that Blizzard would do but yes
you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.560> normal<00:01:52.890> version<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.340> heroic

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you can get normal version or heroic

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
you can get normal version or heroic
version<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.180> only<00:01:54.390> drop<00:01:54.720> from<00:01:54.899> gurage<00:01:55.200> none

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
version they only drop from gurage none

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.760 
version they only drop from gurage none
of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:56.070> bosses<00:01:56.340> drop<00:01:57.299> these<00:01:57.659> boa<00:01:58.259> items

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
of the other bosses drop these boa items

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
of the other bosses drop these boa items
that<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.369> none<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that I can see none of them so if you

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.690 
that I can see none of them so if you
want<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> boa<00:02:01.920> items<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.579> gonna

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
have to go and kill garrosh a lot a lot

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.550 
have to go and kill garrosh a lot a lot
a<00:02:05.100> lot<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.750> now<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> even<00:02:07.110> carry<00:02:07.290> kill

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a lot a lot now you can even carry kill

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.199 
a lot a lot now you can even carry kill
em<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.799> multiple<00:02:08.250> tunes<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.759> send<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
em on multiple tunes and send the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
em on multiple tunes and send the
different<00:02:09.989> items<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.530> different<00:02:10.860> characters

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
different items to different characters

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.020 
different items to different characters
they<00:02:11.489> aren't<00:02:11.819> tokens<00:02:12.300> or<00:02:12.420> anything

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
they aren't tokens or anything

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.780 
they aren't tokens or anything
so<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.260> know<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.500> right<00:02:14.770> boa<00:02:15.130> or<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.520> boa

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
so you know the right boa or the boa

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.210 
so you know the right boa or the boa
that<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.209> are<00:02:16.420> after<00:02:16.600> may<00:02:17.260> not<00:02:17.500> drop<00:02:17.980> which

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
that you are after may not drop which

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.120 
that you are after may not drop which
has<00:02:18.400> been<00:02:18.640> unfortunate<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.980> do

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
has been unfortunate but what can you do

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.410 
has been unfortunate but what can you do
right<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.819> how<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.360> work

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
right that's just how it's going to work

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.050 
right that's just how it's going to work
and<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.680> kind<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.069> like<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.400> idea<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.760> they

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and I do kind of like the idea that they

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.300 
and I do kind of like the idea that they
are<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.660> be<00:02:25.780> items<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:26.920> you're<00:02:27.040> going

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
are going to be items that you're going

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.150 
are going to be items that you're going
to<00:02:27.430> need<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.730> use<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:28.540> also<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.920> just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
to need to use but they also are just

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
to need to use but they also are just
good<00:02:30.340> for<00:02:30.520> boa<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.330> well<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.989> going

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
good for boa is as well that it's going

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.420 
good for boa is as well that it's going
to<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.350> little<00:02:32.590> bit<00:02:32.739> weird<00:02:33.100> when<00:02:33.310> you're

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
to be a little bit weird when you're

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.790
