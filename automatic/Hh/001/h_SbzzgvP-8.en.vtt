00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and lots of little strokes kind of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.670 
and lots of little strokes kind of
covering<00:01:59.009> most<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> carapace<00:02:00.680> you'll

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
covering most of the carapace you'll

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.510 
covering most of the carapace you'll
want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:03.170> not<00:02:04.170> worry<00:02:04.590> yourself<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:05.310> the

final outcome of it right now in fact
what<00:02:09.330> you're<00:02:09.420> doing<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.679> getting<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what you're doing is just getting that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.570 
what you're doing is just getting that
blue<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.730> there

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
blue on there

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
blue on there
and<00:02:12.670> you'll<00:02:12.850> be<00:02:12.970> shaping<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.630> with<00:02:14.020> some

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and you'll be shaping that with some

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.230 
and you'll be shaping that with some
black<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.830> fortress<00:02:18.520> gray<00:02:18.760> or

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I guess in my case the fortress gray

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.720 
I guess in my case the fortress gray

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
quick do get the edges make sure that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.030 
quick do get the edges make sure that
that<00:02:36.910> blue<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.390> nice<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.950> solid<00:02:39.790> looking<00:02:41.040> go

that blue is nice and solid looking go

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.790 
that blue is nice and solid looking go
back<00:02:42.220> over<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> few<00:02:42.820> points<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.680> can

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
back over a few points and as you can

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.480 
back over a few points and as you can
see<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.460> looks<00:02:45.910> very<00:02:46.270> rough<00:02:46.930> there's<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.950> lot<00:02:48.370> of

and<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:10.120> going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:11.550> only<00:03:12.550> paint<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:13.470> small

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and I'm going to only paint a small

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.090 
and I'm going to only paint a small
amount<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:16.000> section<00:03:16.480> black<00:03:17.200> what<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.709> want<00:03:17.980> what

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
amount of section black what I want what

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
amount of section black what I want what
I'm<00:03:18.250> doing<00:03:18.519> now<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:19.060> uh<00:03:20.340> making<00:03:21.340> these<00:03:21.640> lines

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
I'm doing now is uh making these lines

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.160 
I'm doing now is uh making these lines
that<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.019> lines<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.680> make<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.040> feel<00:03:24.280> organic

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that the lines that make it feel organic

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.890 
that the lines that make it feel organic
much<00:03:26.170> sharper<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:27.550> I'm<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.540> gonna<00:03:28.690> do<00:03:28.870> that

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
much sharper so I'm not gonna do that

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.720 
much sharper so I'm not gonna do that
much<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:29.890> paint<00:03:30.100> backwards<00:03:30.580> like

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
much but if you paint backwards like

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.330 
much but if you paint backwards like
this<00:03:30.970> it'll<00:03:31.209> make<00:03:31.330> many<00:03:31.690> sharp<00:03:32.470> triangular

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
this it'll make many sharp triangular

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130 
this it'll make many sharp triangular
points<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.209> that's<00:03:34.570> what<00:03:34.780> I'm<00:03:34.840> doing<00:03:35.110> now

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
points so that's what I'm doing now

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
points so that's what I'm doing now
round<00:03:36.070> out<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.370> edges<00:03:40.920> shouldn't<00:03:41.920> take<00:03:42.130> too

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
round out the edges shouldn't take too

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.820 
round out the edges shouldn't take too
long<00:03:42.340> guys<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.600> know<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> couple<00:03:43.959> seconds<00:03:44.470> here
