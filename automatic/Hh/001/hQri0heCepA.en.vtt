know<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.519> cool<00:00:08.670> things<00:00:09.000> about

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
know one of the cool things about

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
know one of the cool things about
turbine<00:00:09.719> engines<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.469> everything's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
turbine engines is that everything's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.799 
turbine engines is that everything's
spinning<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> same<00:00:11.940> direction<00:00:12.150> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
spinning in the same direction so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.350 
spinning in the same direction so
they're<00:00:13.080> smoother<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.490> lot<00:00:14.670> more<00:00:14.880> durable

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
they're smoother and a lot more durable

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.939 
they're smoother and a lot more durable
than<00:00:15.540> pits<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.960> engines<00:00:16.379> where<00:00:16.529> everything

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
than pits and engines where everything

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.130 
than pits and engines where everything
is<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.310> back<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> forth<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.330> pistons<00:00:18.990> are

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
is going back and forth and pistons are

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
is going back and forth and pistons are
slapping<00:00:19.619> around<00:00:19.949> at<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> mile<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.609> minute<00:00:20.760> but

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
slapping around at a mile a minute but

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.179 
slapping around at a mile a minute but
that<00:00:21.449> doesn't<00:00:21.990> mean<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.170> turbine<00:00:22.800> engines

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that doesn't mean that turbine engines

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.640 
that doesn't mean that turbine engines

a<00:01:58.150> pt6<00:01:59.050> works<00:01:59.350> now<00:02:00.040> we're<00:02:00.220> going<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.369> take<00:02:00.580> a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
a pt6 works now we're going to take a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.240 
a pt6 works now we're going to take a
look<00:02:00.880> at<00:02:01.090> how<00:02:01.330> their<00:02:01.570> overhaul<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:03.040> first

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
look at how their overhaul the first

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.190 
look at how their overhaul the first
step<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.580> received<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> engine<00:02:04.360> from<00:02:05.170> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
step is received the engine from the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.650 
step is received the engine from the
customer<00:02:05.740> put<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.250> an<00:02:06.369> engine<00:02:06.660> disassembly

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
customer put on an engine disassembly

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.650 
customer put on an engine disassembly
stamp<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.610> take<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.820> disassembly<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
stamp and take it to disassembly the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.170 
stamp and take it to disassembly the
engine<00:02:11.650> gets<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.070> assemble<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.730> every<00:02:12.970> nut

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

every bolt every war every gasket
everything<00:02:16.510> comes<00:02:16.720> apart<00:02:17.010> after<00:02:18.010> disassembly

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
everything comes apart after disassembly

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.070 
everything comes apart after disassembly
the<00:02:18.970> engine<00:02:19.270> goes<00:02:19.420> through<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> cleaning

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the engine goes through a cleaning
