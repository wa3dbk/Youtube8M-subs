00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
these 1 by 1 squares of little rabbit

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.830 
these 1 by 1 squares of little rabbit
parts<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:22.260> top<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:24.000> then<00:00:24.269> attach<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
parts on top and then attach the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.589 
parts on top and then attach the
one-bite<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> side<00:00:26.789> bar<00:00:27.029> onto<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
one-bite you with the side bar onto that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.339 
one-bite you with the side bar onto that
there<00:00:28.010> I'm<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.220> build<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.760> these<00:00:30.349> each

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
there I'm gonna build two of these each

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.010 
there I'm gonna build two of these each
one<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> leg<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.809> once<00:00:36.809> both

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
one of them is a leg and then once both

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.560 
one of them is a leg and then once both
these<00:00:37.200> sure<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.559> completed<00:00:39.559> like<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
these sure are completed like so

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
these sure are completed like so
well<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:42.719> attach<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:44.870> rounded<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.950> bite<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
well then attach the rounded to bite you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
well then attach the rounded to bite you
plate<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> bottom<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.210> help

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
plate to the bottom and that will help

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.939 
plate to the bottom and that will help
keep<00:00:52.230> things<00:00:52.559> stable<00:00:54.710> can<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> little

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
keep things stable can be a little

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
keep things stable can be a little
tricky<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:57.449> attaching<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.170> bottom

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
tricky here when attaching the bottom

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.760 
tricky here when attaching the bottom
half<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.359> what's<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> upper<00:01:01.170> part<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
half of it what's it the upper part of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.840 
half of it what's it the upper part of
the<00:01:01.859> structure<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.789> be

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the structure is on there will be

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.420 
the structure is on there will be
secured<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.650> bite<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> played<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.489> the
