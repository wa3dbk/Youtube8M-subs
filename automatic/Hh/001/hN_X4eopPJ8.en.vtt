00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.840 
really smart and reads a lot of books
but<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.680> I<00:00:38.860> had<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.040> see<00:00:39.280> what<00:00:39.430> my<00:00:39.580> favorite

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
but if I had to see what my favorite

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.210 
but if I had to see what my favorite
movie<00:00:40.360> was<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:40.989> would<00:00:41.350> probably<00:00:41.620> pick

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
movie was I would probably pick

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.180 
movie was I would probably pick
something<00:00:42.699> that's<00:00:43.020> generally<00:00:44.020> popular<00:00:44.800> such

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
something that's generally popular such

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.840 
something that's generally popular such
as<00:00:45.489> back<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.660> future<00:00:47.080> are<00:00:47.470> Indiana<00:00:48.010> Jones

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.990 

I<00:00:53.050> think<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.230> easiest<00:00:54.500> Nancy<00:00:55.250> Drew<00:00:55.460> game<00:00:55.730> is

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
I think the easiest Nancy Drew game is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.509 
I think the easiest Nancy Drew game is
probably<00:00:56.329> Nancy<00:00:57.140> Drew<00:00:57.410> preacher<00:00:57.949> at<00:00:58.100> pappu

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
probably Nancy Drew preacher at pappu

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.970 
probably Nancy Drew preacher at pappu
cave<00:00:58.960> because<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.109> one<00:01:00.289> of<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.500> shorter

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
cave because it's one of the shorter

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.610 
cave because it's one of the shorter
games<00:01:01.250> in<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.579> series<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:02.719> shorts<00:01:03.289> and<00:01:03.500> the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
games in the series it shorts and the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.249 
games in the series it shorts and the
puzzles<00:01:04.009> aren't<00:01:04.280> too<00:01:04.519> difficult<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.869> puzzles

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
puzzles aren't too difficult the puzzles

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.440 
puzzles aren't too difficult the puzzles
are<00:01:06.350> long<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.979> takes<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.280> long<00:01:07.430> time<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.790> do<00:01:08.119> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
are long it takes a long time to do the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.399 
are long it takes a long time to do the
what<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.470> call<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.680> puzzle<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.460> paths

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
what do you call that puzzle the paths

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.039 
what do you call that puzzle the paths
sasquatch<00:01:12.610> depressed<00:01:13.610> yeah<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.600> have<00:01:14.840> to

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
sasquatch depressed yeah you have to

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.830 
sasquatch depressed yeah you have to
sort<00:01:15.649> the<00:01:15.860> trash<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.759> game<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.780> a

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
sort the trash in that game it's a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.749 
sort the trash in that game it's a
really<00:01:18.080> long<00:01:18.470> puzzle<00:01:18.979> but<00:01:19.399> it's<00:01:19.460> not<00:01:19.729> a

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
really long puzzle but it's not a

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.120 
really long puzzle but it's not a
difficult<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.320> that's<00:01:21.530> why<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.710> think<00:01:21.830> it's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
difficult one so that's why I think it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.550 
difficult one so that's why I think it's
the<00:01:22.340> easiest<00:01:22.670> game<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.899> puzzles<00:01:24.289> are<00:01:24.380> rather

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the easiest game the puzzles are rather

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950 
the easiest game the puzzles are rather
easy<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.789> rather<00:01:25.970> short<00:01:26.270> gain<00:01:26.600> it's

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
easy and it's a rather short gain it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.830 
easy and it's a rather short gain it's
probably<00:01:27.670> one<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.880> quickest<00:01:29.300> ones<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.720> get

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
probably one of the quickest ones to get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.130 
probably one of the quickest ones to get
through<00:01:30.399> also<00:01:31.399> Nancy<00:01:32.360> Drew<00:01:32.509> secrets<00:01:32.929> can<00:01:33.080> kill

can definitely beat it in under an hour
as<00:01:41.020> for<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.050> hardest<00:01:42.500> Nancy<00:01:42.890> Drew<00:01:43.069> game<00:01:44.200> I'm

Drew game they they're all pretty tough

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.490 
Drew game they they're all pretty tough
hmm<00:01:50.959> I<00:01:51.909> think<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.179> might<00:01:53.420> go<00:01:53.630> with<00:01:53.810> Nancy<00:01:54.259> Drew

hmm I think I might go with Nancy Drew
white<00:01:54.860> wolf<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.280> Icicle<00:01:55.789> Creek<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.330> then

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
white wolf of Icicle Creek and then

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.770

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
might also go for Nancy Drew shadow at

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.929 
might also go for Nancy Drew shadow at
the<00:01:59.810> water's<00:01:59.960> edge<00:02:00.460> because<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> had<00:02:01.729> those

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
the water's edge because it had those

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.929 
the water's edge because it had those
really<00:02:02.390> long<00:02:02.719> complicated<00:02:03.289> puzzles<00:02:03.950> such<00:02:04.700> as

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
the Barbie riding club game was for my

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.090 
the Barbie riding club game was for my
sister<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.210> one<00:02:47.840> day<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.050> got<00:02:48.290> bored<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:48.890> I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
sister and one day I got bored so I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.070 
sister and one day I got bored so I
decided<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.790> play<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.670 

I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:57.040> overall<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.690> mixed<00:02:59.050> bag<00:02:59.110> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
I think overall it's a mixed bag and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.530 
I think overall it's a mixed bag and
each<00:02:59.860> game<00:03:00.250> seems<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.790> have<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> mixture<00:03:01.420> of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
each game seems to have a mixture of

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.840 
each game seems to have a mixture of
characters<00:03:02.110> which<00:03:02.350> look<00:03:02.710> good<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.280> characters

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
characters which look good in characters

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.690 
characters which look good in characters
which<00:03:04.090> don't<00:03:04.480> look<00:03:04.660> good<00:03:04.810> at<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:06.280> example

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
which don't look good at all for example

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.820 
which don't look good at all for example

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
getting a real girl for a girlfriend

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.550 
getting a real girl for a girlfriend
until<00:03:45.880> he<00:03:46.390> met<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.720> very<00:03:46.930> beautiful<00:03:47.410> young

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
until he met that very beautiful young

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740 
until he met that very beautiful young
Irish<00:03:48.010> woman<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.400> cater<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.820> reception<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.720> I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
Irish woman you cater the reception so I

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.620 
Irish woman you cater the reception so I
guess<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.200> sort<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.530> balances<00:03:51.100> out<00:03:51.630> overall

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
guess that sort of balances out overall

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.930 
guess that sort of balances out overall
I<00:03:52.930> just<00:03:53.170> think<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.590> mixed<00:03:53.890> bag<00:03:53.940> some

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
I just think it's a mixed bag some

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
I just think it's a mixed bag some
characters<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.660> games<00:03:55.840> look<00:03:56.050> good<00:03:56.290> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
characters in the games look good and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.800 
characters in the games look good and
some<00:03:57.160> characters<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.790> games<00:03:58.000> look<00:03:58.330> not<00:03:58.780> so

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
some characters in the games look not so

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.980 
some characters in the games look not so
good

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.620 

I<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.460> funniest<00:04:05.910> thing<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.150> happen<00:04:06.390> to

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
last name but basically if you just

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.219 
last name but basically if you just
ignore<00:06:44.400> them<00:06:44.880> eventually<00:06:45.570> they<00:06:45.750> get<00:06:45.900> bored

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
ignore them eventually they get bored

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.770 
ignore them eventually they get bored
and<00:06:46.470> go<00:06:46.560> away<00:06:46.970> or<00:06:47.970> at<00:06:48.090> least<00:06:48.120> that's<00:06:48.540> what<00:06:48.750> I

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
and go away or at least that's what I

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.570 
and go away or at least that's what I
did<00:06:49.080> whenever<00:06:49.350> people<00:06:49.710> are<00:06:50.010> really<00:06:50.250> bothering

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
did whenever people are really bothering

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.600 
did whenever people are really bothering
me<00:06:50.940> when<00:06:51.330> I<00:06:51.360> was<00:06:51.600> younger<00:06:52.160> I'm<00:06:53.160> not<00:06:53.400> sure

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
me when I was younger I'm not sure

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.219 
me when I was younger I'm not sure
that's<00:06:53.790> the<00:06:53.970> best<00:06:54.090> strategy<00:06:54.419> there<00:06:55.110> are

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
that's the best strategy there are

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.490 
that's the best strategy there are
probably<00:06:55.530> better<00:06:56.010> strategies<00:06:56.760> such<00:06:57.090> as

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
probably better strategies such as

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.990 
probably better strategies such as
seeking<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.590> help<00:06:58.620> of<00:06:58.950> an<00:06:59.070> adult<00:06:59.310> I<00:06:59.639> probably

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
seeking the help of an adult I probably

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.460 
seeking the help of an adult I probably
should<00:07:00.360> have<00:07:00.450> done<00:07:00.540> that<00:07:00.690> that<00:07:01.050> probably

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
should have done that that probably

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.580 
should have done that that probably
would<00:07:01.979> have<00:07:02.040> been<00:07:02.130> actually<00:07:03.000> a<00:07:03.300> much<00:07:04.110> smarter

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
would have been actually a much smarter

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.040 
would have been actually a much smarter
decision<00:07:05.250> rather<00:07:05.460> than<00:07:05.669> let<00:07:06.450> the<00:07:06.479> people<00:07:06.870> make

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
decision rather than let the people make

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.070 
decision rather than let the people make
fun<00:07:07.290> of<00:07:07.350> me<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:07.889> just<00:07:08.100> say<00:07:08.310> nothing<00:07:08.669> about<00:07:08.790> it

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
fun of me and just say nothing about it

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.290 
fun of me and just say nothing about it
that's<00:07:10.080> sort<00:07:10.410> of<00:07:10.470> what<00:07:11.160> people<00:07:11.550> want<00:07:12.090> you<00:07:12.270> to

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
that's sort of what people want you to

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.350 
that's sort of what people want you to
do<00:07:12.510> you<00:07:12.720> know<00:07:12.840> the<00:07:12.990> bullies<00:07:13.320> want<00:07:13.680> you<00:07:13.979> to<00:07:14.460> do

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
do you know the bullies want you to do

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.230 
do you know the bullies want you to do
nothing<00:07:15.630> they<00:07:16.289> don't<00:07:16.500> want<00:07:16.740> you<00:07:16.979> to<00:07:17.190> get<00:07:17.910> help

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
nothing they don't want you to get help

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.180 
nothing they don't want you to get help

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
forever and ever and you really

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.670 
forever and ever and you really
shouldn't<00:07:22.560> have<00:07:22.710> to<00:07:22.979> put<00:07:23.160> up<00:07:23.220> with<00:07:23.280> that<00:07:23.640> but

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
shouldn't have to put up with that but

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.230 
shouldn't have to put up with that but
that<00:07:25.680> was<00:07:25.919> my<00:07:26.100> strategy<00:07:26.370> that's<00:07:26.820> what<00:07:27.000> I<00:07:27.030> did

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
that was my strategy that's what I did

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.600 
that was my strategy that's what I did
when<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:27.419> was<00:07:27.510> a<00:07:27.690> kid<00:07:27.780> I<00:07:27.990> basically<00:07:28.350> just<00:07:29.070> did

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
when I was a kid I basically just did

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.420 
when I was a kid I basically just did
nothing<00:07:30.000> about<00:07:30.090> it<00:07:30.270> and<00:07:30.630> eventually<00:07:31.289> they<00:07:32.220> got

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
nothing about it and eventually they got

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.850 
nothing about it and eventually they got
bored<00:07:32.760> of<00:07:32.850> making<00:07:33.180> fun<00:07:33.360> of<00:07:33.390> my<00:07:33.600> name<00:07:33.630> and<00:07:34.260> they

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
bored of making fun of my name and they

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.840 
bored of making fun of my name and they
went<00:07:35.130> off<00:07:35.280> to<00:07:35.610> make<00:07:36.030> fun<00:07:36.210> of<00:07:36.270> somebody<00:07:36.539> else<00:07:36.840> so

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:37.850 
went off to make fun of somebody else so

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.129 
went off to make fun of somebody else so
that's<00:07:38.850> what<00:07:39.090> I<00:07:39.120> did<00:07:39.180> when<00:07:39.450> I<00:07:39.510> was<00:07:39.600> younger<00:07:39.930> and

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 
that's what I did when I was younger and

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:42.040 
that's what I did when I was younger and
I<00:07:40.229> had<00:07:40.410> to<00:07:40.500> put<00:07:40.680> up<00:07:40.710> with<00:07:40.800> bullying<00:07:41.340> I

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
I had to put up with bullying I

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.210 
I had to put up with bullying I
understand<00:07:43.050> there's<00:07:43.260> a<00:07:43.320> movement<00:07:43.620> going<00:07:44.010> on

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220

right now to stomp out bullying in our
schools<00:07:46.979> and<00:07:47.639> I<00:07:48.330> would<00:07:48.570> like<00:07:48.720> to<00:07:48.750> say<00:07:49.050> that<00:07:49.410> I

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 
schools and I would like to say that I

think I support this movement I don't

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.500 
think I support this movement I don't
know<00:07:52.650> much<00:07:52.889> about<00:07:53.039> it<00:07:53.220> but<00:07:53.520> I<00:07:53.639> definitely<00:07:53.850> like

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510 
know much about it but I definitely like

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.870 
know much about it but I definitely like
the<00:07:54.539> idea<00:07:55.050> of<00:07:55.110> getting<00:07:55.710> rid<00:07:56.010> of<00:07:56.039> bullying<00:07:56.550> in

the idea of getting rid of bullying in

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.409 
the idea of getting rid of bullying in
schools<00:07:57.830> bullying<00:07:58.830> is<00:07:59.070> really<00:07:59.430> horrible<00:07:59.669> it's

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419
