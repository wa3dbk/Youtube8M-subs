00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.240
 to be able to represent this function I have drawn two perpendicular axes 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.029
 graduated 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.490
 I live here 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 the accused m6 is the crisis 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.509
 and then if the bce of cigarettes 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.359
 in fact it is on this axis 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 these images will be located 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 sometimes I will choose because to be able to plot the curve that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.520
 matches 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.190
 to the function 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.560
 I'm going is calculated the image 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 several of several places 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.610
 gold to start how his body - including three babies under three 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.370
 games calculation images 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 2 less than 3 years younger than 3 years 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 I'm applying the function of the function ser 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.590
 - 05 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590
 multiply by less than three years 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.080
 more than 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.880
 what makes me three times 05 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.870
 annual saturday I know that you suffer positive and 2 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.150
 percent a freak rain if they are negative so it was not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 gathered more than announce 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.170
 for the Russians 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.730
 picture 2-3 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
 these three viruses 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050
 therefore less than three years 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 for her will be 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.160
 I take of course 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.390
 pool lots to be as accurate as possible 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 the jurors 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 just follow the dotted players 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 which are drawn 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 but I have a first point 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 - 3 same three sources 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
 let's see the following points she 2-2 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.299
 using the same method I would find less damage on 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.039
 in three 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.359
 it is less and less 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.129
 equal 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.389
 stop two enemies 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.539

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.659

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.979

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.209
 ps2 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 a place on the 5th 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 and two 2 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 legal 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.579
 legal 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 well there I took some points 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.939
 she leads the game 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.939
 name me 3 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.689
 she asks for 5 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.889
 give me 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 of the hemicycle 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.169
 l 2 2 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 a data 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.929
 l 2 0 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.929

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.349
 ps2 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.219
 right here 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.219
 an enemy 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.539
 she became a half 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.539
 then 6 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.399
 she gives 3 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.399
 they must according to him 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.719
 the same me ourselves 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.719
 a long line 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.080
 we are here 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.409
 apparently more pointed shampoo placed 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.999
 they are bringing them back 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.439
 so the feeling of playing by keeping this race and it's surely a 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.349
 right 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.909
 later when we have studied 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.990
 more and more functions open and you will know more easily 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.909
 some families 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.559
 function 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.559
 here's one moreover that you're studying this year 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.689
 the feeling that we have thus multiplied each time the number of 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.050
 points I know we'll have them all aligned so we can think that 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.819
 the yard to get a straight calculation
