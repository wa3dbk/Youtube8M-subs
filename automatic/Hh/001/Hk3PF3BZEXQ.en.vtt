the<00:01:18.479> way<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the way I think about it when I want to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
the way I think about it when I want to
buy<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> game<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> same<00:01:21.150> way<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
buy a game is the same way is as when I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
buy a game is the same way is as when I
go<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> movies<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.580> example<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:24.180> buy<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
go to the movies for example or buy a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
go to the movies for example or buy a
song<00:01:24.840> how<00:01:25.259> much<00:01:25.500> enjoyment<00:01:25.920> am<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
song how much enjoyment am I going to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.030 
song how much enjoyment am I going to
get<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> thing<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.590> example

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
get out of that thing so for example

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
get out of that thing so for example
with<00:01:29.159> battlefield<00:01:29.520> 4<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.299> paid<00:01:30.950> $100

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
with battlefield 4 I paid $100

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.359 
with battlefield 4 I paid $100
Australian<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.630> 90<00:01:34.320> u.s.<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
Australian which is about 90 u.s. so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
Australian which is about 90 u.s. so
that's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> money<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.900> played<00:01:37.229> about

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
that's a lot of money but I played about

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
that's a lot of money but I played about
400<00:01:38.280> hours<00:01:38.400> 500<00:01:39.210> hours

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
400 hours 500 hours

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.130 
400 hours 500 hours
so<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.650> me<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.460> its<00:01:41.670> value<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.540> didn't<00:01:43.020> enjoy

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so to me it got its value I didn't enjoy

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.560 
so to me it got its value I didn't enjoy
the<00:01:43.409> game<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.640> terms<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.090> hours

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the game that much but in terms of hours

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
the game that much but in terms of hours
it<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:46.110> its<00:01:46.259> value

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it got its value

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.730 
it got its value
same<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.850> battlefield<00:01:48.210> 3<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.780> paid<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.200> 70

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
same with battlefield 3 I paid about 70

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
same with battlefield 3 I paid about 70
for<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.759> played<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> thousand<00:01:51.540> hours

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
for that and I played a thousand hours

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.899 
for that and I played a thousand hours
so<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> obviously<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.890> its<00:01:53.040> value<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.759> if

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so it obviously got its value like if

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.280 
so it obviously got its value like if
you're<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> movies<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.170> pay

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you're going to the movies and you pay

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.280 
you're going to the movies and you pay
$30.00<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> movie<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> enjoy<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
$30.00 see a movie then if you enjoy the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.770 
$30.00 see a movie then if you enjoy the
movie<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.860> good<00:01:59.040> value<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.759> that's<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> way

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
movie it's good value so that's the way

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.749 
movie it's good value so that's the way
I<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> sense<00:02:02.369> if

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I think about it so in that sense if

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
I think about it so in that sense if
you're<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.540> enjoy<00:02:03.840> hardline<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you're going to enjoy hardline and you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.679 
you're going to enjoy hardline and you
like<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.399> concept<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.630> do

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
like the concept of it which I do

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.020 
like the concept of it which I do
personally<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> whole<00:02:08.129> infantry<00:02:08.789> thing

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
personally like the whole infantry thing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
personally like the whole infantry thing
is<00:02:09.239> something<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.110> into<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.830> hate<00:02:11.280> being

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is something that I'm into I hate being

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.580 
is something that I'm into I hate being
killed<00:02:11.910> by<00:02:12.150> tanks<00:02:12.599> helis<00:02:13.020> all<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.470> those

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
killed by tanks helis all of those

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.940 
killed by tanks helis all of those
things

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
things

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890 
things
when<00:02:14.099> I'm<00:02:14.220> trying<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.180> ground<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
when I'm trying to play on the ground it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.570 
when I'm trying to play on the ground it
feels<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.410> when<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> try<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> play<00:02:17.069> conquest

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
feels like when I try to play conquest

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.570 
feels like when I try to play conquest
it's<00:02:17.879> just<00:02:18.209> impossible<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.050> having<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:20.040> game

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
it's just impossible so having a game

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
it's just impossible so having a game
where<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.060> infantry<00:02:21.720> centric<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.379> like

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
where it's infantry centric is like

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.540 
where it's infantry centric is like
perfect<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.310> me

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
perfect for me

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.520 
perfect for me
but<00:02:23.790> what's<00:02:23.970> perfect<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.569> me<00:02:24.959> might<00:02:25.319> not

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
but what's perfect for me might not

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.559 
but what's perfect for me might not
necessarily<00:02:25.800> be<00:02:26.400> perfect<00:02:26.819> for<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.060> right<00:02:27.300> so

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
necessarily be perfect for you right so

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.600 
necessarily be perfect for you right so
you<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.170> take<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.920> number<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.280> factors

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
you have to take in a number of factors

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.790 
you have to take in a number of factors
and<00:02:29.879> judge<00:02:30.180> whether<00:02:30.510> yourself<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.470> think

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and judge whether yourself you think

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.190 
and judge whether yourself you think
it's<00:02:32.069> worth<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.550> however<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.870> couple

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
it's worth it however I do have a couple

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.290 
it's worth it however I do have a couple
of<00:02:34.410> things<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.860> may<00:02:35.069> sway<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.640> opinion<00:02:36.120> one

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
of things that may sway the opinion one

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.420 
of things that may sway the opinion one
way<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.660> other<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.260> not<00:02:37.530> really<00:02:38.099> my

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
way or the other that's not really my

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.789 
way or the other that's not really my
goal<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.300> more<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.720> me<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:39.959> expressing

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
goal but it's more of me just expressing

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.729 
goal but it's more of me just expressing
my<00:02:41.370> opinions<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.180> specific<00:02:42.989> things<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.410> I've

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
my opinions on specific things so I've

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.380 
my opinions on specific things so I've
got<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.069> bit<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> list<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
got a little bit of a list here so I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.300 
got a little bit of a list here so I
will<00:02:45.599> read<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.049> off<00:02:46.230> now<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.830> headshot

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
will read them off now the headshot

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.339 
will read them off now the headshot
multipliers<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.030> huge<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.630> hardline<00:02:49.049> like

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
multipliers are huge in hardline like

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.960 
multipliers are huge in hardline like
I've<00:02:49.530> never<00:02:49.680> seen<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> battlefield<00:02:50.580> game

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
I've never seen it in a battlefield game

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.630 
I've never seen it in a battlefield game
to<00:02:51.239> where<00:02:51.450> you've<00:02:51.840> got<00:02:52.110> an<00:02:52.260> SMG<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.459> can

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
to where you've got an SMG and you can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.620 
to where you've got an SMG and you can
headshot<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> guy<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.959> an<00:02:55.140> ak-47<00:02:56.239> he<00:02:57.239> meters

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
headshot a guy with an ak-47 he meters

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.569 
headshot a guy with an ak-47 he meters
if<00:02:57.840> you've<00:02:58.230> got<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> aim<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> had<00:02:59.370> shot

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
if you've got the aim and you had shot

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.030 
if you've got the aim and you had shot
him<00:02:59.730> with<00:02:59.910> an<00:03:00.030> SMG<00:03:00.360> he's<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.860> he's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
him with an SMG he's down like he's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.039 
him with an SMG he's down like he's
absolutely<00:03:02.340> done<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.690> does

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
absolutely done so what that does

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.339 
absolutely done so what that does
essentially<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.310> makes<00:03:05.519> every<00:03:06.090> gun<00:03:06.690> viable

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
essentially is it makes every gun viable

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.800 
essentially is it makes every gun viable
in<00:03:07.500> previous<00:03:08.160> battlefield<00:03:08.640> games<00:03:08.910> it's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
in previous battlefield games it's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.839 
in previous battlefield games it's
always<00:03:10.230> been<00:03:10.530> about<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.069> assault<00:03:11.400> rifles

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
always been about the assault rifles

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.670 
always been about the assault rifles
because<00:03:12.090> they<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.720> short<00:03:13.019> medium<00:03:13.319> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
because they have the short medium and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.800 
because they have the short medium and
long<00:03:13.950> range<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:14.519> dominate<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.209> all<00:03:15.420> zones

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
long range they dominate in all zones

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
long range they dominate in all zones
and<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.799> made<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> pdws<00:03:17.849> irrelevant

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and that's what made the pdws irrelevant

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.759 
and that's what made the pdws irrelevant
because<00:03:18.660> there<00:03:18.989> were<00:03:19.079> only<00:03:19.109> good<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.560> short

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
because there were only good at short

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.830 
because there were only good at short
range<00:03:19.829> there<00:03:20.639> was<00:03:20.730> no<00:03:20.850> point<00:03:21.090> using<00:03:21.299> them<00:03:21.630> in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
range there was no point using them in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.379 
range there was no point using them in
this<00:03:22.350> game<00:03:22.650> every<00:03:23.310> single<00:03:23.639> gun<00:03:23.850> has<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> role

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
this game every single gun has a role

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.569 
this game every single gun has a role
and<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.780> love<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.590> really<00:03:26.100> just

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
and I love that it's really just

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.580 
and I love that it's really just
variants<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.510> what<00:03:28.109> is<00:03:28.260> better<00:03:28.470> than

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
variants and what is better than

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
variants and what is better than
variants<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.609> can<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:29.940> all<00:03:30.209> these

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
variants you can have all these

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
variants you can have all these
different<00:03:30.540> guns<00:03:31.109> in<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.410> game<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.980> head

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
different guns in the game like the head

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.250 
different guns in the game like the head
with<00:03:32.310> battlefield<00:03:32.579> 4<00:03:32.819> but<00:03:33.630> no<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.049> never

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
with battlefield 4 but no one was never

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.319 
with battlefield 4 but no one was never
using<00:03:34.680> them<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.130> what<00:03:35.430> this<00:03:35.579> does<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
using them so what this does is it

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.140 
using them so what this does is it
actually<00:03:36.480> gives<00:03:37.049> people<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.739> opportunity<00:03:38.150> to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
actually gives people the opportunity to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.270 
actually gives people the opportunity to
start<00:03:39.420> using<00:03:39.690> some<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.350> these<00:03:40.620> weapons

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
start using some of these weapons

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.699 
start using some of these weapons
now<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> second<00:03:42.180> beta<00:03:42.359> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.630> 870<00:03:43.260> Magnum

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
now in the second beta of the 870 Magnum

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.220 
now in the second beta of the 870 Magnum
was<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.700> strong<00:03:45.030> not<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.690> strong<00:03:45.959> but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
was really strong not just strong but

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.379 
was really strong not just strong but
almost<00:03:46.560> dopey<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.670> has<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> lot<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.180> do

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
almost dopey and that has a lot to do

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.759 
almost dopey and that has a lot to do
with<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.569> headshot<00:03:48.900> multiplier<00:03:49.019> but<00:03:49.590> more

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
with the headshot multiplier but more

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.710 
with the headshot multiplier but more
than<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.700> really<00:03:51.120> freaking

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
than that it's just really freaking

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.470 
than that it's just really freaking
powerful<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:53.130> thing<00:03:53.400> needs<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.760> nerf<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.269> my

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
powerful that thing needs a nerf in my

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.629 
powerful that thing needs a nerf in my
opinion<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.049> tried<00:03:55.590> using<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:56.040> slugs<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.519> it

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
opinion I tried using the slugs on it

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.190 
opinion I tried using the slugs on it
but<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.940> pretty<00:03:57.150> much<00:03:57.299> irrelevant<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.930> mean

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
but it's pretty much irrelevant I mean

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.379 
but it's pretty much irrelevant I mean
you<00:03:58.349> can<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.500> put<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:59.489> standard<00:03:59.910> Barrel<00:04:00.239> on

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
you can just put the standard Barrel on

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.780 
you can just put the standard Barrel on
it<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.959> works<00:04:01.230> fine<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:02.010> know<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.639> don't

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
it and it works fine you know you don't

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.789 
it and it works fine you know you don't
even<00:04:03.060> need<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.420> slugs<00:04:03.870> because<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.470> just

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
even need the slugs because it's just

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.710 
even need the slugs because it's just
that<00:04:04.920> strong<00:04:05.639> when<00:04:06.000> you're<00:04:06.150> taking<00:04:06.599> out

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
that strong when you're taking out

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.900 
that strong when you're taking out
people<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.200> ARS<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.859> short<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.370> medium<00:04:08.760> at

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
people with ARS it's short to medium at

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.789 
people with ARS it's short to medium at
that<00:04:09.269> short<00:04:09.660> medium<00:04:09.900> range<00:04:10.319> though<00:04:10.530> not<00:04:10.769> the

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
that short medium range though not the

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.259 
that short medium range though not the
short<00:04:11.130> range<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.730> short<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.239> medium

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
short range but the short to medium

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.330 
short range but the short to medium
range<00:04:12.690> zone<00:04:12.959> that's<00:04:13.500> when<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.980> problem

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
range zone that's when it's a problem

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.250 
range zone that's when it's a problem
because<00:04:14.459> shotguns<00:04:15.120> are<00:04:15.419> traditionally

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
because shotguns are traditionally

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.659 
because shotguns are traditionally
supposed<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.769> good<00:04:16.919> at<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.430> that

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
supposed to be good at just that

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.849 
supposed to be good at just that
particular<00:04:18.060> range<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.440> want<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
particular range and if you want it to

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.500 
particular range and if you want it to
be<00:04:19.979> better<00:04:20.190> at<00:04:20.370> longer<00:04:20.579> ranges<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.269> when

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
be better at longer ranges that's when

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.480 
be better at longer ranges that's when
you<00:04:21.630> put<00:04:21.780> on<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> slugs<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.890> problem<00:04:23.370> with

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
you put on the slugs the problem with

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.550 
you put on the slugs the problem with
the<00:04:23.610> shotguns<00:04:24.060> now<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.750> makes<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.229> slugs

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the shotguns now is it makes the slugs

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.470 
the shotguns now is it makes the slugs
irrelevance<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.430> terms<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:27.000> its<00:04:27.150> look

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
irrelevance in terms of its look

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.940 
irrelevance in terms of its look
the<00:04:27.690> argument<00:04:28.170> is<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.620> looks<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:28.830> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the argument is that it looks like a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.070 
the argument is that it looks like a
battlefield<00:04:29.280> for<00:04:29.490> DLC<00:04:29.910> which<00:04:30.510> is<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:31.020> guess

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
battlefield for DLC which is I guess

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.990 
battlefield for DLC which is I guess
understandable<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.310> doesn't<00:04:32.610> look<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.730> much

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
understandable it doesn't look that much

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.910 
understandable it doesn't look that much
different<00:04:33.030> from<00:04:33.390> battlefield<00:04:33.930> 4<00:04:34.200> in<00:04:34.410> fact

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
different from battlefield 4 in fact

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.470 
different from battlefield 4 in fact
when<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.160> saw<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.430> initial<00:04:35.880> trailer<00:04:36.330> I

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
when I saw the initial trailer I

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.300 
when I saw the initial trailer I
legitimately<00:04:36.960> thought<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.710> was<00:04:37.830> battlefield

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
legitimately thought it was battlefield

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.010 
legitimately thought it was battlefield
4<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.760> thought<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> was<00:04:39.270> like<00:04:39.390> an<00:04:39.540> April<00:04:39.810> Fool's

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
4 I thought it was like an April Fool's

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.950 
4 I thought it was like an April Fool's
joke<00:04:40.170> or<00:04:40.500> something<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.980> really<00:04:41.790> did<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.150> was

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
joke or something I really did and I was

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.600 
joke or something I really did and I was
in<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.140> Skype<00:04:43.410> call<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.280> was<00:04:44.430> just

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
in the Skype call and I was just

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.160 
in the Skype call and I was just
laughing<00:04:44.970> my<00:04:45.180> head<00:04:45.450> off<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.720> everyone's<00:04:46.050> like

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
laughing my head off and everyone's like

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.270 
laughing my head off and everyone's like
what<00:04:46.290> are<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.440> talking<00:04:46.740> about<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.160> like

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
what are you talking about and it's like

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.740 
what are you talking about and it's like
I<00:04:47.400> just<00:04:47.430> saw<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.910> battlefield<00:04:48.420> hardline

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I just saw the battlefield hardline

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.390 
I just saw the battlefield hardline
trailer<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.290> looks<00:04:49.590> like<00:04:49.710> battlefield<00:04:50.160> 4

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
trailer this looks like battlefield 4

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.920 
trailer this looks like battlefield 4
but<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.700> don't<00:04:50.940> really<00:04:51.120> care<00:04:51.330> about<00:04:51.390> that<00:04:51.570> as

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
but I don't really care about that as

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.690 
but I don't really care about that as
long<00:04:52.080> as<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.260> gameplay<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.680> good<00:04:52.920> that's<00:04:53.460> not

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
long as the gameplay is good that's not

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.430 
long as the gameplay is good that's not
an<00:04:53.790> issue<00:04:53.880> for<00:04:54.090> me<00:04:54.270> personally<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.080> see<00:04:55.260> why

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
an issue for me personally I can see why

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.500 
an issue for me personally I can see why
other<00:04:55.770> people<00:04:56.280> want<00:04:56.490> innovation<00:04:56.730> in<00:04:57.150> visuals

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
other people want innovation in visuals

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.450 
other people want innovation in visuals
but<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.960> play<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.350> on<00:04:58.440> ultra<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.130> looks<00:04:59.310> good

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
but I play it on ultra so it looks good

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.310 
but I play it on ultra so it looks good
to<00:04:59.610> me<00:04:59.640> I<00:04:59.910> have<00:05:00.090> no<00:05:00.210> problems<00:05:00.630> with<00:05:00.840> the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
to me I have no problems with the

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.350 
to me I have no problems with the
visuals<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:02.010> terms<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.730> maps<00:05:03.000> they're

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
visuals in terms of the maps they're

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.090 
visuals in terms of the maps they're
pretty<00:05:03.630> dang<00:05:03.870> good<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.170> must<00:05:04.530> say<00:05:04.710> they<00:05:04.890> work

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
pretty dang good I must say they work

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.470 
pretty dang good I must say they work
well<00:05:05.370> with<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.730> game<00:05:05.940> modes<00:05:06.180> for<00:05:06.420> example

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
Hotwire which is one of the greatest

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.840 
Hotwire which is one of the greatest

innovations in fps in in recent history
it's<00:05:12.030> basically<00:05:12.480> conquest<00:05:13.110> but<00:05:13.320> it's<00:05:13.500> mobile

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
it's basically conquest but it's mobile

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.010 
it's basically conquest but it's mobile
why<00:05:14.460> would<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.790> play<00:05:14.940> conquest<00:05:15.450> now<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.900> you

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
why would you play conquest now that you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.260 
why would you play conquest now that you
have<00:05:16.230> a<00:05:16.410> mobile<00:05:16.590> conquest<00:05:17.220> more<00:05:17.460> action<00:05:17.850> more

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
have a mobile conquest more action more

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.000 
have a mobile conquest more action more
stuff<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.080> it's<00:05:19.350> just<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.740> better

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
stuff going on it's just a better

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.790 
stuff going on it's just a better
variation<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.910> conquest<00:05:21.690> at<00:05:21.870> this<00:05:21.990> point<00:05:22.320> my

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
variation of conquest at this point my

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.950 
variation of conquest at this point my
favorite<00:05:23.190> map<00:05:23.340> is<00:05:23.550> dust<00:05:23.850> fall<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.510> reminds<00:05:24.900> me

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
favorite map is dust fall it reminds me

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.780 
favorite map is dust fall it reminds me
of<00:05:25.080> like<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.290> mix<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.740> bad<00:05:25.890> company<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.520> map

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
of like a mix of a bad company to map

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.450 
of like a mix of a bad company to map
but<00:05:27.630> there<00:05:27.840> are<00:05:27.960> just<00:05:28.140> lots<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.770> lanes<00:05:29.190> and

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
but there are just lots of lanes and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.130 
but there are just lots of lanes and
it's<00:05:29.670> very<00:05:29.910> predictable<00:05:30.540> movement<00:05:30.990> and

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
it's very predictable movement and

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.390 
it's very predictable movement and
that's<00:05:31.260> what<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.890> don't<00:05:32.070> like<00:05:32.220> where

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
that's what I like I don't like where

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.460 
that's what I like I don't like where
it's<00:05:32.520> all<00:05:32.880> crazy<00:05:33.390> all<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.020> time

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
it's all crazy all the time

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.820 
it's all crazy all the time
I<00:05:34.500> like<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:35.160> there's<00:05:35.910> just<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.720> huge<00:05:37.230> focus<00:05:37.560> on

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
I like that there's just a huge focus on

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.130 
I like that there's just a huge focus on
infantry<00:05:38.370> gameplay<00:05:38.910> on<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.210> conquest<00:05:40.050> map

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
infantry gameplay on a conquest map

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.350 
infantry gameplay on a conquest map
there<00:05:40.770> are<00:05:40.800> those<00:05:41.130> spots<00:05:41.460> for<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.730> snipers<00:05:42.180> to

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
there are those spots for the snipers to

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.360 
there are those spots for the snipers to
camp<00:05:42.600> but<00:05:42.750> there's<00:05:42.900> also<00:05:43.050> areas<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.220> map

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
camp but there's also areas of the map

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.880 
camp but there's also areas of the map
where<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.760> ARS<00:05:45.300> play<00:05:45.630> their<00:05:45.870> role<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.650> PD

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
where the ARS play their role and the PD

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.920 
where the ARS play their role and the PD
w's<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.520> everything<00:05:47.850> else<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:48.240> it's<00:05:48.420> a<00:05:48.540> great

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
w's and everything else so it's a great

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.530 
w's and everything else so it's a great
balance<00:05:49.290> map<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.070> definitely<00:05:51.030> my<00:05:51.210> favorite

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
balance map and definitely my favorite

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.870 
balance map and definitely my favorite
map<00:05:51.720> out<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.230> second<00:05:52.620> beta<00:05:52.770> and<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.520> final

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
map out of the second beta and the final

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.640 
map out of the second beta and the final
argument<00:05:54.390> that<00:05:54.570> I'm<00:05:54.690> going<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:54.960> bring<00:05:55.260> up<00:05:55.440> is

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
argument that I'm going to bring up is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.010 
argument that I'm going to bring up is
the<00:05:55.710> destruction<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:57.240> me<00:05:57.360> it's<00:05:57.540> not<00:05:57.720> too<00:05:57.870> much

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
the destruction to me it's not too much

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.470 
the destruction to me it's not too much
of<00:05:58.200> a<00:05:58.260> big<00:05:58.440> deal<00:05:58.470> because<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.610> just<00:06:00.270> hate<00:06:00.450> being

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
of a big deal because I just hate being

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.530 
of a big deal because I just hate being
killed<00:06:01.050> by<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:02.070> know<00:06:02.190> building<00:06:02.940> collapsing

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
killed by you know building collapsing

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.180 
killed by you know building collapsing
or<00:06:03.660> something<00:06:03.960> I<00:06:04.080> think<00:06:04.110> it's<00:06:04.440> just<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.770> stupid

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
or something I think it's just a stupid

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.160 
or something I think it's just a stupid
way<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.370> die<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:05.880> just<00:06:06.090> another<00:06:06.360> meaningless

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
way to die it's just another meaningless

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.870 
way to die it's just another meaningless
step<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.830> doesn't<00:06:08.130> need<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.370> be<00:06:08.490> in<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.670> game

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
step that doesn't need to be in the game

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.120 
step that doesn't need to be in the game
but<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.450> can<00:06:09.630> see<00:06:09.810> why<00:06:09.990> people<00:06:10.200> want<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.680> the

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
but I can see why people want it the

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.220 
but I can see why people want it the
ability<00:06:11.730> to<00:06:11.760> change<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.540> map<00:06:12.720> on<00:06:12.930> your<00:06:13.110> own

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
ability to change the map on your own

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.650 
ability to change the map on your own
peril<00:06:13.560> can<00:06:14.190> actually<00:06:14.730> affect<00:06:15.060> a<00:06:15.180> game<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.630> I

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
peril can actually affect a game and I

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.540 
peril can actually affect a game and I
can<00:06:15.840> see<00:06:16.020> how<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:16.320> adds<00:06:16.470> another<00:06:16.710> element<00:06:16.980> I

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
can see how it adds another element I

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.150 
can see how it adds another element I
would<00:06:18.330> agree<00:06:18.690> that<00:06:18.810> there<00:06:19.200> should<00:06:19.470> be<00:06:19.500> a<00:06:19.830> lot

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
would agree that there should be a lot

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.100 
would agree that there should be a lot
of<00:06:20.310> destruction<00:06:20.700> at<00:06:21.120> least<00:06:21.420> as<00:06:21.600> much<00:06:21.750> as<00:06:21.810> there

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
of destruction at least as much as there

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.050 
of destruction at least as much as there
was<00:06:22.230> in<00:06:22.380> battlefield<00:06:22.800> 4<00:06:22.890> but<00:06:23.550> I'm<00:06:23.700> not<00:06:23.850> too

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
was in battlefield 4 but I'm not too

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.210 
was in battlefield 4 but I'm not too
fussed<00:06:24.360> either<00:06:24.960> way<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.410> be<00:06:25.590> honest<00:06:26.010> and

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
fussed either way to be honest and

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.790 
fussed either way to be honest and
finally<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.240> problem<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:27.810> had<00:06:28.170> personally

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
finally the problem I had personally

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.860 
finally the problem I had personally
with<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.190> game<00:06:29.370> was<00:06:29.580> I<00:06:29.670> was<00:06:29.880> getting<00:06:30.300> some<00:06:30.600> lag

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
with the game was I was getting some lag

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.500 
with the game was I was getting some lag
and<00:06:31.170> this<00:06:31.800> was<00:06:32.010> even<00:06:32.190> on<00:06:32.430> Australian<00:06:33.060> servers

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
and this was even on Australian servers

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.820 
and this was even on Australian servers
it<00:06:33.660> wasn't<00:06:33.930> just<00:06:34.080> when<00:06:34.230> I<00:06:34.260> was<00:06:34.350> playing<00:06:34.530> on<00:06:34.740> the

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
it wasn't just when I was playing on the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.150 
it wasn't just when I was playing on the
US<00:06:35.130> during<00:06:35.430> my<00:06:35.550> ping<00:06:35.790> hack

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
US during my ping hack

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.800 
US during my ping hack
apparently<00:06:36.550> because<00:06:36.640> apparently<00:06:37.420> every<00:06:37.630> time

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
apparently because apparently every time

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.540 
apparently because apparently every time
I<00:06:37.840> plan<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.110> US<00:06:38.410> server<00:06:38.650> I'm<00:06:38.830> ping<00:06:39.040> hacking<00:06:39.400> but

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
I plan a US server I'm ping hacking but

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.910 
I plan a US server I'm ping hacking but
that's<00:06:40.090> neither<00:06:40.270> here<00:06:40.450> nor<00:06:40.630> there<00:06:40.810> but<00:06:41.170> I<00:06:41.380> was

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
that's neither here nor there but I was

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.680 
that's neither here nor there but I was
just<00:06:41.950> getting<00:06:42.190> a<00:06:42.400> lot<00:06:42.550> of<00:06:42.580> lag<00:06:42.880> and<00:06:43.120> that<00:06:43.540> was

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
just getting a lot of lag and that was

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.150 
just getting a lot of lag and that was
really<00:06:44.020> odd<00:06:44.140> to<00:06:44.170> me<00:06:44.410> maybe<00:06:44.590> it's<00:06:44.800> just<00:06:44.950> because

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
really odd to me maybe it's just because

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.920 
really odd to me maybe it's just because
it's<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:45.580> bait<00:06:45.760> of<00:06:45.910> it<00:06:46.060> but<00:06:46.360> hopefully<00:06:46.750> when

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
it's the bait of it but hopefully when

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.570 
it's the bait of it but hopefully when
the<00:06:47.020> full<00:06:47.170> game<00:06:47.380> comes<00:06:47.650> out<00:06:47.830> there<00:06:48.310> won't<00:06:48.520> be

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
the full game comes out there won't be

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.610 
the full game comes out there won't be
any<00:06:48.910> of<00:06:49.030> that<00:06:49.240> lag<00:06:49.450> but<00:06:49.750> I<00:06:49.780> was<00:06:50.080> getting<00:06:50.410> a<00:06:50.470> lot

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
any of that lag but I was getting a lot

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.710 
any of that lag but I was getting a lot
of<00:06:50.680> rubber<00:06:50.980> banding<00:06:51.490> a<00:06:51.670> lot<00:06:52.090> of<00:06:52.150> situations

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
of rubber banding a lot of situations

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.060 
of rubber banding a lot of situations
where<00:06:52.780> I<00:06:52.900> should<00:06:52.990> have<00:06:53.260> killed<00:06:53.500> that<00:06:53.590> guy<00:06:53.860> but

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
where I should have killed that guy but

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.100 
where I should have killed that guy but
it<00:06:54.220> just<00:06:54.430> didn't<00:06:54.820> happen<00:06:55.000> I'd<00:06:55.750> be<00:06:55.900> interested

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
it just didn't happen I'd be interested

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.330 
it just didn't happen I'd be interested

first beta had no lag whatsoever the
first<00:07:04.570> day<00:07:04.810> of<00:07:04.900> the<00:07:04.990> second<00:07:05.380> beta<00:07:05.530> though<00:07:06.100> lag

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
first day of the second beta though lag

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.180 
first day of the second beta though lag
but<00:07:06.760> from<00:07:06.940> then<00:07:07.120> on<00:07:07.300> it<00:07:07.570> was<00:07:07.870> pretty<00:07:08.560> dang<00:07:08.890> bad

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
but from then on it was pretty dang bad

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.040 
but from then on it was pretty dang bad
it<00:07:09.460> was<00:07:09.550> on<00:07:09.700> and<00:07:09.910> off<00:07:10.000> but<00:07:10.330> it<00:07:10.540> was<00:07:10.630> just<00:07:10.780> so

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
it was on and off but it was just so

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.080 
it was on and off but it was just so
inconsistent<00:07:11.710> that<00:07:12.220> it<00:07:12.490> was<00:07:12.610> quite<00:07:12.880> frankly

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
inconsistent that it was quite frankly

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.750 
inconsistent that it was quite frankly
shocking<00:07:13.810> and<00:07:14.080> it<00:07:14.440> can't<00:07:14.710> be<00:07:14.800> like<00:07:15.070> that<00:07:15.310> when

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
shocking and it can't be like that when

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.750 
shocking and it can't be like that when
the<00:07:15.940> game's<00:07:16.180> fully<00:07:17.170> released<00:07:17.590> but<00:07:17.920> there<00:07:18.640> it
