communicator the person you choose to
focus<00:00:51.739> on<00:00:52.220> is<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.580> have<00:00:52.699> some<00:00:52.909> kind<00:00:53.089> of

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
focus on is to have some kind of

I think ID has always been a champion of
fashion<00:01:16.030> imagery<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.720> feels<00:01:17.140> more<00:01:17.560> positive

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370
