00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.680
 Hi everyone, fine, ok, let's talk today. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.470
 trading is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.410
 fundamental that you know yourself in what 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.690
 you know the other party not only in the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.010
 strategic elements but also in the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.949
 personal elements 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 there is a widely commented theory in 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.420
 negotiation that is called the theory of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 stimuli for this theory we have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 four profiles of negotiators 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.500
 the first of the profiles is the profile 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 catalyst is a normal person. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.809
 very creative person who knows 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 find solutions to the most 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.969
 is a person who lives very focused 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 for ideas ends up having difficulty 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.259
 to operationalize them 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.000
 with this it can lose credibility 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.770
 over time 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.280
 but suppose that you are dealing 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 with a buyer is a catalyst of what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.160
 he wants to know 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 he wants to know about innovation he wants 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.720
 to know if he'll be ahead of him 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 wants to know if that is something 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.869
 in the market if it can stand at the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.420
 in front of others having that product 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.500
 already seller denied and seller 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 catalyst 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.179
 it can create solutions for 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 but it is necessary to assess whether they 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.630
 are possible to implement 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 the second profile is a supportive profile 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.800
 the supporter is a person facing 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.800
 relationship is a person who likes to 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.229
 engaging at the personal level is 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.759
 a person who likes to work 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.500
 information about people 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 relationships and is a person who 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.149
 works very much towards this creation of 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.970
 a trust relationship 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.270
 if you are dealing with a buyer 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.670
 supporter 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.869
 you should value the relationship 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.340
 you should value participation 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.390
 set you must use a language 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.680
 collective language in the first 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.690
 plural person already a supporter seller 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 is a very fit person to deal with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.700
 with situations of relationship that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.599
 require business continuity while 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
 over time 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.550
 the third negotiator profile the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.750
 Analytic analytic a person who wants 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.180
 a lot of security 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.130
 it only makes decisions if you are sure 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.050
 of that 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.930
 will happen then if you are 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.930
 dealing with a buyer to analytical 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.060
 you need to pass all the information 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.460
 process for him to understand 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.760
 exactly what's going to happen 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.920
 in compensation an analytical salesperson is 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.990
 good for a more technical sale with a 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.640
 which requires greater care in the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.890
 presentation of the product in the description 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.100
 what he does for the possible 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.860
 buyer and a quarter of the profiles is the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.090
 controller is a face that 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.570
 Do you want to know the result? 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.250
 His question is basically what 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.830
 I earn from what I earn with this 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.720
 you need to submit data from 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.100
 result to him so that he 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.310
 convince to buy 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.850
 already the controlling vendor is a subject 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.530
 what it is like to be more aggressive in your 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.000
 aggressive approach may not be the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.060
 better time but is a guy who 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 demand is to close business with more 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.940
 speed with more objectivity being good 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.850
 for transaction situations that do not 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.740
 require a very effective continuity in 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.300
 terms of relationship 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.300
 the first thing we have to do is 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.580
 What is our profile? 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.660
 profile of the other party so that people 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.380
 help communication and adjust the 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.380
 negotiation process
