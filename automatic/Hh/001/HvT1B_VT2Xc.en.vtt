00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.110
 yearbook from the school 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.010
 and as connected to the not at once 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.369
 school corridors thing 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.960
 bye Bye 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.220
 I'm sorry for this impromptu but I have you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.410
 seen around a school a couple of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 Sometimes he thought of adding t but that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 race of problems or help help 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.310
 mission failed withdraw city saw in 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 I too could meet you 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.690
 really scary 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480
 everything that came to me by chance 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.120
 stalker and guess what we have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.880
 talked for hours when we arrived at 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.980
 end of the conversation I told her 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.730
 you should also sign my yearbook 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.770
 if we just met you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 go to the field to tomorrow see you there 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 the field is this event style in one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 park organized at school every year yes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.360
 meets molin and finally there 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 presented in person was the dream of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 every stalker jokes anyway is erin 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 it was lower than me froyo but only because 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.789
 he had scoliosis and told me that if not 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 had it been for that it would have been more 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.319
 high or mixed feelings a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.359
 anyway, I got his number 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.479
 and from that moment we talked all about 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.859
 day every day 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.149
 we had a very strong bond I have 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.450
 amazed at how fast we are 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.280
 united 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.350
 we shared many interests there 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 liked to be together 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.710
 I had a crush on myself and before that 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.930
 put I knew you took it too 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.940
 but sometimes you meet the right person 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 at the wrong time 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.580
 I told her I was leaving Canada 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.050
 seriously yes before I lived there and I did 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.900
 request to enter the school of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.200
 toronto architecture took me 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.550
 I'm really happy for you but it's a lot 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.399
 far imagine would I go soon already 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.350
 I'm sorry we weren't together yet 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.140
 when I told him we talked about it 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.090
 while I was going to go I was there 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.600
 for a month we saw each other again 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.850
 day after 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.950
 I know it was a stupid thing to do 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.170
 mine but I asked her to be there anyway 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.320
 my girlfriend though I thought 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.769
 seriously we would have broken 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.590
 at the end of the month the distance is 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.519
 quite preponderant and I would do it a 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.330
 found only once a year but I did it 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.160
 and he said yes about bad 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.180
 timing after leaving 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.250
 at the beginning of July 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 I would be back in Virginia a month later 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.459
 in August because bad timing erin 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.890
 went to volunteer in africa e 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.640
 it would come back exactly after mine 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.110
 re starting for the idea but canada 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.760
 however let's try to be together the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.600
 as possible before the day of 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.480
 judgment but the last day was 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.480
 obviously the hardest 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.260
 we should see each other like via webcam I don't 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.390
 I have a web camera I will buy when I have to 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.820
 still pack up and give it to me 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.200
 rai if you have to leave early tomorrow morning the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.320
 I'll leave it in the mailbox 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.320
 when I come in August it's fine 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 my father wants me at home to believe it 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.640
 having to go 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:43.470
 okay i don't want to say goodbye to you 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.489
 so I tell you see you come to me a 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.849
 to find 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:53.610
 ok i knew i didn't have to watch 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.530
 back but did it and it was 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.920
 painful 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.200
 I told myself not to go back to her 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.379
 it will only make things worse 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.140
 and continues to walk 5 have passed 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.420
 years and I have n't seen her in person since 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.010
 at least it is the palazzo pianciani 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.470
 so they came back to canada and we have 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.419
 tried to keep in touch 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.970
 we talked almost every day and used the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.290
 webcam as much as possible the school start 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.740
 and I was alone in another environment, I tell you 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.169
 one thing 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.389
 architecture is really difficult not 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.940
 I've never spent so many sleepless nights 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.710
 in my life I was stressed and 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.710
 bad mood and that's where they started 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.270
 change things between me and erin we have 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.010
 started talking less because of 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.510
 my thick agenda the quarrels 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.040
 were becoming more frequent e 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.450
 the impact with the school did not help 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.060
 in the way he handled the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.790
 conversations and on the other hand she is not 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.010
 was very sympathetic towards 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.190
 adding all these factors was clear 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.430
 that it was time to close the matter 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.380
 it hurt maybe too bad because not 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.919
 we talked for a while and a few weeks 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.570
 after a friend of ours looked for me and rim 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:12.810
 he lost what he lost his memory well 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.680
 reminds you barely but what the fuck that is 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.889
 success erin had an accident 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.539
 had fallen from the stairs and even if not 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.360
 she was seriously injured 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.610
 you suffer from some amnesia only part 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.729
 of his memories were canceled 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.800
 and I happened to be in those memories 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.389
 no one likes to be forgotten though 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.190
 you have seen enough TV series 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.949
 you will think that I have not done anything that I have 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.570
 said it's much better that way 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.960
 looking introspectively at the light 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.330
 of moon no I did the egoist is said 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.490
 a crap like this is not a series 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.259
 tv ie you think you can forget me 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.570
 so I wrote it wasn't 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.190
 completely forgotten about me knew 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.930
 of my existence but many of ours 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.400
 in the past they were blurred in his 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.500
 memory 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.840
 but as soon as we resumed hearing his 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.669
 memory begins to return and with that 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.370
 also the hostility and the tension that 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.139
 he tried for me we resumed fighting but 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.199
 in the most aggressive passive style 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.180
 conversations were unstable and 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.180
 slowly stopping to talk to us 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.030
 but despite all that it is not that 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.570
 I can say you were a bitch of 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.970
 shit because years later I decided to 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.770
 sign up again we were more 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.440
 mature and managed to get over the old ones 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.730
 wounds 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.340
 you know when it happens to you 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.080
 something and think 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.030
 I bet when we rethink everything 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.480
 this in five years and we'll laugh about 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:50.410
 how stupid we were well that's what it is 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.410
 success between me and erin already
