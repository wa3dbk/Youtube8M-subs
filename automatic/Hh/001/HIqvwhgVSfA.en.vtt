platform<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.930> could<00:03:06.080> think<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.380> now<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
platform I could think of now for the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.220 
platform I could think of now for the
gameplay<00:03:07.970> when<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.540> say<00:03:08.780> Klonoa<00:03:09.110> was<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
gameplay when I say Klonoa was a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.259 
gameplay when I say Klonoa was a
platformer<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.220> but<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> farthest

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
platformer it is but in the farthest

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.449 
platformer it is but in the farthest
sense<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.630> traditional<00:03:12.170> it's<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.830> pioneer<00:03:13.370> in

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
sense of traditional it's a pioneer in

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.610 
sense of traditional it's a pioneer in
the<00:03:13.549> 2.5<00:03:14.239> dejana<00:03:14.750> which<00:03:15.049> basically<00:03:15.350> means

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the 2.5 dejana which basically means

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.400 
the 2.5 dejana which basically means
there<00:03:15.890> are<00:03:15.950> 2d<00:03:16.250> sprites<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> 3d<00:03:17.180> environment

hearing this you may think of a game

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.100 
hearing this you may think of a game
like<00:03:19.580> say<00:03:19.880> donkey<00:03:20.480> kong<00:03:20.720> country<00:03:20.840> returns
