00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.830
 the office has moved out on the twelfth match day, which is very practical 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.009
 Reasons Treaty has still not caught up with his desk 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.150
 interpreted that in the Frankfurt Eintracht as personal 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.330
 Sympathy to pursue or because he among other toughest Bundesliga 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.599
 Football is played this season 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.800
 we are just not about show here at Eintracht so goes to one 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.390
 normal training day the first game of this twelfth game day so 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
 One of the best horses does not shine Dortmund against HSV 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.350
 that is a long time ago that the HSV in Dortmund really makes things easier 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.620
 me the very clear matter he should the course of these Dortmunder 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.060
 even a clear victory 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.900
 for the BVB 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.160
 No 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.040
 We want to signal the company to investors that are values ​​that signal 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.640
 The success of the project is the danger that the coffers 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.940
 the speaker lonely top and the one for artistic dance awaits next 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 I want to match good game twelfth game day namely Werder Bremen against 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.590
 Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.200
 Hard to imagine what would be going on in Bremen Werder lose again 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.739
 is taking for the sixth season defeat hours I think one out of this 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.890
 That's right 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.550
 Draw 2 2 2 unfortunately against Frankfurt will not be on both 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.050
 very well served 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.340
 next match Wolfsburg against Schalke 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.000
 This way you could say funny two clubs where 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.960
 Felix Magath works at the moment it is not at all with him but with it 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.000
 nothing to do with Moosburg's two eldest children's expectations and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 switches 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.600
 that's almost basement derby I guess on four open 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 Shin fracture 2 against Schalke 1 2 1 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 all kinds of 40 percent that we now agree this season 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.610
 pretty high what you get from the others for their club 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.820
 can not say 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 Cologne against Gladbach this is an eternally young experienced 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.670
 I can not imagine how that will win off the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.020
 Gladbacher seen last week and experienced against Bayern Munich I believe 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.350
 that gives an away win for Mönchengladbach two to one just that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.310
 definitely 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.439
 the next game is Kaiserslautern 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.479
 now against the VfB Stuttgart both teams that they are in 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.600
 By the way, it's the first time you've won this season three times 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.770
 Fifteen he fought against inflation as well as a real one 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.060
 Kennerspiel with for me it was explosive I believe that the Stuttgart under 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.739
 her new coach Jens Keller with a victory an away win 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.399
 are empty accordingly 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.319
 3 to 1 spilled 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.989
 that at least for the rest of these sit here it is allow it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.720
 Time is a Büttenrede so it is actually not right in Frankfurt 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.819
 St. Pauli 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.069
 against he has not won since four games I think I am 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.359
 si the Premierentor now just against Leverkusen the table third 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 will be the away win for Leverkusen 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.540
 on the 20 for the heavily maltreated lawn in the commerzbank- Arena and 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:43.009
 Floodlights for our top players Mainz against Hannover Saturday evening 18:30 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.209
 Mainz now wants to win again slowly and I can 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.749
 do not imagine that Hannover 96 successfully resist it 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.309
 now is just right with four goals in Dortmund under the wheels 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.149
 come I believe 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:00.279
 The lights will go out in Mainz 13 05 1 clock against Hannover 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.409
 that they would play Hoffenheim against Freiburg on the day 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.510
 At the beginning of the season are sometimes discharged in the table is so 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.950
 Hoffenheim and Freiburg are 80 points each 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.549
 and yes I have the strange feeling that says Freiburg in Hoffenheim 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.949
 will win +1 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.969
 Leaving Bayern Munich is an uncomfortable game »the second game on 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.860
 Sunday until now is the only statistic free Bundesliga gives b 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.040
 Being so and so it should stay united because what helps if I now too 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.140
 The new bike would have to be decided as well as I have to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.270
 believe this Sunday will not change 3 to 1 though 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.110
 Played hundreds of very successful and good season but overpowered the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.750
 Wine will be so clear I was in Mönchengladbach last Saturday 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.749
 seen 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.339
 because they would have to lead the break already 4 1 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.009
 and then again it is Schweinsteiger the penalty certainly not to the 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.209
 Posts that were all the tips for the twelfth game I have to see now 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.859
 that we are high and I hope that has caught up in the meantime
