think that'd be pretty cool if you guys
did<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.559> change<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
did that because it would change up the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.830 
did that because it would change up the
