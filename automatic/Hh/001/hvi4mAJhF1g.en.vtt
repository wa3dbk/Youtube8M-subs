00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 Hi, I'm coming coming coming coming from four sources give attention 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:29.200
 Well show me another civil Nasu various cosmetics, mainly to tell you the cool 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.289
 That 's why you're used to it. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.989
 So I was brought this brown skin Li 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.989
 I think it's getting better. 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:49.090
 Urucera does not have a reddening or scab like I am after the procedure. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 Anything or swelling, so there is no indication of 3 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.950
 Because of 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.610
 Those who like external activities like Jo Yun- joo 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.700
 When you live your life more than once, 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.070
 I will do that now enough. 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:09.100
 4 Elan Ste filler effect first two years as the key shell is studying four-pillar 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.990
 I'll be my killer that will keep me going. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.600
 From May to six weeks to light about a withdrawal now it is now enough collagen alone. 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.929
 Now that I 'm getting fat, 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.799
 Now, that would be a procedure that creates a natural volume. 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:28.719
 After degeneration, it is completely disassembled, 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:34.509
 Let 's do such a very safe procedure. The merits of Daewoo Sera are why 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:40.569
 But now this is that existing management is just only the surface of the skin if the laser is the same 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.950
 Inside the skin inside the skin, inside the nose, inside the nose, such as gravitational force to raise the laser 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.060
 Because it is a procedure 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.169
 Well, once I shot it, the outline of the face . 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.189
 It was so good. 

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:56.139
 But when I think about the fusing angle being caught, 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.099
 I 'm also worried about it . So I would recommend the filler Elan Shepillar. 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:02.770
 I want to 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:06.929
 Usually filler screen're not good but this is soon going to fit right in accordance with the people 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 It's different, but if you've been in the mosquito for three months , you've lost six, 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:14.350
 The lasting period is about two years calm 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.390
 When I talked to you, inside, this ingredient was collagen 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:25.000
 And calcium is two things that pass, so it does not feel foreign 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.440
 Because of that part, it seems to be the most natural way to make it look tired. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.070
 There are 2 ways you can 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.070
 I want you to warm up the balloon and recommend it to lisa.
