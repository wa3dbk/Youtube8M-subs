00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
cards down in between the rim and the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
cards down in between the rim and the
tire<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> shimmy<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
tire and you kind of got a shimmy it a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
tire and you kind of got a shimmy it a
little<00:01:28.979> bit<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> forth<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.230 
chose to do alternating to green to blue
eight<00:01:36.470> lines<00:01:37.470> facing<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.520> I'm<00:01:38.939> gonna<00:01:39.090> do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
eight lines facing and then I'm gonna do

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.380 
eight lines facing and then I'm gonna do
lines<00:01:39.570> facing<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.090> you're<00:01:42.090> gonna<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
lines facing out so you're gonna do a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.770 
lines facing out so you're gonna do a
double<00:01:42.840> stack<00:01:43.259> yeah<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.310> yeah<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.600> do

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
double stack yeah with yeah if you do

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.050 
double stack yeah with yeah if you do
one<00:01:45.990> card<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.950> stuff<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> card<00:01:47.909> in

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
between the rim and the tire about

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.550 
between the rim and the tire about
midpoint<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> previous<00:01:51.659> card<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.290> seems

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
midpoint of the previous card it seems

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
midpoint of the previous card it seems
