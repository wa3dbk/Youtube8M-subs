 content you have to install that and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:01.320
 after installing that you have to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 connect this on your computer and this one to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.409
 your ps self allow 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.680
 to connect but see if they already have that is 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.369
 the one I showed him in front of that has to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 download it and connect it if you already have 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:25.750
 that installed program connect this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:29.110
 cable here with the pc 7 nps but not 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.869
 you have to turn off your psp system 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.909
 it must totally be off and then 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.929
 connects 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.820
 this cable connected in your psp in your psp 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:46.170
 vita and there 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.440
 there between a while connecting this to the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.310
 computer and this to the psp vita system 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.520
 off an orange will come out 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.479
 orange is loading and that's the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.780
 how you load that is the way 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.680
 it is charged if it does not have this cord 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 that's the way to load 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.780
 good about with the computer 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.490
 and the psp vita system loading that goes 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 to delay about 3 hours maximum and 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.670
 and it was delayed two hours less but 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.850

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.070
