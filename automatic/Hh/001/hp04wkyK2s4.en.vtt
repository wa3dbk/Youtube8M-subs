you'll notice between the two clips are
created<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.120> transition<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.380> double<00:02:14.830> tap<00:02:15.070> on

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
created to transition if I double tap on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.340 
created to transition if I double tap on
that<00:02:15.490> transition<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.630> change<00:02:16.900> some<00:02:17.140> things

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
that transition I can change some things

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.260 
that transition I can change some things
about<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.710> transition<00:02:18.250> including<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.820> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
about the transition including that the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.810 
about the transition including that the
timing<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:20.170> if<00:02:20.560> I'd<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.160> be<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.310> longer

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
timing so if I'd like it to be a longer

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.030 
timing so if I'd like it to be a longer
transition<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.570> can<00:02:23.050> change<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.830> two

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
transition I can change this to be two

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.460 
transition I can change this to be two
seconds<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.700> I'll<00:02:25.600> preview<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.260> I'd

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
seconds and I'll preview that or if I'd

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.200 
seconds and I'll preview that or if I'd
rather<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.190> double<00:02:33.430> tap<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.060> make

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
rather I can double tap on it and make

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.910 
rather I can double tap on it and make
it<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.390> quick<00:02:34.600> transition<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.350> let's<00:02:35.680> preview

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
it a quick transition and let's preview

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.040 
it a quick transition and let's preview
that<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.970> again<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.420> get<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.690> into<00:02:43.930> my

that and again to get this into my
camera<00:02:44.380> roll<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:44.980> back<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.340> my<00:02:45.370> project

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
camera roll I go back to my project

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.120 
camera roll I go back to my project
listing<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:48.150> share<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.690> camera<00:02:49.990> roll

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
