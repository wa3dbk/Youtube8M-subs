00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
you can't imagine enough about that this

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.370 
you can't imagine enough about that this
was<00:04:54.440> me<00:04:54.560> two<00:04:54.770> summers<00:04:55.099> ago<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:57.020> was<00:04:57.200> too

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
was me two summers ago this was too

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.170 
was me two summers ago this was too
bulky<00:04:57.560> my<00:04:58.070> endurance<00:04:58.430> wasn't<00:04:58.820> quite<00:04:59.000> where

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
bulky my endurance wasn't quite where

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.510 
bulky my endurance wasn't quite where
I'd<00:04:59.599> like<00:04:59.870> it<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.140> be<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:01.039> this<00:05:01.220> was<00:05:01.370> me

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
I'd like it to be and so this was me

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.490 
I'd like it to be and so this was me
last<00:05:01.849> summer<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.240> turned<00:05:02.599> off<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.780> muscle<00:05:03.229> just

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
last summer I turned off the muscle just

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.430 
last summer I turned off the muscle just
to<00:05:03.680> increase<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.220> endurance<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.729> it<00:05:04.820> worked

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
to increase the endurance and it worked

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.950 
to increase the endurance and it worked
remarkably<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:07.160> wouldn't<00:05:07.370> believe<00:05:07.490> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
remarkably you wouldn't believe the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.810 
remarkably you wouldn't believe the
athleticism<00:05:08.960> that<00:05:09.380> increased<00:05:09.770> by<00:05:10.400> taking

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820
