00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.840
 This will be a difference to use with embroidery stitch chain 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.839
 I have a different color 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.590
 You can do this with the same color 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.599
 Or different color is up to you 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.570
 Just place your needle needle 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.180
 Then pull it a little left along the back side 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.410
 And now only 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.039
 Weave your needle 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.699
 Through such stitches 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.699
 I am going below both episodes 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 You can see it is creating this little rope effect 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.450
 And thats all there is to it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.760
 Insert the needle to the back side 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.010
 Make a knot 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.950
 Secure your spinning 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.620
 And cutting them off 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.760
 And you have a completely different look 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.409
 With your embroidery stitch series
