five<00:03:07.459> by<00:03:07.580> five<00:03:07.790> anymore<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.500> average

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
five by five anymore I can I can average

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.250 
five by five anymore I can I can average
below<00:03:10.489> three<00:03:10.850> minutes<00:03:11.150> because<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.140> was

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
below three minutes because I was

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.860 
below three minutes because I was
starting<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.739> at<00:03:12.890> one<00:03:13.010> point<00:03:13.330> but<00:03:14.330> then<00:03:14.540> since

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
starting to at one point but then since

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.930 
starting to at one point but then since
I<00:03:14.959> stopped<00:03:15.320> practicing<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.250> started

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
I stopped practicing it I started

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.550 
I stopped practicing it I started
averaging<00:03:17.330> like<00:03:17.420> three<00:03:17.840> minutes<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.380> some

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
averaging like three minutes and some

seconds<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:21.290> uh<00:03:21.320> yeah<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.250> floor<00:03:22.610> and

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
seconds but uh yeah it's floor and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.940 
seconds but uh yeah it's floor and

on this was I think it's cuber Felix mod
I<00:03:40.519> believe<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.870> change<00:03:42.200> these<00:03:42.470> springs<00:03:42.890> to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
I believe and I change these springs to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.410 
I believe and I change these springs to
cube<00:03:43.790> for<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.060> Springs<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:46.519> lubricated<00:03:47.300> it

five minutes my main for seven by seven

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.320 
five minutes my main for seven by seven
would<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.780> center<00:04:00.110> seven<00:04:00.410> by<00:04:00.500> seven<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:01.330> did

tensioned<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.720> these<00:04:10.930> springs<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.560> i'm

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
tensioned it so these springs that i'm

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.600 
tensioned it so these springs that i'm
using<00:04:11.770> this<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.810> had<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.840> v-cube<00:04:14.620> six<00:04:14.980> adjustable

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
using this I had a v-cube six adjustable

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.000 
using this I had a v-cube six adjustable
core<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.780> use<00:04:17.049> these<00:04:17.260> Springs<00:04:17.530> from<00:04:17.739> that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
core and I use these Springs from that

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.379 
core and I use these Springs from that
in<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:20.700> maybe<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.880> can<00:04:22.030> use<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.300> iron

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
in this maybe you can use the iron

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.860 
in this maybe you can use the iron
springs<00:04:22.660> also<00:04:23.080> i<00:04:23.110> am<00:04:23.410> not<00:04:23.590> too<00:04:23.800> sure<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:25.540> this

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
springs also i am not too sure but this

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.159 
springs also i am not too sure but this
is<00:04:26.080> very<00:04:26.350> good<00:04:26.590> very<00:04:27.240> nice<00:04:28.240> puzzle<00:04:28.780> spins
