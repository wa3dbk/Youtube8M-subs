00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.370
 I like to prepare almost all at home 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.260
 the snacks my children make 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.910
 and these cupcakes that are inspired by the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.470
 red velvet recipe are a bit 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.360
 of cupcakes with the trap 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.640
 because in fact and as expected 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.470
 original American recipe inside 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.539
 in red beet is given by I 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 also removed the right dye for 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.519
 make them even healthier and I added a 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.409
 little piece of cocoa that masks the 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:43.899
 taste of beetroot and makes them 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.899
 really special treats 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.149
 to begin with you need a 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.190
 steamed beetroot 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.750
 you can also bake it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.789
 the important thing is that the soft 20 blame 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 to beet I go to add the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.379
 blacksmith cherries that will give the mixture 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.510
 an even more special taste e 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.510
 especially lightly sweet 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.380
 you have to chop it well until the pulp 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.650
 will have reached the consistency of one 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.650
 puree 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.000
 good morning the jug of a blender 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.230
 or even simply a grater 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.720
 beets ready 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.240
 the second passage involves butter and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.590
 sugar mixed together is convenient 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 cut the butter into small pieces 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.130
 quite small so it will be easier 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.130
 knead it with a whisk 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:52.530
 a little vanilla extract just a 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.180
 spoon 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.530
 and now it takes a little patience 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.530
 especially if the cold butter 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.010
 at this point I add the egg 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.180
 it is a little longer to stir the butter with 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.890
 the whisk but don't give in to desire 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.360
 to dissolve it in the microwave because 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.900
 otherwise, remove the texture from the two 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.019
 cupcakes now the woman behind does not 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.209
 sour cherries 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.569
 the combination of beetroot is 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.819
 it really was a revelation to me is 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.590
 inside this cake from really a 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.400
 special taste that few succeed 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.400
 to guess 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.400
 now the flour 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.550
 and the cocoa console 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.960
 and a sieve bicarbonate tip 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.960
 all together and finish mixing 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.500
 almost done the last piece ever goes 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.500
 called by hand 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.150
 the dough is ready I let it rest a 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.480
 moment and in the meantime prepare to 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.140
 mold the oven is already at temperature a 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.140
 180 degrees 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.380
 even if the mold is made of silicone 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.210
 I prefer to butter him for not having 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.990
 surprises when I have to pull out the le 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.990
 my mini red velvet 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.760
 last stage the molds better not 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.540
 fill them too much because they will swell 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.540
 a little during cooking 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.900
 now put them in the oven and in the leaves 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.780
 cook you can serve these mini red 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.430
 velvet also so removed from their own 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.949
 stencil and let it cool 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.800
 or for a much more delicious version 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.160
 with mascarpone cream and one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.160
 marina 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.480
 you have to squeeze the mascarpone cream into 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.670
 so as to leave a small hole 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.000
 inside where to go to fix the 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000
 marina 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.099
 these are excellent for the snack of the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.099
 children but I would say also to do great
