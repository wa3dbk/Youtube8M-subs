you can wear around it you know you can
make<00:03:19.490> this<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.120> literally<00:03:20.480> how<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.900> show<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.660 
make this is literally how to show you
what

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
what

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.500 
what
and<00:03:22.819> they<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:23.120> with<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.790> counts<00:03:26.330> in<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and they do with that it counts in a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.229 
and they do with that it counts in a
perfectly<00:03:27.050> gold<00:03:27.440> paint<00:03:27.800> with<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.400> blue<00:03:28.700> etching

perfectly gold paint with a blue etching

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.780 
perfectly gold paint with a blue etching
of<00:03:29.560> some<00:03:30.560> fancy<00:03:31.069> detail<00:03:31.520> on<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:32.170> but<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:34.430> like

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
of some fancy detail on it but like like

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.420 
of some fancy detail on it but like like
the<00:03:35.360> sword<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.770> bagman<00:03:37.130> retro

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the sword and like the bagman retro

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.229 
the sword and like the bagman retro
retro<00:03:37.640> figure<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.800> paint<00:03:40.250> will<00:03:40.520> chip<00:03:40.760> off<00:03:40.940> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
retro figure the paint will chip off and

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.080 
retro figure the paint will chip off and
you're<00:03:41.390> not<00:03:41.540> careful<00:03:43.660> my<00:03:44.660> solution<00:03:45.050> to<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.800> is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
you're not careful my solution to it is

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.979 
you're not careful my solution to it is
to<00:03:47.090> coat<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.450> with<00:03:47.600> tape<00:03:49.150> literally<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.450> and

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
to coat it with tape literally just and

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.540 
to coat it with tape literally just and
it<00:03:51.140> preserves<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:52.010> paint<00:03:52.819> job<00:03:53.180> because<00:03:53.569> it's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
it preserves the paint job because it's

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.479 
it preserves the paint job because it's
quite<00:03:55.550> literally<00:03:55.880> thin<00:03:56.330> plastic<00:03:57.160> with<00:03:58.160> a

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
quite literally thin plastic with a

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.130 
quite literally thin plastic with a
little<00:03:58.670> sticky<00:03:59.120> stuff<00:03:59.450> on<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.840> other<00:03:59.989> side<00:04:01.000> so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
little sticky stuff on the other side so

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.289 
little sticky stuff on the other side so
problem<00:04:03.140> solved<00:04:03.560> it's<00:04:03.709> like<00:04:03.920> like<00:04:04.519> laminating

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
problem solved it's like like laminating

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.180 
problem solved it's like like laminating
the<00:04:05.480> whole<00:04:05.720> thing

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.030 

when<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:11.940> put<00:04:12.180> together<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.500> sheath<00:04:13.830> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
when it's put together the sheath and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.600 
when it's put together the sheath and
the<00:04:14.340> sword<00:04:14.930> go<00:04:15.930> hand<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.560> hand<00:04:16.620> you're

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
the sword go hand in hand you're

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.600 
the sword go hand in hand you're
probably<00:04:17.850> wondering<00:04:18.000> why<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.680> why<00:04:20.549> is

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
probably wondering why is it like why is

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.310 
probably wondering why is it like why is
there<00:04:20.880> hollow<00:04:21.150> space<00:04:21.510> between<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.049> blade<00:04:22.290> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
there hollow space between the blade and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.730 
there hollow space between the blade and
the<00:04:22.880> Diamonds<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:26.100> saw<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.640> can<00:04:26.820> fit<00:04:27.500> into<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the Diamonds it saw it can fit into the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.800 
the Diamonds it saw it can fit into the
entire<00:04:29.040> thing<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:31.740> then<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.340> look<00:04:32.490> nice
