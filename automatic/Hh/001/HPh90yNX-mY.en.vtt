the<00:03:37.730> one<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.239> five<00:03:38.630> section<00:03:39.320> space<00:03:39.620> saver<00:03:39.860> is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
the one to five section space saver is

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.640 
the one to five section space saver is
about<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.220> third<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:40.940> width<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:42.019> normal

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
about a third of the width of a normal

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.800 
about a third of the width of a normal
tire<00:03:43.250> an<00:03:43.549> or<00:03:43.700> Mille<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> five<00:03:44.209> five<00:03:44.390> Section

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.509 
tire an or Mille to five five Section
tire<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.500> that's<00:03:45.680> about<00:03:45.830> three<00:03:45.980> times<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
tire so that's about three times the

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.220 
tire so that's about three times the
horsepower<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.180> let's<00:03:47.450> say<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> cars<00:03:48.019> got

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
horsepower so let's say the cars got

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.350 
horsepower so let's say the cars got
around<00:03:48.470> 1,200<00:03:49.070> horsepower<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:50.239> have

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
around 1,200 horsepower so what we have

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.039 
around 1,200 horsepower so what we have
behind<00:03:50.510> me<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.440> c63<00:03:52.190> coupe<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.549> with<00:03:53.049> 1200

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
behind me is a c63 coupe a with 1200

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.560 
behind me is a c63 coupe a with 1200
horsepower<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.700> good<00:03:56.000> thing<00:03:58.570> and

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
horsepower and that is a good thing and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.410 
horsepower and that is a good thing and
so<00:03:59.780> here<00:03:59.959> we<00:04:00.080> have<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.220> c63<00:04:01.880> AMG

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
so here we have it this is the c63 AMG

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.560 
so here we have it this is the c63 AMG
