00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.940
 hello to all my shorts killing and this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 The next issue is a solid review of the most 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.410
 unpopular with the most beloved series 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 video on the channel today running analysis 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 will be a gift to meet my eyes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.040
 beautiful bride dm sin city 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.730
 severov on frank miller under one 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.660
 very thick cover that went well 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.579
 big give sin city 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.560
 a compilation that you need to have each 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.060
 self-respecting collector if at home 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.950
 and collections of course after a series 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.950
 frustrations like u can understand i'm talking 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.470
 about skype you're just there I can and also about 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.320
 Deluxe in the edition of a new frontier of which I 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.300
 maybe I'll shoot a video later 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.130
 very afraid in ios and paper quality in 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 However, this collection is not a paper caste. 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.810
 let down again about this a little later 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 I will only say that the main advantage of this 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.180
 collection of sheet that buying only this book 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.189
 already you will have all and dad and all 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 the rules of Frank Miller's epic under one 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.200
 the cover on my shelf however of these 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 pluses from this plus and minuses 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.189
 about which again a little later and so 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.990
 at home the first thing worth telling 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.179
 what is the size of big green sin city 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.679
 Still, the size of this collection is 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.429
 almost the most important distinctive 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.079
 feature 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.990
 now I'll show him the size of big ben 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.329
 sensity on the example of other collections for 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 comparisons we take absolute building 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.020
 very dark knight from frank miller 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 same big dance in city 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.939
 I bet he and not mother over grande amar 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.499
 sina and deluxe hard cover keepers so 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.929
 what we have all let's take 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.630
 the ratio of keepers and him maine for 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.359
 further convenience and so keepers on 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.450
 two centimeters lower than me 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:51.090
 maine and as much already as me bass not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 mind us hi max by four centimeters 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.189
 below and 11 meters 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.929
 already than big darsi incity absolutely alone 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.939
 The same is the same height 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.399
 however, he is one centimeter still 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.289
 wider however, given that this is absolute 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.079
 it is safe to say that 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.810
 big ben sensity in height and width 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.190
 exactly the biggest compilation at 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.650
 least in my collection exactly how much I 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.690
 I know in principle, too, more and more about 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.490
 I still have no bass stars but the first 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800
 teaches us its its important relationship 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.110
 this collection of thickness with the rest 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.030
 so we all run away sin city 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 then the thickest of those published so far 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.650
 what about me bass marvel spiderman from 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.209
 roger erased on and him men grand amour 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.450
 sleep already mentioned delux edition 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.280
 the keepers caught the crisis and the joker 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.620
 lit up and since you can see big 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.360
 ben ten city wins even in thickness 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.350
 all other collections even the most 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.270
 I have thick maru 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.260
 From published there I remember correctly in 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.950
 This, I suppose, and somewhere 1294 pages in 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.840
 while in the collection we run sensity 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.970
 1359 pages here is no dust jacket 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.830
 This is not a trace, and thank God there would be 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.930
 here would be a very dust jacket to us 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.180
 quickly avshar pass the veil of the comic itself 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.140
 in the back we see a brief description of what 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.080
 happening in the comic 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.209
 as well as a cover price of this book to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.940
 notice 100 dollars that is essentially 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.709
 for such a spelling krp 100 dollars this 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.690
 very very few and so let's get started 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.230
 to the insides the first is the process of the eye 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.600
 This bookmark, in principle, it is understandable 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.910
 considering the thickness of the comic book however she and 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.130
 nice because usually there is no such 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.590
 the main thing is really important 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.799
 to catch the eye of the fingers it 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.450
 paper quality paper is not offset here 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.340
 until the last one was afraid that there would be 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.720
 thick as for the luxury edition skald 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.600
 or in new frontier 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.760
 however there is no paper here quite thin 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.720
 and she is here matte and it cannot but 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 may not please 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.880
 Still, it's probably a taste, but to me 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.310
 here is a glossy paper even if we speak 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.410
 about a black and white collection like where 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.400
 more because i don't know about that line 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.769
 just get a story. just so much 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.019
 nicer however here is gloss and i'm very 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.630
 I am glad that my second concerns are 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.730
 immediately collapsed this format I was afraid 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.190
 what will happen if this kind of comic 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.510
 coach on the big page will lose 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.549
 whether it is in the atmosphere 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.170
 or in the drawing of a finger nothing 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.049
 like on big pages 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.579
 use even much more 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.440
 aspirated much better ratio 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.299
 the matter is the same radically nothing 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.450
 there is no gray here either white colors 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.100
 and either black colors and then again what am I 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.290
 afraid he would fade on 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.810
 glossy pages it may fade 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.640
 it has already been precedents however 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.770
 nothing like everything was brought 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.930
 great however you ask me 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.820
 ruslan you praise this collection so much 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.710
 what can be here minus a minus and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.130
 there are regrets then cons water 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.470
 stem from the pros first is weight weight 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.390
 This book is 4 and a half kilograms. 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.530
 maybe a little more so you can 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.270
 imagine what 4 is soldered 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.090
 kilograms and four and a half 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.820
 kilograms is something that is very strong if 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.170
 standing on the shelf presses down on the bottom 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.530
 border spine 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.390
 thus, it is a little bit gradually 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.750
 It bends it appears it dents 1 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.670
 the spine itself is the side root given the weight 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.980
 books and considering what subsequently 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.810
 maybe you will read it this one 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.690
 The collection of the spine will be gradually 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.560
 unstuck here as you can see here 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.870
 there is a special air gap 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.190
 so that the case of what page could 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.960
 normally turned over however 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.710
 believe it will not last long that is 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.410
 comic strip 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.660
 it is strictly not recommended to read a lot and in 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.520
 Basically I'm not going to read the city 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.950
 sins i read about recount in 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.140
 such a dregs I do not want no going no 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.450
 and thanks on the shelf, let it stand and be 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.790
 stand great but it's not even 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.430
 the whole point is that the book is fragile and yes 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.170
 this is no joke despite its weight 400 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.870
 kilo and santa what is she thick 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.520
 1000 almost one thousand four hundred pages and then 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.710
 that she is more than other books she 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.150
 fragile she is very fragile as a single 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.670
 then hanging what's under her weight she 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.430
 bent so I took it now but in the hands of 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.140
 show you so roll left 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.940
 right and pressure on the spine 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.460
 increases by the spine or by 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.330
 the cover thus the book gradually 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.490
 little by little she 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.870
 it is not very good 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.220
 there is if you buy this book it 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.530
 implies that you read everything 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.820
 novels and you just want to have data 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.550
 romance on his shelf 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.290
 that is, it is better not to touch her better day 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.060
 read and careful not be treated because 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.310
 that she is very very fragile I repeat 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.220
 by itself, you want to attack this dog 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.750
 the book is very very modest nadoba under 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.520
 humble have something that their here in 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.210
 Basically no, that is, we have one 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.850
 page 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:32.050
 Here is such a list of all 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:36.580
 novels including art book 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:40.030
 photo with inserts lera and small here 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.509
 times two three 4 5 6 6 paragraphs by author and 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.129
 all friends and everything well, you know what I mean 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.259
 imagine it would be here and ext this book 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.960
 in principle it would be too heavy and would itself 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.389
 spoiling yourself under your own weight and what not 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.949
 very good however I repeat despite 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.080
 on all the pros and cons of this collection 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.780
 buy it or not it's up to you 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.389
 if you read simcity if you want 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.190
 have it in the collection run by bathing 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.300
 taxed on allows however if you 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.009
 don't like the city ​​of sins 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.990
 you have the money you want to buy it 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.120
 what to put near the toilet and and read 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.620
 from time to time this does not fit this 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.870
 the book is only needed so that 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.400
