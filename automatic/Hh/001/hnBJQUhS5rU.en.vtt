 With light and texts witcher of all this is very 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.280

 remember how it all began in the most 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.230
 the first game we poked from one 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.670

 free space 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.120
 matchless look very soft 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.890
 drawn in particular by measure 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.630

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.070
 behind 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.070
 [music] 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.290
 the main character is important fair with 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.800

 if there are more and Gerard apartment 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.360
 the center of the city would be tom sure 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.310
 an enviable bridegroom 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.319
 and so he has to knock between 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.299
 frankly 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.799

 witch along with the ability to swim and 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.250
 ride horses and so cheese episodes with 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.319
 blonde beast really refreshing 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.420
 already unnecessary gameplay particular 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.430

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:54.079
 games and movies cult 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.480
