 m in ukraine 4 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.810
 by manchester united are the star team 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.079
 in this and the movies as you mail 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.819
 a number of employees lived there 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.769
 of the Dutch that was mainly due to 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.739
 I also give well in its structure 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.980
 9 there were even what I think after 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.310
 and with that retarded accident 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 7 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.559
 But from that is a nice and modest income 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 the will do 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.890
 I did get a nice score 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 but a bit pathetic does not think so well 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.890
 the driver who nolan euro in may decor youth camp youth work people 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.570
 is better ruud 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.740
 The seawall had promised them the neighborhood team without being on the pay 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.680
 I don't apologize for that 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.960
 but here is so and i also restore this version 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510
 no less than fifteen alarms 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.050
 so that wanted parquet 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.110
 so I think I would have liked the speech 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.100
 look 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.760
 my voice and gregory van der wiel 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.230
 Sint Truiden and so on 9 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.130
 but I realize well 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.600
 I am I have a new species because the quickscopes only to a limited extent 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 and to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.300
 if you rose in such matches, practice well because you just play all of them 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.660
 the Scheldt quickly with such a weapon 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 quickscopes and that stone year and then you can just leave without getting better 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.890
 to become 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.430
 so that steve brown paper 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 I won't be able to look so well in the coming weeks 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.010
 am also busy with other things 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.440
 so yes 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.650
 the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.560
 three years 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.900
 motörhead the viewer nikolai come and then 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.590
 and I have added you other favorites but if you want to add me the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.989
 queen would do it if it was easy 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 that can be a parade of the direction antwerp 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.769
 we have 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.810
 name 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.979
 the playstation 3 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.499
 there I look play on the left this 3 must 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.719
 because they also get a number of roads but yes you play open like that 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.939
 things and you can see what you see on the right in the image 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009
 the share opened 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.199
 they stand 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.699
 and at the x box that the escape to work is limited 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 he wants the quality of the movie she's in, so it's not fantastic me 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.939
 do not know exactly what happened 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.849
 he clarified the man but that made fnv 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.539
 yes it was no different 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.939
 just 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.309
 wrong setting stronger in December 6 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.409
 so what we have to do with this is the film 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.019
 the one sure by far makes the most of the kenzo public 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:14.870
 perfect 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.089
 9 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.289
 and it did 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.830
 and precisely all were a record fine 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.049
 and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.039
 because great 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.409
 to play the grass 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.830
 i got going 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.830
 create make it work huh 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.139
 Diana 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.139
 I have years and and 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:43.369
 there will certainly be sometime but when people and china take a different approach 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.949
 staff of the iphone on but it makes more sense to the king 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.900
 since it's just another 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.829
 we make a nice movie out of it 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.459
 the pda cornerman 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.179
 and then 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.179
 I am here viewing sir can 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.919
 I hope 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.559
 a Thursday or Friday with the game has one used for it in the morning 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.559
 because I am a TMF award very twice 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.130
 8 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.130
 so yes then you just have to look at it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.229
 we see it as unfair to do so we can look with the first room 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.569
 can place one at the end of the ride recently though its another 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 the people who want to participate can open bills 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:40.499
 Viewers can watch a popular game of Lexmond for fun 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.270
 and then 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.270
 Keeping years seems like such an operation theme 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.710
 I think he would see him sometimes 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 the exhibition is also a petition to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.300
 So 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.249
 yes nice there too the Coptic pelé 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:01.849

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.379
 well then the 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.379
 what much to notice for colleagues 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.210
 a computer 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.750
 because it stays beautiful 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.620
 so nice floor 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.360
 and intended and 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.699

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.949

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.360
