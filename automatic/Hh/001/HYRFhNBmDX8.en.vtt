so welcome to the next presentation of

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.780 
so welcome to the next presentation of
additional<00:00:10.290> functionality<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.370> office

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
additional functionality of the office

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940 
additional functionality of the office
synchronizer<00:00:12.269> from<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.690> front<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.290> new

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
synchronizer from in front of this new

synchronizer from in front of this new
demo<00:00:14.370> shows<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.540> drag-and-drop

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
demo shows you the drag-and-drop

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.720 
demo shows you the drag-and-drop
mechanism<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.800> can<00:00:16.949> easily<00:00:17.100> start<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
mechanism you can easily start the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
mechanism you can easily start the
drag-and-drop<00:00:17.940> mechanism<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.380> that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
drag-and-drop mechanism and you see that

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.370 
drag-and-drop mechanism and you see that
in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.310> area<00:00:20.939> below<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.570> include<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.170> mini

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
in the area below we include a mini

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.410 
in the area below we include a mini
Explorer<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.550> makes<00:00:23.730> sense<00:00:24.000> for

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
Explorer and this makes sense for

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
Explorer and this makes sense for
example<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.050> working<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.830> site

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
example if you are working in a site

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.300 
example if you are working in a site
Rick's<00:00:26.580> environment<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
Rick's environment so we have not the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
Rick's environment so we have not the
transfer<00:00:29.820> between<00:00:30.090> two<00:00:30.720> terminal<00:00:31.230> sessions

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
transfer between two terminal sessions

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
transfer between two terminal sessions
for<00:00:31.740> example<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.669> makes<00:00:32.880> sense<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.450> we

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
for example so this makes sense that we

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
for example so this makes sense that we
included<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.320> mini<00:00:34.770> Explorer<00:00:35.309> directly<00:00:36.030> in

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
included this mini Explorer directly in

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.990 
included this mini Explorer directly in
the<00:00:36.270> biz<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.719> drag<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> drop<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.399> right

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the biz to drag and drop so on the right

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.540 
the biz to drag and drop so on the right
area<00:00:39.420> below<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.140> identify<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> files<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
area below you identify the files and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.819 
area below you identify the files and
now<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.390> able<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.930> click<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> files

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
now you are able to click on the files

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910 
now you are able to click on the files
one<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:45.030> files<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.289> easily

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
one and more files and you can easily

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.060 
one and more files and you can easily
move<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.840> upper<00:00:49.200> area<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> upper

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
move them in the upper area the upper

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
move them in the upper area the upper
area<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> preparation<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
area this is the preparation for the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
area this is the preparation for the
transfer<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> direction<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.480> SF<00:00:54.840> Peter

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
transfer into the direction of SF Peter

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
transfer into the direction of SF Peter
for<00:00:55.320> example<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.070> choose<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.879> fouls<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
for example we choose the two fouls and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.590 
for example we choose the two fouls and
of<00:00:58.079> course<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.100> choose<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.879> files<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of course if you choose these files you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
of course if you choose these files you
can<00:01:00.780> select<00:01:01.050> afterwards<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
can select afterwards one or more of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.210 
can select afterwards one or more of
these<00:01:02.760> files<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.359> change<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.769> example

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
these files and change them for example

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.219 
these files and change them for example
for<00:01:05.400> copy<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:06.090> move<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.990> change

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for copy or move there will you change

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.260 
for copy or move there will you change
the<00:01:07.470> character<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> transfer<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> then

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the character of the transfer and then

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.320 
the character of the transfer and then
in<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.979> example<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.850> word

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
in just we see for example in the word

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.050 
in just we see for example in the word
integration<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.380> uses<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> same<00:01:14.610> term

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
integration we uses all the same term

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
integration we uses all the same term
this<00:01:15.299> uses<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.439> configuration<00:01:16.950> inside

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this uses the same configuration inside

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
this uses the same configuration inside
SP<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.689> means<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
SP and this means that we have now the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.990 
SP and this means that we have now the
possibility<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.680> switch<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> SLP<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
possibility to switch over to SLP and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960 
possibility to switch over to SLP and
ask<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.630> sappy<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.439> kind<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> document<00:01:26.729> types

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
ask a sappy what kind of document types

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
ask a sappy what kind of document types
but<00:01:27.299> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> document<00:01:28.259> classes<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but kind of document classes are in the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
but kind of document classes are in the
customizing<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> sfe<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:31.860> easy

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
customizing of sfe and so with an easy

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.380 
customizing of sfe and so with an easy
selection<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.509> able<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.930> generate<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
selection we are able to generate a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
selection we are able to generate a
document<00:01:36.390> info<00:01:36.659> record<00:01:37.020> inside<00:01:37.439> SP<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
document info record inside SP and of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
document info record inside SP and of
course<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.570> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> move<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.530> file<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:41.280> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
course if we want to move a file then we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
course if we want to move a file then we
are<00:01:41.700> asked<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> after<00:01:42.840> successfully

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
are asked for after successfully

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.789 
are asked for after successfully
executed<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> system<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:46.049> file<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
executed that on the system one file is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.060 
executed that on the system one file is
deleted<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.810> do<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.930> want<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> continue<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
deleted and do you want to continue this

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.210 
deleted and do you want to continue this
makes<00:01:50.460> sense<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.450> makes<00:01:51.840> probably<00:01:52.770> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
makes sense if you makes probably some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.039 
makes sense if you makes probably some
failure<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.630> course<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.200> respect<00:01:56.189> the

failure and of course to respect the

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.690 
failure and of course to respect the
customizing<00:01:58.049> inside<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> pea<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.549> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
customizing inside as a pea and you have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.749 
customizing inside as a pea and you have
chosen<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.390> different<00:02:01.110> document<00:02:01.950> class<00:02:02.189> then

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
chosen the different document class then

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.719 
chosen the different document class then
SP<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.750> ask<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.380> some<00:02:04.920> relevant<00:02:05.430> data

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
SP will ask you for some relevant data

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.809 
SP will ask you for some relevant data
relevant<00:02:06.719> criteria<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.890> course<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
relevant criteria of course you have the

we have a look on the document info

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.360 
we have a look on the document info
record<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.520> we<00:03:30.790> see<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.690> new<00:03:32.320> file<00:03:32.740> has
