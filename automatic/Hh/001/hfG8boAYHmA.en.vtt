base tech distance has been buffed this

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.450 
base tech distance has been buffed this
means<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.870> range<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.580> move<00:00:14.790> distance<00:00:16.460> it

means the range and the move distance it

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.179 
means the range and the move distance it
also<00:00:17.609> has<00:00:18.060> buffs<00:00:18.359> knock<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.900> now<00:00:21.020> his<00:00:22.189> basic

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
airoldi has much larger knock back so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.990 
airoldi has much larger knock back so
there's<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:36.380> his<00:00:37.380> dash<00:00:38.040> hold<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:38.850> not

there's that his dash hold do was not

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
there's that his dash hold do was not
only<00:00:39.149> made<00:00:39.390> faster<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.480> more<00:00:42.750> damage<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
only made faster it does more damage and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.250 
only made faster it does more damage and
now<00:00:43.950> has<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.670> lift<00:00:45.149> applied<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.750> people<00:00:45.899> caught

now has a lift applied to people caught

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.850 
now has a lift applied to people caught
in<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> easier<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.239> hitting<00:00:48.600> them

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.729 

holte<00:00:52.860> damage<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> firing<00:00:54.120> rate<00:00:54.710> has<00:00:55.710> been

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
holte damage and firing rate has been

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.510 
holte damage and firing rate has been
adjusted<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> launcher<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:59.100> made

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
adjusted the launcher was also made

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.310 
adjusted the launcher was also made
faster<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> does<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:01.530> damage<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
faster and does more damage and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.130 
faster and does more damage and
everything<00:01:04.320> we're<00:01:05.280> finessing<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> Hodes

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
everything we're finessing is Hodes

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.910 
everything we're finessing is Hodes
range<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:08.159> buffed<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> goes<00:01:10.290> further<00:01:10.500> now

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.190 

the<00:01:13.920> recovery<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.000> gauge<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.810> faster

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the recovery of the gauge is also faster

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
the recovery of the gauge is also faster
so<00:01:16.860> there's<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.520> well<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:19.220> before<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so there's that as well and before I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.149 
so there's that as well and before I
move<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.900> something<00:01:22.350> very<00:01:22.530> important

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
move on there's something very important

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
move on there's something very important
I<00:01:23.189> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.750> with<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.220> holding<00:01:26.689> so

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I need to show with this holding so

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
I need to show with this holding so
let's<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> started<00:01:31.460> before<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.790> whole<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
let's get started before the whole to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.319 
let's get started before the whole to
you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.840> hit<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.229> targets<00:01:34.650> max<00:01:35.329> let's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you can only hit three targets max let's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.130 
you can only hit three targets max let's
sway<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.350> works<00:01:38.009> test<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
sway for all my works test on here and I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.450 
sway for all my works test on here and I
don't<00:01:40.200> wait<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.189> take<00:01:41.340> well

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.380 

yeah<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.220> trinket<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.329> since

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.830 

it's<00:01:55.390> much<00:01:55.660> faster<00:01:55.930> than<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.440> used<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.800> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it's much faster than it used to be so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.940 
it's much faster than it used to be so
that's<00:01:58.840> changing<00:01:59.260> me<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.470> trinket<00:02:04.950> just

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
that's changing me on the trinket just

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.800 
that's changing me on the trinket just
to<00:02:06.040> cover<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.490> again<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:10.330> all<00:02:10.480> I<00:02:10.510> think

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
to cover that again that's all I think

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.260 
to cover that again that's all I think
it<00:02:10.930> does<00:02:11.050> now<00:02:11.290> its<00:02:11.680> range<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.910> attack<00:02:13.240> speed

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
it does now its range and attack speed

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:23.460 
it does now its range and attack speed
was<00:02:14.050> buffed<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:20.200> weapon<00:02:20.980> skill<00:02:22.200> now<00:02:23.200> has<00:02:23.440> a

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
a knock-back was buffed on launcher as

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.100 
a knock-back was buffed on launcher as
was<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> range<00:04:10.020> basically<00:04:11.480> ok<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:12.540> that

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
was the range basically ok so that

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:21.500 
was the range basically ok so that
bazooka<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:15.650> explosive<00:04:16.650> range<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.820> was<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
bazooka the explosive range of it was it

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.820 
bazooka the explosive range of it was it
also<00:04:21.930> only<00:04:22.200> takes<00:04:22.530> 20<00:04:24.650> passive<00:04:25.650> as<00:04:25.740> well<00:04:25.950> now

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
also only takes 20 passive as well now

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.510 
also only takes 20 passive as well now
and<00:04:28.880> supposedly<00:04:29.880> they<00:04:30.720> either<00:04:31.440> sped<00:04:32.280> up

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
and supposedly they either sped up

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.890 
and supposedly they either sped up
switching<00:04:33.000> into<00:04:34.850> different<00:04:35.850> modes<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.600> hold

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
switching into different modes and hold

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.110 
switching into different modes and hold
er<00:04:37.440> hold<00:04:38.360> itself<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:39.570> faster<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.940> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
er hold itself as faster so that's it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.409 
er hold itself as faster so that's it
