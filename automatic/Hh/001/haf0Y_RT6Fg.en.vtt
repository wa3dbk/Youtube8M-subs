doesn't do any more I believe because

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
doesn't do any more I believe because
it's<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.619> labor-intensive<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> see

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's so labor-intensive bit you can see

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
it's so labor-intensive bit you can see
the<00:01:12.450> pull<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:12.659> over<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.729> pull

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the pull down over here and the pull

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
the pull down over here and the pull
down<00:01:14.939> over<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> 60-40
