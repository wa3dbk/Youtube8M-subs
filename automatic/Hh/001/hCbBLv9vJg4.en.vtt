mountain by racer and that's how come

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.770 
mountain by racer and that's how come
yeah<00:04:39.280> it's<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.819> damn<00:04:39.969> sight<00:04:40.150> steeper<00:04:40.509> than<00:04:40.599> rail

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
yeah it's a damn sight steeper than rail
