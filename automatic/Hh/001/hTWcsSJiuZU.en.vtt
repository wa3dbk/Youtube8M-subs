apparently<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.110> Russia<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:14.220> outlawed

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
apparently in Russia they outlawed

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.930 
apparently in Russia they outlawed
combat<00:01:17.040> knives<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> while<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> there

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
combat knives for a while and so there

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.109 
combat knives for a while and so there
started<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.960> development<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.850> style

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
started to be a development of a style

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
started to be a development of a style
that<00:01:24.330> used<00:01:24.540> kitchen<00:01:25.080> knives<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.770> throw<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that used kitchen knives to throw and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
that used kitchen knives to throw and
this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> kitchen<00:01:27.720> knives<00:01:28.050> looked

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
this is what the kitchen knives looked

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.900 
this is what the kitchen knives looked
like<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.800> eventually<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.310> evolved<00:01:29.700> over

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
like so eventually they evolved over

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.160 
like so eventually they evolved over
time<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.300> like<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:32.390> I'd<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.810> start

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
time to look like this I'd like to start

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.930 
time to look like this I'd like to start
out<00:01:34.290> talking<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.800> sheath<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.910> a

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
out talking about the sheath it is a

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.020 
out talking about the sheath it is a
belt<00:01:36.660> sheath<00:01:36.960> at<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> nice<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:38.369> opening<00:01:38.820> I

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
throw using the Russian no spin style
also<00:02:35.940> called<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> wave<00:02:36.690> style<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.440> got<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
also called the wave style it's got a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.220 
also called the wave style it's got a
lot<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:37.890> names<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.780> gonna<00:02:39.900> call<00:02:40.140> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
lot of names but I'm just gonna call it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.720 
lot of names but I'm just gonna call it
the<00:02:40.350> Russian<00:02:40.680> no<00:02:41.160> spin<00:02:41.430> style<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the Russian no spin style for now but I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.580 
the Russian no spin style for now but I
found<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.850> was<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:45.000> easy<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> use<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
found it was very easy to use this and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.190 
found it was very easy to use this and
also<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.459> found<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.239> could<00:02:48.270> do<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> drawing

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
also I found that I could do a drawing

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.050 
also I found that I could do a drawing
throw<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.400> sheath<00:02:50.610> from<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
throw out of it from the sheath from the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.339 
throw out of it from the sheath from the
hip

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
hip

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.130 
hip
the<00:02:52.560> smaller<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.219> however<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.840> bit

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the smaller one however it was a bit

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.410 
the smaller one however it was a bit
harder<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.859> throw<00:02:56.159> because<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:56.879> just<00:02:57.209> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
harder to throw because it's just so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.339 
harder to throw because it's just so
light<00:02:57.689> I'd<00:02:58.019> say<00:02:58.560> after<00:02:58.829> maybe<00:02:59.689> 10<00:03:00.689> feet<00:03:01.079> this

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
light I'd say after maybe 10 feet this

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.470 
light I'd say after maybe 10 feet this
got<00:03:01.620> impossible<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.549> aim<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:02.939> throw<00:03:03.209> because

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
got impossible to aim or throw because

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.000 
got impossible to aim or throw because
it<00:03:03.659> would<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.959> fall<00:03:04.139> out<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.349> your<00:03:04.560> hand<00:03:04.739> if

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
it would just fall out of your hand if

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.179 
it would just fall out of your hand if
you<00:03:05.129> were<00:03:05.249> using<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.639> no-spin<00:03:05.849> throw<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:10.189> tips

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
you were using a no-spin throw the tips

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.129 
you were using a no-spin throw the tips
of<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.519> knives<00:03:11.730> are<00:03:12.150> nice<00:03:12.540> you've<00:03:12.810> got<00:03:13.019> this

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
of the knives are nice you've got this

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.140 
of the knives are nice you've got this
nice<00:03:13.379> little<00:03:13.620> swedge<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.639> back<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
nice little swedge on the back of the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.250 
nice little swedge on the back of the
knives<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.719> bring<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.469> tip<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:18.260> poignant

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
knives to bring that tip to a poignant

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.259 
knives to bring that tip to a poignant
point<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:21.599> I<00:03:22.260> did<00:03:23.159> experience<00:03:23.459> some<00:03:23.730> bending

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
point it I did experience some bending

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.300 
point it I did experience some bending
on<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.599> tip<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.139> smaller<00:03:25.469> one<00:03:25.709> which<00:03:26.069> was

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
on the tip of the smaller one which was

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.629 
on the tip of the smaller one which was
a<00:03:26.340> shame<00:03:26.700> because<00:03:26.939> I<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:28.280> wanted<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> see

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
a shame because I really wanted to see

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.750 
a shame because I really wanted to see
what<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.389> smaller<00:03:30.689> one<00:03:30.900> could<00:03:31.109> do<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.760> it's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
what the smaller one could do and it's

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.670 
what the smaller one could do and it's
not<00:03:32.939> really<00:03:33.299> useful<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.139> a<00:03:34.199> lot<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.500> things

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
not really useful for a lot of things

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
not really useful for a lot of things
the<00:03:35.400> bigger<00:03:35.609> one<00:03:35.819> however<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.449> wasn't<00:03:36.659> a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the bigger one however there wasn't a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.229 
the bigger one however there wasn't a
lot<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.079> bending<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:38.069> knife<00:03:38.549> hit<00:03:38.909> other

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
lot of bending the knife hit other

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.080 
lot of bending the knife hit other
knives<00:03:39.659> on<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.260> blade<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.129> there<00:03:41.400> was<00:03:41.669> no

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
knives on the blade and there was no

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.500 
knives on the blade and there was no
chipping<00:03:42.419> just<00:03:42.900> some<00:03:43.049> bending<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:45.060> feels<00:03:45.359> very

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
chipping just some bending it feels very

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.349 
chipping just some bending it feels very
nice<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.230> hand<00:03:46.370> that's<00:03:47.370> very<00:03:47.730> ergonomic

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
nice in the hand that's very ergonomic

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.659 
nice in the hand that's very ergonomic
because<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.139> this<00:03:49.290> rounded<00:03:49.739> handle<00:03:50.129> back<00:03:50.310> you

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
because of this rounded handle back you

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.149 
because of this rounded handle back you
can<00:03:50.909> fit<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.299> in<00:03:51.540> your<00:03:52.109> finger<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:52.859> easily

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
can fit it in your finger very easily

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.080 
can fit it in your finger very easily
for<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:53.969> no<00:03:54.419> spin<00:03:54.480> throw<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.579> also<00:03:56.579> just<00:03:56.939> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
for the no spin throw and also just to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.420 
for the no spin throw and also just to
check<00:03:57.389> I<00:03:57.659> did<00:03:57.989> make<00:03:58.290> sure<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.859> you<00:03:59.099> could

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
check I did make sure that you could

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.420 
check I did make sure that you could
spin<00:04:00.090> throw<00:04:00.419> these<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.829> it's<00:04:02.069> it's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
spin throw these and you can it's it's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.890 
spin throw these and you can it's it's
not<00:04:02.579> hard<00:04:02.879> they've<00:04:03.120> still<00:04:03.359> got<00:04:03.509> a<00:04:03.540> balance

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
not hard they've still got a balance

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.140 
not hard they've still got a balance
point<00:04:04.169> like<00:04:04.349> any<00:04:04.500> other<00:04:04.709> knife<00:04:05.150> ironically

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
point like any other knife ironically

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.020 
point like any other knife ironically
they're<00:04:06.449> actually<00:04:06.959> quite<00:04:07.139> centered<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.849> if

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
they're actually quite centered so if

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.550 
they're actually quite centered so if
you<00:04:09.180> wanted<00:04:09.509> to<00:04:09.629> spend<00:04:09.840> throw<00:04:10.109> these<00:04:10.290> there'd

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
you wanted to spend throw these there'd

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.300 
you wanted to spend throw these there'd
be<00:04:10.709> no<00:04:10.889> problem<00:04:11.069> with<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:12.979> actually<00:04:13.979> found

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
be no problem with that I actually found

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.640 
be no problem with that I actually found
spin<00:04:14.699> throwing<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.509> smaller<00:04:15.959> one<00:04:16.199> easier

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
spin throwing the smaller one easier

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.999 
spin throwing the smaller one easier
than<00:04:16.979> trying<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.340> no<00:04:17.519> spin<00:04:17.820> throw<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:19.009> it

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
than trying to no spin throw it and it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.399 
than trying to no spin throw it and it
was<00:04:20.159> also<00:04:20.340> easier<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> no<00:04:21.329> spin<00:04:21.659> throw<00:04:21.959> than

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
was also easier to no spin throw than

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.550 
was also easier to no spin throw than
the<00:04:23.070> cold<00:04:23.580> steel<00:04:23.940> knife<00:04:24.750> again<00:04:25.199> because<00:04:25.530> of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the cold steel knife again because of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.290 
the cold steel knife again because of
these<00:04:25.800> bumps<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.729> back<00:04:26.849> of<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.120> knife

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
these bumps on the back of the knife

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.990 
these bumps on the back of the knife
just<00:04:28.220> made<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.370> difficult<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:32.490> blade<00:04:32.699> steel<00:04:32.940> I

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
just made it difficult the blade steel I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.649 
just made it difficult the blade steel I
think<00:04:33.449> is<00:04:33.659> 440<00:04:34.289> C<00:04:34.470> on<00:04:34.650> these<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.520> they're<00:04:36.509> just

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
think is 440 C on these so they're just

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.999 
think is 440 C on these so they're just
like<00:04:36.870> any<00:04:37.020> other<00:04:37.199> knife<00:04:37.469> but<00:04:37.680> they<00:04:37.800> take<00:04:37.979> a

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
like any other knife but they take a

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.670 
like any other knife but they take a
beating<00:04:38.430> well<00:04:38.669> with<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.150> exception<00:04:39.570> of

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
beating well with the exception of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.860 
beating well with the exception of
smaller<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:40.949> as<00:04:41.099> thick<00:04:41.280> one

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
smaller not as thick one

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.209 
smaller not as thick one
speaking<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.960> thickness<00:04:43.409> the<00:04:43.590> stock<00:04:43.860> on<00:04:44.070> this

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
speaking of thickness the stock on this

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.459 
speaking of thickness the stock on this
is<00:04:44.430> quite<00:04:45.120> thick<00:04:45.479> I'd<00:04:46.289> say<00:04:48.259> comparable<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.409> the

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469 
is quite thick I'd say comparable to the

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.899 
is quite thick I'd say comparable to the
cold<00:04:49.740> steel<00:04:50.479> maybe<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.599> bit<00:04:51.780> smaller<00:04:52.699> it<00:04:53.699> has<00:04:53.880> a

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
cold steel maybe a bit smaller it has a

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.459 
cold steel maybe a bit smaller it has a
lanyard<00:04:54.240> wall<00:04:54.599> so<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:54.870> could<00:04:55.050> attach<00:04:55.320> a

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
lanyard wall so you could attach a

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.899 
lanyard wall so you could attach a
lanyard<00:04:55.650> if<00:04:56.009> you<00:04:56.099> want<00:04:56.310> but<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.520> found<00:04:56.729> it

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
lanyard if you want but I found it

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.939 
lanyard if you want but I found it
easier<00:04:57.210> just<00:04:57.270> using<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.530> grabbing

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
easier just using that as a grabbing

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.180 
easier just using that as a grabbing
point<00:04:59.190> itself<00:04:59.960> being<00:05:00.960> able<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.320> pull<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.039> it

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
point itself being able to pull on to it

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.640 
point itself being able to pull on to it
by<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:02.550> little<00:05:03.479> hole

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.400 

if<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:08.520> were<00:05:08.700> thinking<00:05:09.630> about<00:05:09.750> buying<00:05:09.870> a

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
if you were thinking about buying a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.260 
if you were thinking about buying a
knife<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.920> no<00:05:11.250> spin<00:05:11.580> throwing<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.120> would

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
knife for no spin throwing I would

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.080 
knife for no spin throwing I would
definitely<00:05:12.630> suggest<00:05:12.780> finding<00:05:13.350> sets<00:05:13.890> of<00:05:14.190> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
definitely suggest finding sets of the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.270 
definitely suggest finding sets of the
larger<00:05:15.630> ones<00:05:15.840> instead<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.380> this<00:05:16.530> combo<00:05:16.980> set<00:05:17.160> of

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
larger ones instead of this combo set of

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.450 
larger ones instead of this combo set of
the<00:05:17.370> large<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.850> small<00:05:18.890> they<00:05:19.890> you<00:05:20.280> can

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
slip off onto the blade because there's

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.020
