usually there's cheaper bars for like 60
70<00:02:54.220> but<00:02:54.790> 80<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.209> kind<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.630> lot<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.020> I<00:02:56.950> mean

because it's ten dollars cheaper but the

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.500 
because it's ten dollars cheaper but the
hub<00:05:41.080> guard<00:05:41.350> was<00:05:41.830> $25<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.820> I<00:05:42.850> got<00:05:43.030> that<00:05:43.210> as<00:05:43.330> well
