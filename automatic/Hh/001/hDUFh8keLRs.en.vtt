definitely<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.240> first<00:01:32.540> thing<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.900> had<00:01:33.080> on<00:01:33.200> my

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230

mind<00:01:35.980> okay<00:01:37.240> there<00:01:38.240> are<00:01:38.270> basically<00:01:38.870> three

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
mind okay there are basically three

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.180 
mind okay there are basically three
phases<00:01:39.800> wait<00:01:40.460> no<00:01:40.610> three<00:01:41.120> or<00:01:41.210> four<00:01:41.950> first<00:01:42.950> phase

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
phases wait no three or four first phase

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.550 
phases wait no three or four first phase
just<00:01:43.700> run<00:01:43.910> around<00:01:44.920> until<00:01:45.920> he<00:01:46.160> becomes<00:01:46.460> small

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
just run around until he becomes small

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.020 
just run around until he becomes small
wacom<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.770> then<00:01:49.580> you're<00:01:49.700> done<00:01:49.730> with<00:01:50.000> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
wacom and then you're done with that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.920 
wacom and then you're done with that
vase<00:01:51.370> second<00:01:52.370> phase<00:01:52.550> you'll<00:01:53.120> only<00:01:53.330> be<00:01:53.570> on<00:01:53.660> one

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
vase second phase you'll only be on one

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.860 
vase second phase you'll only be on one
platform<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:55.160> run<00:01:55.790> from<00:01:56.030> side<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.420> side<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
platform so run from side to side on the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.290 
platform so run from side to side on the
platform<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.790> personally<00:01:58.790> think<00:01:58.910> this<00:01:59.120> is<00:01:59.270> a

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
platform I personally think this is a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.670 
platform I personally think this is a
little<00:01:59.510> bit<00:01:59.630> easier<00:01:59.750> than<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.230> first<00:02:00.380> phase

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
little bit easier than the first phase

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.500 
little bit easier than the first phase
even<00:02:01.040> because<00:02:01.370> it<00:02:01.880> leaves<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.330> more

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
even because it leaves you more

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.350 
even because it leaves you more
available<00:02:02.960> sometimes<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.220> will<00:02:04.490> over<00:02:05.030> jump

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
available sometimes you will over jump

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.920 
available sometimes you will over jump
and<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.820> you'll<00:02:07.820> miss<00:02:08.090> him<00:02:08.330> when<00:02:08.360> he<00:02:08.630> become

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
and then you'll miss him when he become

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.640 
and then you'll miss him when he become
small<00:02:11.530> okay<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.800> one<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:14.330> platform<00:02:14.930> lowers

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
small okay this one the platform lowers

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.460 
small okay this one the platform lowers
after<00:02:16.520> he<00:02:16.700> jumps<00:02:17.210> on<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.440> be

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
after he jumps on it so you have to be

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800 
after he jumps on it so you have to be
ready<00:02:18.710> for<00:02:19.070> when<00:02:19.220> he<00:02:19.520> see<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.660> was
