00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello, today we look at this 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.160
 knife note how huge u 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 it is the length of this knife 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.770
 take measure what we have here 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.880
 it turns out here 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 let's get this a little less on 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:33.410
 affected the error is obtained from 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 we are here for three three hundred and seventy 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 three millimeters total length but it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 some huge should be such already 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 the sword is literally when we extract it from 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 scabbard see that he is still essentially 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 less it even makes me happy 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.149
 probably such a huge sword like me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.899
 suppose the very beginning was to be 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.149
 completely uncomfortable working means here 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.149
 us the length is already 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 303 somewhere millimeter that already 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.580
 not at all, but more generally 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 It turns out such a working tool this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.530
 the knife has absolutely no 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.830
 Absolutely no marks 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.360
 firms here are no glue there anything on 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.920
 it is not detected by me and accordingly 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 say about its manufacturers whether else what 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.550
 something I can not you I guess 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.860
 that this is a handmade knife or a knife can 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.460
 to be such as they call him Zon 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.979
 work 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 that is most likely in general it 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.450
 pretty close almost the same 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.940
 well at least this knife was made 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.550
 in my opinion not in the factory at some 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.110
 do-it- yourself production 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.300
 some kind of very skillful man 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.360
 here has a serious subdue 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.009
 notch very serious emphasis on the hour here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.660
 metal part goes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.930
 and you know this handle is just gorgeous 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.690
 It falls into my hand that it is clear that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.730
 did the man himself manually not 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.360
 not a copy of some kind of some kind of model 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.250
 the knife 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:30.810
 then it is probably just very big 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.100
 master and do not even know gorgeous he apparently 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.049
 can make knives 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.720
 far his not the first knife should be but 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.810
 although maybe it's some kind of copy or 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.090
 maybe it was somehow removed 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.049
 the inscription all the producers do not know 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.190
 but the knife is excellent in the hand here 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.640
 there is a notch on the butt 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.520
 under the thumb can hold it like 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.840
 direct fencing grip there in general 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.530
 then reverse how would you keep it 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.540
 very very comfortable it falls in hand and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.190
 makes a great impression blade 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.300
 here is fully polished then here 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.910
 the only thing that really bothers me 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.140
 because on self-made pressure i 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.180
 I often see that the blade is not enough 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.310
 quality polished somewhere there 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.560
 some flaws here them practically 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.240
 imperceptibly somewhat so concave 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.890
 descents 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.360
 used on this knife long here 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 There is such a pretty but imitation 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.350
 let's say so saw 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.810
 if you can see it all the same not 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.930
 saw in my opinion but what is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.390
 design decision and i think that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.830
 such knives 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.770
 who make our 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.470
 Russian craftsmen are really 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.620
 very very high quality produce 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.410
 gorgeous impression and to me this our 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.890
 really like it i think that for 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.550
 some such serious work somewhere 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.460
 there is something to chop planing maybe 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.380
 There, butchering this knife is great 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:16.190
 nice to hold it in your hands 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.400
 nice design and buy such knives 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.120
 probably not really worth it 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.970
 the Internet 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 no way in my opinion namely 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.360
 if you come to the store take it to 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.210
 hand he lays down to you pleases your eye then 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.890
 have that knife which really 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:40.970
 will like that will lay your hand 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:43.820
 it will be worth the purchase and I 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.400
 I assume that the price of such a knife 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.280
 will not be very high not very high 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 but he will cope with very 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.830
 many works 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.360
 easy at ease that's well i'm not 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.820
 tested this steel 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.960
 again the knife was given by mine 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.139
 familiar to the review and in general I'm so 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.080
 I understand that here 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.819
 some kind of there and from in the test of meaning 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:20.689
 hold no but whatever was here 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:23.439
 I liked this steel, I think 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.930
 that this is not a candid clay and 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:29.080
 accordingly , otherwise disappoint 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.409
 he just can't 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:37.819
 cool fixed I like to know more 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:42.319
 its real price in general it would be 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:45.409
 generally interesting to weigh his weight 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.360
 now it is difficult to hang it makes no sense 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:51.289
 By the way why I also think that he is 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:55.069
 handmade need here enters page i 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:59.660
 I think that many people living in Russia know 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.880
 what does it mean 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:07.250
 you are so we have a company that 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:11.800
 produces various there need holsters and 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.630
 so on in general they were chosen 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.780
 there were apparently no others for the knife 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.040
 availability had to take so big so 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.040
 what do we have there with weight 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:34.379
 271 grams for such a serious knife on 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.810
 my opinion is quite good if at all 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.740
 forgot whether I measured in my opinion did not measure 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:45.500
 the length of the blade let's measure the total length 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:50.150
 blade 182 millimeter 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:53.419
 cutting edge length 175 mm 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.840
 such a very very impressive knife 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.840
 I hope you were interested
