00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
next one is called body count I'm not

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.200 
next one is called body count I'm not
entirely<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.550> actually<00:02:23.820> modeled

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
entirely sure this is actually modeled

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.930 
entirely sure this is actually modeled
off<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> ready<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:26.160> think

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
off but it's just like a ready I think

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700 
off but it's just like a ready I think
it's<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.180> patterns<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.900> bones<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.590> or

it's got patterns of bones in it or
something<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.490> finally<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.360> one

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
something like that and finally this one

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.480 
something like that and finally this one
is<00:02:30.750> called<00:02:31.020> kiss<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.440> death<00:02:31.740> now<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.280> like

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
is called kiss of death now this is like

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.940 
is called kiss of death now this is like
a<00:02:32.520> school<00:02:33.060> pattern<00:02:33.600> with<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> bit<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.680> white<00:02:34.920> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
a school pattern with a bit of white and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160 
a school pattern with a bit of white and
pinky<00:02:35.700> reddy<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.090> perfectly<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:37.050> as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
pinky reddy and perfectly in there as

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.070 
pinky reddy and perfectly in there as
well<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.790> kind<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.940> similar<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.300> body<00:02:39.570> count<00:02:39.900> in

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.510 
well so kind of similar to body count in
the<00:02:40.200> way<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.440> looks<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:40.860> they<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.490> very

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520

standard<00:02:47.430> boring<00:02:47.940> ones<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.870> some

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
standard boring ones there are some

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.540 
standard boring ones there are some
actually<00:02:49.410> pretty<00:02:49.560> cool<00:02:49.830> ones<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.220> there<00:02:50.370> so
