with<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.209> when<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.079> was<00:03:07.290> just<00:03:07.530> him<00:03:07.680> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
with it when it was just him and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.650 
with it when it was just him and
squirrel<00:03:08.099> flight<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.519> then<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:09.299> kind<00:03:09.569> of

much after that and I thought that was

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.550 
much after that and I thought that was
sad<00:03:13.379> um<00:03:13.799> him<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.760> squirrel<00:03:15.120> fight<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:16.260> not<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
sad um him and squirrel fight it's not a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.150 
sad um him and squirrel fight it's not a
bad<00:03:17.190> couple<00:03:17.700> but<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.269> also<00:03:18.510> not<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.290> great

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
bad couple but it's also not a great

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.319 
bad couple but it's also not a great
couple<00:03:20.549> in<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.150> opinion<00:03:21.780> um<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.730> sweet<00:03:24.090> you

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
couple in my opinion um it's sweet you

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.750 
couple in my opinion um it's sweet you
know<00:03:24.389> like<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:25.530> she<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:26.010> apprentice<00:03:26.549> and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
know like when she was in apprentice and

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.099 
know like when she was in apprentice and
I<00:03:26.849> think<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> was<00:03:27.329> somewhere<00:03:27.660> along<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
I think it was somewhere along the

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.580 
I think it was somewhere along the
journey<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:29.389> she<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:30.599> saved<00:03:30.930> him<00:03:31.290> from

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
journey and she like saved him from

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.589 
journey and she like saved him from
drowning<00:03:31.859> or<00:03:32.340> whatever<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:32.819> guess<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.450> was

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
drowning or whatever I guess that was

thought it was a weird decision because

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.580 
thought it was a weird decision because
I<00:06:45.680> think<00:06:45.710> she's<00:06:46.070> a<00:06:46.690> okay<00:06:47.690> deputy<00:06:47.900> she's<00:06:48.410> not

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
than her honestly but also I might make

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.360 
than her honestly but also I might make
a<00:07:00.890> separate<00:07:01.400> rant<00:07:01.580> about<00:07:01.730> this<00:07:02.030> later<00:07:02.330> but

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
rambles star that's just a weird name to

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.490 
rambles star that's just a weird name to
me<00:07:07.490> it<00:07:07.910> doesn't<00:07:08.120> make<00:07:08.300> much<00:07:08.570> sense<00:07:08.600> a<00:07:09.170> star

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
me it doesn't make much sense a star

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.440 
me it doesn't make much sense a star
mean<00:07:09.740> of<00:07:09.860> brambles<00:07:10.400> or<00:07:11.470> a<00:07:12.730> star<00:07:13.730> in<00:07:14.030> the<00:07:14.150> shape

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
mean of brambles or a star in the shape

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.280 
mean of brambles or a star in the shape
of<00:07:14.630> the<00:07:14.690> brand

of the brand

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.200 
of the brand
although<00:07:15.890> Bramwell<00:07:16.280> quoi<00:07:16.490> doesn't<00:07:16.880> make<00:07:17.000> much

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
although Bramwell quoi doesn't make much

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.900 
although Bramwell quoi doesn't make much
sense<00:07:17.240> either<00:07:17.780> so<00:07:18.260> I<00:07:18.670> don't<00:07:19.670> really<00:07:19.790> have

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
sense either so I don't really have

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.400 
sense either so I don't really have
anything<00:07:20.120> else<00:07:20.300> to<00:07:20.540> say<00:07:20.780> so<00:07:20.810> I<00:07:21.110> guess<00:07:21.170> it's

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
anything else to say so I guess it's

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.380
