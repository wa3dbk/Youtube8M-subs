00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.820
 welcome again here is my 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.630
 extinct and today I will teach you how to troll 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 to your classmates 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 here as you see we have a fairness and two 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.980
 tables to build things but what 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.200
 you see is that it is something natural 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.260
 everything looks normal 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.510
 they see something strange to the clear not but a 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 Once your classmates say they have 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.270
 some flowers that the simón fig lends me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 what here is what then you already know a 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.680
 time they're going to come and you know they're going to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.120
 put their already you know they are going to cook what 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.730
 who want to cook once 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 kick the forts will take away 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.030
 a surprise 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.089
 how much will it be or not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840
 and snot 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.030
 let 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.230
 will give in the mother but if now they 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.950
 I will teach how to make this trap 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.670
 what is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.390
 full- blown 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.300
 good for this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.400
 troll for this cliché would not be of 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.990
 cliché now to troll your 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.100
 partners we will need a fairness 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.570
 according to what you are using to decorate 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.870
 we will need the redstone 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.650
 indicates that it is dynamite 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.230
 and we will need red stone torches 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.130
 and we will also need a bottle of 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.540
 Water 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.760
 tip 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.040
 something else that I'm not forgetting the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.330
 tables so that they decorate and so that they do not 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.480
 see suspect already you know 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.160
 well once having all this already 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.640
 next to the flowers where they have 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.550
 placed we will make a hole of a 212 and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.550
 then we will make a hole just below the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.820
 flowers after doing that we will place 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.440
 his bowl will put the water here 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.440
 then then where is the frenzy 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.450
 and this will make the water no longer go 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.910
 for the left once we'll do that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.340
 two hole next to the flowers 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.450
 as you see the water is no longer going to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.750
 there 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 if that is not there if you are not giving more 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.670
 giving to the left you did it wrong and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.620
 you will need to try again because 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.900
 we need the water to be just going 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.930
 for there for the moment although once 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.620
 done this we will get here and here 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.010
 we will place the first network torch 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.290
 stones 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.450
 and then we'll break this around 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.500
 then here we will place the first 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.420
 Red stone 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 and then we'll make another hole for 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.250
 below and we will place another 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.220
 these will have to be lit if not 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.190
 they are on is that something is wrong 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.280
 but good after we'll talk another 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.680
 arribita and we will place the other torch 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.550
 red what this will do is that this will 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.880
 turn off 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.280
 and how do you see if I want a red torch 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.670
 first the other one will learn what is it 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.670
 What we want 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.760
 this has to be off now 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.980
 we will make a hole here that they can 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.350
 do as big what they want to do and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.360
 we will place dynamite 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.370
 down everything here 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.510
 and then when you have placed your 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.269
 dynamite we will start to cover everything 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.130
 it's there and it's there good now 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.650
 we will place the tables next to 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.300
 of the flowers so nobody suspects 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.460
 nothing and say a fucking mother that that 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.210
 It's water but you will not see it because it's 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.530
 closed 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.300
 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.390
 good 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.600
 when a partner comes and asks you if 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.450
 you have some flowers that you can use 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.940
 tell him Simon is there and when he comes to 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.150
 use them fairness and place 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.530
 something and this walking that will make the 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.530
 water go to the right side 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.830
 activate the dynamites 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.169
 to be here cooking my account of what 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.180
 what is happening is la la la la and 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.900
 snot fucking 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.449
 see you mate 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.780
 that has been all for now I hope that 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.780
 you liked it 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.509
