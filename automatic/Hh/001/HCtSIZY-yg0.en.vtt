00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:02.929 
all right right now I'm changing the

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.769 
all right right now I'm changing the
thermostat<00:00:03.560> on<00:00:03.590> the<00:00:03.770> 300<00:00:04.340> here<00:00:04.609> I<00:00:04.819> had<00:00:05.569> to<00:00:05.660> do

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
thermostat on the 300 here I had to do

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.640 
thermostat on the 300 here I had to do
quite<00:00:06.080> a<00:00:06.109> bit<00:00:06.169> of<00:00:06.319> stuff<00:00:06.649> to<00:00:06.799> get<00:00:06.950> this<00:00:07.160> out<00:00:08.470> but

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.090 

it's<00:00:13.090> probably<00:00:14.090> a<00:00:14.290> three<00:00:15.290> out<00:00:15.440> of<00:00:15.470> five<00:00:15.740> on

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
it's probably a three out of five on

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.150 
it's probably a three out of five on
difficulty<00:00:16.880> maybe<00:00:17.720> two<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.289> don't<00:00:18.919> know<00:00:18.980> it's

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
difficulty maybe two I don't know it's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.560 
difficulty maybe two I don't know it's
not<00:00:19.279> really<00:00:19.580> that<00:00:19.609> difficult

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
not really that difficult

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.300 
not really that difficult
the<00:00:21.199> main<00:00:21.380> problem<00:00:21.830> was<00:00:21.949> getting<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
the main problem was getting the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.300 
the main problem was getting the
radiator<00:00:22.759> out<00:00:23.109> which<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:24.560> do<00:00:24.679> that<00:00:24.859> I<00:00:24.890> had<00:00:25.279> to

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
radiator out which to do that I had to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.300 
radiator out which to do that I had to
remove<00:00:25.699> this<00:00:25.880> bolt<00:00:25.939> here<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:26.829> take<00:00:27.829> off<00:00:28.039> this

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
remove this bolt here and take off this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.140 
remove this bolt here and take off this
pipe<00:00:28.669> that<00:00:29.029> connects<00:00:29.359> these<00:00:29.900> two<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:31.150> that

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
pipe that connects these two and that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.180 
pipe that connects these two and that
allowed<00:00:32.509> me<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.750> move<00:00:33.020> this<00:00:33.200> forward<00:00:33.590> some<00:00:33.950> so

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
allowed me to move this forward some so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.730 
allowed me to move this forward some so
I<00:00:34.220> could<00:00:34.430> squeeze<00:00:34.760> my<00:00:34.970> radiator<00:00:35.330> past<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.900> in

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
I could squeeze my radiator past it in

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.680 
I could squeeze my radiator past it in
order<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:36.980> get<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.220> radiator<00:00:37.580> off<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.570> have

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
order to get the radiator off you have

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.410 
order to get the radiator off you have
to<00:00:38.840> take<00:00:38.990> off<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.320> fan<00:00:39.530> shroud<00:00:39.820> which<00:00:40.820> is<00:00:41.150> over

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
to take off the fan shroud which is over

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.330 
to take off the fan shroud which is over
here<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:43.160> is<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.310> two-piece<00:00:43.880> shroud<00:00:44.860> so<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:45.920> can

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
here it is a two-piece shroud so you can

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.520 
here it is a two-piece shroud so you can
take<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.700> off<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.060> leave<00:00:47.570> your<00:00:47.750> clutch<00:00:48.050> fan<00:00:48.260> on

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
as you can see this is the part that

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.260 
as you can see this is the part that
gets<00:00:51.890> caught<00:00:52.220> on<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.460> clutch<00:00:52.700> fan<00:00:52.940> when<00:00:53.210> you

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
gets caught on the clutch fan when you

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.200 
gets caught on the clutch fan when you
go<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.450> take<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.720> off<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.860> got<00:00:55.130> one<00:00:56.090> large

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
clip over here it clips in one on this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.980

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
side and that one there flips it down

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.550 
side and that one there flips it down
here<00:01:03.549> but<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:04.729> take<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:04.939> off<00:01:05.359> and<00:01:05.780> also<00:01:06.289> past

here but you take that off and also past
clutch<00:01:06.859> fan<00:01:07.659> or<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:08.749> can<00:01:08.899> take<00:01:09.020> much<00:01:09.350> fan<00:01:09.590> off

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
clutch fan or you can take much fan off

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.099 
clutch fan or you can take much fan off
first<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:10.429> had<00:01:10.789> to<00:01:10.820> take<00:01:11.060> clutch<00:01:11.390> fan<00:01:11.570> off<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.049> I

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
first I had to take clutch fan off so I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.709 
first I had to take clutch fan off so I
could<00:01:12.200> get<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.649> pipe<00:01:12.969> much<00:01:13.969> fan<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.450> held

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
could get to the pipe much fan is held

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.669 
could get to the pipe much fan is held
on<00:01:14.899> by<00:01:15.079> these<00:01:15.289> four<00:01:15.590> bolts<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.340> there's

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.349

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
showing that's the front side of the pan

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.309 
showing that's the front side of the pan
and<00:01:24.490> clearly<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:25.880> hasn't<00:01:26.600> been<00:01:26.630> taken<00:01:27.079> care

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
and clearly this hasn't been taken care

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.379 
and clearly this hasn't been taken care
of<00:01:27.380> there's<00:01:27.829> there<00:01:28.399> spots<00:01:28.880> all<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.210> way

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
of there's there spots all the way

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
around this is the upper radiator hose

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.899 
around this is the upper radiator hose
there<00:01:32.780> see<00:01:32.960> radiator<00:01:33.439> it's<00:01:33.740> still<00:01:34.429> grading

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
there see radiator it's still grading

OEM this is a fail-safe and what that is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.709 
OEM this is a fail-safe and what that is
is<00:01:48.079> when<00:01:48.679> this<00:01:48.859> goes<00:01:49.069> bad<00:01:49.369> these<00:01:50.149> little<00:01:50.509> pins

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
is when this goes bad these little pins

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.309 
is when this goes bad these little pins
here<00:01:50.990> keep<00:01:51.829> keep<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:52.969> open<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.659> your<00:01:54.079> car

to<00:02:17.860> figure<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:19.320> probably<00:02:20.320> about<00:02:20.380> half

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
to figure this out probably about half

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520 
to figure this out probably about half
an<00:02:20.890> hour<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.220> an<00:02:21.250> hour<00:02:21.490> online<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:23.110> get<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
an hour to an hour online to get to the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.530 
an hour to an hour online to get to the
thermostat<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.700> you've<00:02:24.880> got<00:02:25.030> everything<00:02:25.300> out

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
thermostat and you've got everything out

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.170 
thermostat and you've got everything out
like<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:25.900> now<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:27.780> undo<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:29.040> pipe<00:02:30.180> which

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
like it is now you undo this pipe which

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540 
like it is now you undo this pipe which
is<00:02:31.210> held<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:31.990> by<00:02:32.050> three<00:02:32.440> bolts<00:02:32.770> I'll<00:02:33.130> show<00:02:33.490> you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
is held on by three bolts I'll show you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.320 
is held on by three bolts I'll show you
in<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.790> second

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
in a second

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.180 
in a second
go<00:02:35.230> undo<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.870> your<00:02:38.050> thermostat<00:02:38.590> sits<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
go undo that and your thermostat sits in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.720 
go undo that and your thermostat sits in
there<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:40.660> right<00:02:40.959> as<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.400> still

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
there all right as you can see I still

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.360 
there all right as you can see I still
need<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.970> clean<00:02:43.180> mine<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.630> little<00:02:43.870> bit

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
need to clean mine up a little bit

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.890 
need to clean mine up a little bit
because<00:02:45.370> somebody<00:02:45.910> had<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> rubber<00:02:46.390> gasket<00:02:46.540> on

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
because somebody had a rubber gasket on

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.430 
because somebody had a rubber gasket on
there<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.320> need<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.650> clean<00:02:47.860> all<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> up<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:49.440> my

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
there I need to clean all that up and my

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.960 
there I need to clean all that up and my
thermostat<00:02:50.800> will<00:02:51.130> sit<00:02:51.400> down<00:02:51.430> inside<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.150> there

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
thermostat will sit down inside of there

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.570 
thermostat will sit down inside of there
now<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.050> goes<00:02:56.290> together<00:02:56.580> your

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
now how this goes together your

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
now how this goes together your
thermostat<00:02:58.120> sits<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:59.050> this<00:03:00.270> up<00:03:01.270> against

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
thermostat sits like this up against

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500 
thermostat sits like this up against
this<00:03:01.750> pipe<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:03.130> rests<00:03:03.610> inside<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
this pipe and this rests inside of the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.870 
this pipe and this rests inside of the
motor<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.950> will<00:03:06.040> actually<00:03:06.370> sit<00:03:06.580> up<00:03:06.700> in

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
motor so it will actually sit up in

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.580 
motor so it will actually sit up in
there<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.330> these<00:03:07.600> prongs<00:03:09.060> now<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.600> get<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:11.440> get

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
there on these prongs now to get to get

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.420 
there on these prongs now to get to get
that<00:03:11.620> pipe<00:03:11.980> off<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.910> bolt<00:03:13.860> which<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that pipe off this bolt which is that

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.460 
that pipe off this bolt which is that
bolt<00:03:15.700> hole<00:03:15.910> there<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:17.220> had<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.340> use<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:18.820> wrench

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
bolt hole there I had to use this wrench

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.400 
bolt hole there I had to use this wrench
this<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.739> an<00:03:21.130> 8<00:03:21.400> millimeter<00:03:21.910> allen<00:03:22.150> wrench

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
this is an 8 millimeter allen wrench

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.930 
this is an 8 millimeter allen wrench
make<00:03:23.410> sure<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.190> long<00:03:24.400> enough<00:03:24.730> I

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
make sure you have one long enough I

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.610 
make sure you have one long enough I
didn't<00:03:25.269> have<00:03:25.390> one<00:03:25.600> long<00:03:25.989> enough<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:26.410> had<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
didn't have one long enough and I had to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.330 
didn't have one long enough and I had to
go<00:03:26.739> get<00:03:26.920> another<00:03:27.100> one

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
go get another one

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.130 
go get another one
that's<00:03:27.880> also<00:03:28.180> why<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.330> have<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.630> D<00:03:28.840> handle

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
that's also why I have this D handle

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.949 
that's also why I have this D handle
here<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:33.130> need<00:03:33.310> an<00:03:33.700> 8<00:03:34.060> millimeter<00:03:34.299> allen

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
here but you need an 8 millimeter allen

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.979 
here but you need an 8 millimeter allen
wrench<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> 12<00:03:36.730> millimeter<00:03:36.970> socket<00:03:37.720> for

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
wrench and a 12 millimeter socket for

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.250 
wrench and a 12 millimeter socket for
these<00:03:38.350> bolts<00:03:38.799> which<00:03:39.989> go<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.170> those<00:03:41.440> studs<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
these bolts which go on those studs and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.259 
these bolts which go on those studs and
that's<00:03:44.860> pretty<00:03:45.790> much<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:48.510> reverse<00:03:49.510> process

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
that's pretty much it reverse process
