and I don't wear extensions every day
but<00:00:19.289> now<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> think<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> might<00:00:20.460> because<00:00:21.240> um<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
but now I think I might because um I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.560 
but now I think I might because um I
found<00:00:22.769> an<00:00:22.980> amazing<00:00:23.160> brand<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> extensions<00:00:24.269> and

found an amazing brand of extensions and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
found an amazing brand of extensions and
reason<00:00:25.439> why<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> couldn't<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.609> give<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
reason why I couldn't really give a

reason why I couldn't really give a
straight<00:00:27.150> answer<00:00:27.180> before<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
straight answer before is because I

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
straight answer before is because I

them or something like that now the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
them or something like that now the
first<00:01:05.400> thing<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.729> know<00:01:05.790> stuff<00:01:06.119> about<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
first thing I know stuff about was this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
first thing I know stuff about was this
was<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.200> big<00:01:07.619> hair<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.689> opened<00:01:09.689> it

up I think this is about the same amount
of<00:01:12.270> hair<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.020> guys<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.070> tell<00:01:14.570> like
