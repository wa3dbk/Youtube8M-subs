00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.079
 little things 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.609
 so let me lose 5 ac and 1 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.350
 So this is going to be here is a 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.879
 home is always automatic you can see 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.749
 there in front does not have a home in a 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.100
 report 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:54.379
 this is the center here as we go 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.510
 tell the rain panel control room 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.209
 that back when he will shake 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.790
 look like a house there but before you press 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:06.710
 I wanted to thank all of you who 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 always helping me and giving there and favorite 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.350
 the goal in the video 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.480
 this is very important for the channel 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.220
 so let's go guys, I'm very happy 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.670
 with these four thousand subscribers waiting 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.020
 reach a higher goal next year 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.700
 I want to come, God, I want to pretend 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.549
 buy one 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.039
 It was then that the push here is the house 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.719
 will appear this command that 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.780
 showed up at the house command 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.960
 talk call call and come on, you come 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.289
 the load 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.750
 So you can see the house appeared 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.960
 100% automatic I did not put a block 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.060
 in her here comment that you see here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.170
 supporting the house since on television 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.459
 zinho here we see on television one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.829
 bonfire or the fig trees there 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:03.470
 those basic things chose the danger 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.049
 is done here but so is the house 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.539
 simple not very detailed that gives much 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.370
 article 30 which I read in 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.489
 corny but it 's good now I will show 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.680
 You, the system that's in the house was 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:25.670
 who goes there but then it's here that everything 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.530
 works here are gomes commands no 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 I know how many blocks like here 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.739
 I think it is well over 200 for 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.340
 you be more visible but without us 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.920
 has 200 flights and finally 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.080
 here everything happens here makes the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 because it's hot the command that is the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.050
 seventh rider makes his mona the block 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.180
 environment 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.870
 place in the coordinates and in a video 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.720
 future bet explaining this command 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.330
 here and here I think that side here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.120
 It's the part of the wall down here and it has 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.260
 the time if this because it is part of the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.600
 goal is to achieve there and here below is 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.700
 this guys here yet is home to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:16.780
 had this here did not come home and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.120
 that one central in the beginning there is that 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.000
 Makes a phone call that added a blog to the publisher. 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 here that connects all these 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.120
 blocks lets rise aquino only find the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:38.410
 so this is what this is the video 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:42.010
 of 55 thousand 4 thousand subscribers is not 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.150
 the video so so so so so 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.310
 simplistic but it's what I found the best 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.570
 to enroll 4 thousand already had 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.420
 done 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.490
 however by excluding the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.090
 I format the pc and forget that saving the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.220
 The Constitution will then make you short but
