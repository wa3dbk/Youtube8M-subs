00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to all the youtubers that see my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.270
 videos today I bring you the new list of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 prohibited letters December 2013 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.290
 as you will remember in the previous list 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 they had announced that they would take out the new 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 list every 4 months and then this time take 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 this list that in my opinion was very 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 good so I'll show you in the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 prohibited they put to sixth sense and the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.460
 reason was because it gave an advantage 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 extreme if they were right on the die and even if 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 I could not get it right I gave you a cemetery and 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 that was a big advantage for the lords 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.640
 dragons the chaos dragon 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.860
 even the armed sirens the next 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 is self destruct button this letter towards 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.180
 what duel is tied if your opponent 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.280
 earned by 7000 points of life and as 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 there were letters that increased the points 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 of the opponent's life you record a tie 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.180
 very sure the next letter is the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.219
 return of the different dimension you pay 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 half to invoke so many removed 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 to the field as possible and in the decks 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.039
 that moved the asshole did that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.039
 this letter out the win letter in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.050
 numerous times the next is the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.149
 dragon field ages being 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.189
 I honestly do not know why forbid that letter 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.750
 if they had already fucked the dragon lord and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.420
 this makes the dragons 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 be pure slow shit anyway 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.130
 you comment and say that you 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.830
 they seemed the letters that they banned 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.500

 I was waiting for them and well I have a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.990
 friend who had been saying for weeks 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.430
 magic book of destiny this letter 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560

 strategies and almost always was the letter 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.550
 of the win this was one of the changes that 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 I liked it more, although for those who use 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.470
 magic book will not affect anything this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.270
 keep in mind the following are the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.440

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 great advantage the following is account
