00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.370
 88 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.740
 I just want a good damn 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 explanation of this are 24 hours later 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.900
 who goes to war 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 in the previous night with triples is 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.200
 great batista one of these end 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 resigning to promote his film 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 and one of the members of our 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.570
 favorites desio ends up joining the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.790
 demon incarnated triple h but if you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.210
 I have to report that I did not see the show in 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.850
 I live because of personal things but for 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 what was going when I arrived at my home I went 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 to twitter and I did not listen I did not listen 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 I read nothing good about a show of this 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.840
 edition moon the night world unique good 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 I had heard is that they are cinema and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.070
 stephanie make me they were in a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 segment and that stephanie put on a daily basis 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.289
 brain an expression fight more against 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 came if it recovers soon or yes 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.020
 do not 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.580
 for the first time the world titles the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 great place 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.180
 in the money in the bank goldman sachs 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.120
 another reads the 1 super disgusting suite of 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.560
 how was the show I thought nothing big 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.100
 could happen in this edition but until 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 the image that I saw on the computer in the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 internet where problems attacked and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.330
 Roman betrayed rails and team Ambrós 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.940
 and joined triple hy is randy orton 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.370
 after batista resigned for second 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.130
 time to promote his movies the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:12.040
 guardians of the galaxy at the moment 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 I felt super annoying super sad in 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.560
 serious I did not know that blames the fast 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.300
 I started blaming batista because he left 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.280
 but in truth it seems that because of me 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.790
 It has nothing new to do with jude 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.550
 I think this is something new for 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.040
 another page and it was good because it was 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.860
 something surprising usually I thought 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.590
 that was going to be team ambros at the time 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 let it be because in the future it was this 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.450
 inevitable future 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.400
 true that they ended days 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.549
 pressing is breaking you 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.120
 but without ambrós in mine to do the 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.480
 that betray others and not be 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.780
 robbins as I said was the last segment 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.400
 it was good it was surprising but due to 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.829
 that the show had bad reviews can 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.799
 be that this segment has a low 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.959
 rating because the road show gave 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.849
 too much for what I read for what I've 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.520
 seen are I really hope that this 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.520
 video and not 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.220
 do not take the blame to be freelance in 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.460
 this new moment of betrayal of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.760
 decision since the show hour after hour 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.970
 I was going worse as I tell you 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.510
 I was super annoying this decision was 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.410
 my favorite faction in the last five 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.250
 years of debt they were so over 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.520
 with the fans and the three members 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.130
 They had something essential in itself ramón 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 reigns the powerhouse the boy of 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.980
 destination the dark water generation super 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.460
 star samoano team ambrós one of the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.340
 best independent fighters that I know 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.510
 that can bring a crazy character by itself 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.190
 alone and be proven the agile the crazy and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.310
 I understand why they chose six 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.410
 many rounds were said that if they 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.720
 they broke by román range already had the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.050
 hey let's say we also made soft could 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.210
 do the least to give development 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.970
 but I think now that he left with 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.790
 evolution 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.210
 things can be there 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.950
 balanced as well and in the history of 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.810
 these last two years that these 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.560
 boys made him champions in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.910
 couples champion in the usa in the last 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.440
 they beat 31 world championships 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.650
 combined in evolution 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.330
 they had two consecutive victories in 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.660
 summary already dominated the rhein night after 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.730
 night being the best faction in my 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.920
 opinion in the past five or seven 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.740
 years I just hope that in the next 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.290
 edition so that there is a very good 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.540
 explanation of why you are likely 24 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.820
 hours after payback that went to the 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.290
 war with triple evolution h candy 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.850
 Orton and Batista joined the demon 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.850
 embodied triple h 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.400
 apparently money does speak for itself 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.370
