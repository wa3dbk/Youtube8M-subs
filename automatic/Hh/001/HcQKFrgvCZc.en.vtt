00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.820
 houston project that I had visited about two years ago I think 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.709
 the filaments that interested me in its current application ie 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.269
 it's an airplane that can 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.389
 pushed on there if the co-pilot 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.060
 this new proposal 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.109
 so good it's completely different from our steak using a project 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 on the ice is basically for this project first of all energy saving 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.350
 so we're growing energy savings as far as possible in 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 using the latest technologies 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.069
 so that it allows us to fly 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.979
 kardec renewable energy in this case only with energy 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.630
 solar serve as relay really without fuel 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.330
 and two flights so without pollution and without generation thimotÃ© these objectives 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.500
 are very different afp but we try to make me a plane that goes 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.150
 weigh the fifth 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.820
 in this a glider 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.700
 e 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.910
 the glider of flight of a glider of high performances 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.610
 so the fifth it requires new technologies it requires 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 a new multi-site approach to new materials 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 these necessities of new manufacturing processes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.159
 for that nothing more simple the two years of reign of paul still unknown 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.020
 never explored 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.460
 so here too it's clear that death is an infrastructure a reflection 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.600
 a preparation that is completely different compared to an airplane that 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.990
 come back to him traditional in his approach 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.470
 I think the audience will appreciate I the difference to the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 vision difference 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.780
 I think the project the project was scared it's an interesting project 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.340
 also because it's a search in one of these new forms of 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.110
 propulsion so I think that's quite his merit 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.990
 the future will be made of different solutions 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.039
 e 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.680
 the particularity of course to a thigh 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.950
 it's really about being able to fly 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.880
 day and night over several days so develop a little bit 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 a perpetual flight concept and that's clear it's absolutely unique 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.210
 it's absolutely new 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.270
 and I think to tell it as such it's a project that yesterday I think 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 maybe more visionary and what we are trying to go much further in 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.200
 its goal enough to open a new path is to open a new door 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 it's not money in filaments with this project but it's 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.069
 really to show a new path ayata for example set itself as 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 objective in 2050 to have for any pollution no emission in fact to 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 lower them to zero emission ze for transport aircraft 2057 in 42 years 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.009
 42 43 years old so it's soon here 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.439
 the difference with the sector first step in this direction 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.549
 % today we have this is a growth of air transport prayer on church 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.059
 the next few out of his quest saying he had almost doubled 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:52.889
 planned energy savings are simply 40 to 45 percent 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.369
 at 50% 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.789
 it means that for the use of fossil fuels is swallowed in 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.349
 increase is to say that the production of these waters values 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.139
 of increase it means that we have to find new forms and 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.159
 to make new infections
