well here we are again I just wanted to

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.630 
well here we are again I just wanted to
show<00:00:06.189> you<00:00:06.250> the<00:00:07.590> wood<00:00:08.590> stove<00:00:08.860> I<00:00:09.100> made<00:00:09.370> out<00:00:09.610> of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 
show you the wood stove I made out of

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.280 
show you the wood stove I made out of
the<00:00:09.940> 20<00:00:10.600> millimeter<00:00:11.070> ammo<00:00:12.070> can<00:00:13.140> there<00:00:14.140> is<00:00:14.170> a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
the 20 millimeter ammo can there is a

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.670 
the 20 millimeter ammo can there is a
picture<00:00:15.070> it's<00:00:15.730> about<00:00:15.880> 6<00:00:16.870> o'clock<00:00:16.990> right<00:00:17.500> now

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
picture it's about 6 o'clock right now

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.580 
picture it's about 6 o'clock right now
it's<00:00:18.490> been<00:00:18.700> burning<00:00:18.940> for<00:00:19.360> about<00:00:19.390> maybe<00:00:20.020> 20

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
it's been burning for about maybe 20

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.940 
it's been burning for about maybe 20
minutes<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:21.820> is<00:00:22.000> hardly<00:00:22.450> any<00:00:22.780> smoke<00:00:23.170> you

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
minutes there is hardly any smoke you

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.650 
minutes there is hardly any smoke you
can't<00:00:24.190> even<00:00:24.310> see<00:00:24.580> smoke<00:00:24.880> coming<00:00:24.910> out<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.420> this

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
can't even see smoke coming out of this

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
can't even see smoke coming out of this
deck<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.789> we're<00:00:27.789> gonna<00:00:27.910> go<00:00:28.119> inside<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.510> tent

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
deck and we're gonna go inside the tent

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:57.299 
deck and we're gonna go inside the tent
and<00:00:30.369> take<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.119> look<00:00:31.390> at<00:00:31.630> it<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.649> appears<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.280> me

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
and take a look at it it appears to me

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.410 
and take a look at it it appears to me
that<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.609> air<00:00:57.940> turbulence<00:00:58.299> going<00:00:58.659> in<00:00:59.260> is

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that the air turbulence going in is

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.660 
that the air turbulence going in is
combined<00:01:01.420> with<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.719> baffle<00:01:02.139> is<00:01:03.010> what<00:01:03.399> causes

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
combined with the baffle is what causes

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.200 
combined with the baffle is what causes
everything<00:01:04.299> to<00:01:04.509> burn<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.710> have<00:01:06.399> this<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
everything to burn I have this this

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.840 
everything to burn I have this this
field<00:01:10.869> right<00:01:11.289> here<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.159> shield<00:01:12.490> is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
field right here and that shield is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.520 
field right here and that shield is
split<00:01:13.299> up<00:01:13.329> in<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.469> middle<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:17.409> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
split up in the middle so from the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.130 
split up in the middle so from the
outside<00:01:17.979> there<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.490> top<00:01:18.759> vent<00:01:19.140> actually

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
outside there that top vent actually

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.560 
outside there that top vent actually
gets<00:01:20.350> deflected<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.219> goes<00:01:21.609> up<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
gets deflected and goes up for the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.730 
gets deflected and goes up for the
secondary<00:01:22.990> burn<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:24.070> bottom<00:01:24.250> vent<00:01:25.439> feeds<00:01:26.439> in

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
secondary burn the bottom vent feeds in

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.120 
secondary burn the bottom vent feeds in
the<00:01:27.640> poles<00:01:27.909> from<00:01:28.329> underneath<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:29.109> lot<00:01:30.009> of

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
the poles from underneath a lot of

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
the poles from underneath a lot of
turbulence<00:01:30.609> I<00:01:30.729> can<00:01:30.909> hear<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.270> thing<00:01:31.479> just

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
turbulence I can hear this thing just

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.060 
turbulence I can hear this thing just
roaring<00:01:32.399> when<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.429> have<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.880> open<00:01:34.710> all<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.950> way

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
roaring when I have it open all the way

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.599 
roaring when I have it open all the way
up<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.850> like<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.509> fact<00:01:40.780> that<00:01:41.609> there's

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
up and I like the fact that there's

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.370 
up and I like the fact that there's
absolutely<00:01:42.820> no<00:01:43.390> smoke<00:01:43.689> coming<00:01:43.719> out<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.289> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
absolutely no smoke coming out of the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.840 
absolutely no smoke coming out of the
stack<00:01:44.649> meaning<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.249> you're<00:01:45.490> burning

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
stack meaning that you're burning

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.830 
stack meaning that you're burning
everything<00:01:46.119> coming<00:01:47.049> out<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.289> this<00:01:47.409> wood<00:01:47.679> stove

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
everything coming out of this wood stove

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.919 
everything coming out of this wood stove
there's<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.899> lot<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.200> heat<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.770> lot<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.070> bending

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.599 

can<00:01:54.929> see<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> side<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.189> bit

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
can see it here on the side a little bit

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.749 
can see it here on the side a little bit
a<00:01:57.600> couple<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.710> times<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.039> I<00:01:59.100> fired<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
a couple of times that I fired it up

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
a couple of times that I fired it up
that<00:02:00.000> slide<00:02:00.210> practically<00:02:01.079> got<00:02:01.229> red-hot<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that slide practically got red-hot I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.840 
that slide practically got red-hot I
don't<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.509> fail<00:02:03.929> on<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
don't think it's gonna fail on me but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.449 
don't think it's gonna fail on me but
you<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.179> to<00:02:06.359> be<00:02:06.479> careful<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.929> don't<00:02:07.140> like

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
you know just to be careful I don't like

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.979 
you know just to be careful I don't like
red-hot<00:02:08.459> metal<00:02:09.649> close<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.009> I'm<00:02:11.099> at

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
red-hot metal close to where I'm at

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.770 
red-hot metal close to where I'm at
anyway<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:16.640> put<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.879> legs<00:02:18.540> on

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
anyway this is it and put on the legs on

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:31.250 
anyway this is it and put on the legs on
it<00:02:24.230> from<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> sides<00:02:28.940> go<00:02:29.940> outside<00:02:30.360> again<00:02:30.540> good

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
it from the sides go outside again good

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.890 
it from the sides go outside again good
the<00:02:31.349> smoke<00:02:34.430> there<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:36.769> thank<00:02:37.769> you
