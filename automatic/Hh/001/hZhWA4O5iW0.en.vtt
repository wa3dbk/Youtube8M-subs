 our installed applications 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.720
 we will need an explorer 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.100
 it's called root explorer that's going to be 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.650

 another thing that we also have to have 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.050
 in account is to have permits 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.059
 superuser root and still not me route 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.559

 but safer than you that place of 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.420
 fair the pain here is the application 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.610

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.259
 packages and here it tells me that if I want it 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.080

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.159
 at the beginning he asks us for permission 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.039
