00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
studio to break the ice I guess they

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.760 
studio to break the ice I guess they
used<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:07.810> shoot<00:06:08.810> rubber<00:06:09.139> bands<00:06:09.440> off<00:06:09.740> the

used to shoot rubber bands off the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.769 
used to shoot rubber bands off the
ceiling<00:06:10.460> so<00:06:10.729> it<00:06:10.789> would<00:06:10.909> drop<00:06:11.090> right<00:06:11.330> onto<00:06:11.539> your

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:11.779 
ceiling so it would drop right onto your

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.550 
ceiling so it would drop right onto your
head<00:06:12.460> always<00:06:13.460> teasing<00:06:14.150> each<00:06:14.270> other<00:06:14.509> they<00:06:15.229> even

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
head always teasing each other they even

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.640 
head always teasing each other they even
had<00:06:15.740> a<00:06:15.770> bucket<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.279> water<00:06:16.460> up<00:06:16.940> on<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.419> door<00:06:18.050> and

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
had a bucket of water up on the door and

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.100 
had a bucket of water up on the door and
whenever<00:06:19.129> anyone<00:06:19.759> would<00:06:20.240> come<00:06:20.479> through<00:06:20.870> that

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
whenever anyone would come through that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.820 
whenever anyone would come through that
door

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
door

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.119 
door
they'd<00:06:22.490> get<00:06:22.669> their<00:06:22.849> bucket<00:06:23.240> away<00:06:23.360> and<00:06:24.199> they'd

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
they'd get their bucket away and they'd

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:32.010 
they'd get their bucket away and they'd
laugh<00:06:25.490> and

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:40.809 

so<00:06:33.020> it<00:06:33.110> wasn't<00:06:33.409> all<00:06:33.529> work<00:06:39.099> that<00:06:40.099> was<00:06:40.339> a<00:06:40.370> time

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:40.819 
so it wasn't all work that was a time

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.549 
so it wasn't all work that was a time
