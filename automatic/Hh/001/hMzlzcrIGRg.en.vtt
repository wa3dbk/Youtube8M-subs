00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.940
 is tested whether the ward nurse and the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.920
 criteria for demand-driven care 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.600

 work at 4 healthcare institutions 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.320
 west brabant 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.250
 the regional cross association requires 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.980
 also from its stakeholders such as vws 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 education general practitioners municipality 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.620

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 to work based on customer demand 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.400
 the cross club has a lot 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 generate publicity 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.480

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.480
 approach in experiences 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.330
 yes, because this ward sister who worked on 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.340
 all rules through all financing 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.190
 structures that we thought they 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 just does what is needed and we come 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.820
 so soon with the notes to the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 room in which would also appear very clear 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.520
 that this is the side we are on 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 The Netherlands must go to care in the neighborhood 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.830
 delivered by someone who looks that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.100
 someone needed and not what arrangement needs 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.660
 I now meet again and 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.770
 from which path you now get it again 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.820
 funded by research from bmc and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
 the pom 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.530
 it turned out that this approach was cheaper and 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.980
 is of better quality and that the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.090
 social cohesion in the neighborhood has increased 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.590

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.610
 developments in care in the neighborhood 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 encouraged 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.580

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.630
 in healthcare 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.870
 we have to get rid of thinking in products 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.160
 and focus more on information 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.120

 example model 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.400
 we want care in the neighborhood in which the 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.980
 neighborhood nurse plays an important role 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.230
 where it concerns care and housing
