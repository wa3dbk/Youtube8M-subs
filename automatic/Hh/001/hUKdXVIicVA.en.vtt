like<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> lot<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> coconut<00:00:46.590> oil<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> great

like it a lot and coconut oil is great

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
like it a lot and coconut oil is great

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because it penetrates the hair reduces

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
because it penetrates the hair reduces
damage<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> breakage<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.090> does<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> by

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
damage and breakage and it does that by

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
damage and breakage and it does that by
protecting<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.289> hair<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:52.620> hydro<00:00:52.949> fatigue
