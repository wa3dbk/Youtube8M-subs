up thinks I'll you have user menu it has

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.760 
up thinks I'll you have user menu it has
a<00:00:38.910> very<00:00:39.420> different<00:00:39.690> language<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
a very different language so there's a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830 
a very different language so there's a
few<00:00:40.920> page<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.309> each<00:00:41.399> language<00:00:41.840> English

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
few page for each language English

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
few page for each language English
basically<00:00:43.260> tell<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.920> features<00:00:44.129> lovely

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
basically tell you some features lovely

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
basically tell you some features lovely
the<00:00:45.559> specification<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> set<00:00:47.489> up

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the specification so you have to set up

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
the specification so you have to set up
BIOS<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> install<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> device<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
BIOS and have to install the device and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
BIOS and have to install the device and
then<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> SSD<00:00:50.640> itself<00:00:56.000> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
then you have the SSD itself is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.599 
then you have the SSD itself is
basically<00:00:57.770> look<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.800> brushed<00:00:59.190> aluminum

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
basically look like brushed aluminum

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.439 
basically look like brushed aluminum
very<00:01:00.149> light<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.350> very<00:01:01.410> small<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:03.359> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
very light and very small here and then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
very light and very small here and then
you<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.260> four<00:01:04.619> screw<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> install

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you have just be four screw to install

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.390 
you have just be four screw to install
this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.360> aluminum<00:01:06.659> casing<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:08.159> does

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is an aluminum casing it does

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
this is an aluminum casing it does
attract<00:01:08.760> finger<00:01:09.000> prints<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.960> guess<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
attract finger prints but I guess it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
attract finger prints but I guess it
shouldn't<00:01:10.710> matter<00:01:10.830> too<00:01:11.070> much<00:01:11.100> wanna<00:01:11.520> goes<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
shouldn't matter too much wanna goes and

I then plug this into my computer and I
was<00:01:57.659> able<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> get<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:59.009> faster<00:01:59.369> speed<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.850> was

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
was able to get much faster speed it was

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
was able to get much faster speed it was
in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> SATA<00:02:00.750> 3<00:02:00.869> port<00:02:01.290> 6<00:02:01.829> gigabit<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.939> was
