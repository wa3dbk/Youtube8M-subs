00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.260 
cheat well basically you put in what you
want<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> enchant

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
want to enchant

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.260 
want to enchant
so<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:13.660> gonna<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:15.580> put<00:02:15.850> four<00:02:16.120> items

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
so I'm gonna have that we put four items

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.220 
so I'm gonna have that we put four items
at<00:02:16.480> once<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.810> give<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.050> all<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> same

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
at once and give them all the same

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.250 
at once and give them all the same
enchantments<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.900> we're<00:02:19.960> going<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> have

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
enchantments but so we're going to have

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.080 
enchantments but so we're going to have
protection<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.460> can<00:02:21.580> set<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:21.910> level

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
protection and you can set what level

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
protection and you can set what level
you<00:02:22.180> want<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> enchantment<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.930> usually<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
you want the enchantment to usually the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.570 
you want the enchantment to usually the
highest<00:02:23.770> level<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.100> get<00:02:24.220> an<00:02:24.280> enchantment

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
highest level you can get an enchantment

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.100 
highest level you can get an enchantment
to<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.030> four<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.390> five<00:02:25.450> some<00:02:25.840> around

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
to is like four or five some around

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.590 
to is like four or five some around
there<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:26.920> have<00:02:27.130> level<00:02:27.370> 127<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.510> can

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
there so we have level 127 you can

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.370 
there so we have level 127 you can
change<00:02:28.690> whatever<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.080> want<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:30.060> 200<00:02:31.060> nor<00:02:31.240> I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.140 

guess<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> maximum<00:02:35.830> is<00:02:35.860> 127<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.850> some<00:02:36.940> reason

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
guess the maximum is 127 for some reason

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.930 
guess the maximum is 127 for some reason
of<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.020> random<00:02:38.380> number<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:39.490> we're<00:02:39.610> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> do

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
of a random number but we're going to do

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.480 
of a random number but we're going to do
that<00:02:40.060> set<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.870> then<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.830> they're<00:02:42.100> only<00:02:42.250> chat

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
that set and then so they're only chat

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.840 
that set and then so they're only chat
with<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.490> enchant<00:02:45.610> them

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
with that and then you can enchant them

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:56.040 
with that and then you can enchant them
with<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:51.450> once<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.570> got<00:02:55.050> that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
with that that that once we got that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.350 
with that that that once we got that
done<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.650> does<00:02:56.830> with<00:02:57.010> sounds<00:02:57.220> cool<00:02:57.370> fire

Ravina rafinha ravine but I'm going to

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.520 
Ravina rafinha ravine but I'm going to
go<00:04:57.740> ahead<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.010> we're<00:04:58.640> going<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.820> get<00:04:59.530> some

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
go ahead and we're going to get some

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.690 
go ahead and we're going to get some
ores<00:05:00.880> diamond<00:05:01.880> or<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:04.310> I'm<00:05:04.370> going<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> face

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
ores diamond or so I'm going to face

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.120 
ores diamond or so I'm going to face
that<00:05:04.850> down<00:05:05.530> see<00:05:06.530> how<00:05:06.590> many<00:05:06.740> would<00:05:06.830> get<00:05:07.010> from

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
that down see how many would get from

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.390 
that down see how many would get from
one<00:05:07.280> block<00:05:07.430> of<00:05:07.520> diamond<00:05:07.820> door<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:10.010> how<00:05:10.310> many

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
one block of diamond door so how many

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.160 
one block of diamond door so how many
this<00:05:10.640> is<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.500> but<00:05:13.370> roughly<00:05:13.940> two<00:05:14.120> are<00:05:14.450> one<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
this is so but roughly two are one and a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.270 
this is so but roughly two are one and a
half<00:05:15.200> full<00:05:15.980> stacks<00:05:16.310> diamond<00:05:17.920> just<00:05:18.920> over<00:05:19.100> I

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
half full stacks diamond just over I

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:27.700 
half full stacks diamond just over I
think<00:05:19.780> Cole<00:05:25.840> probably<00:05:26.840> get<00:05:26.960> about<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.170> sin<00:05:27.440> no

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
think Cole probably get about the sin no

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.290 
think Cole probably get about the sin no
but<00:05:28.310> half<00:05:28.490> stack<00:05:32.020> masses<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.080> redstone<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:35.120> read

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
but half stack masses a redstone to read

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.090 
but half stack masses a redstone to read
signals<00:05:35.630> for<00:05:35.780> some<00:05:35.870> reason<00:05:36.080> let's<00:05:36.200> get<00:05:36.320> weird

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.480 

but<00:05:40.100> yep<00:05:40.480> well<00:05:41.480> quite<00:05:41.900> a<00:05:41.960> lot<00:05:42.200> that<00:05:42.380> just<00:05:42.800> just

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
but yep well quite a lot that just just

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.340 
but yep well quite a lot that just just
over<00:05:43.790> two<00:05:43.940> stacks<00:05:44.270> just<00:05:44.510> want<00:05:44.690> two<00:05:45.020> extra

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
over two stacks just want two extra

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.170 
over two stacks just want two extra
things<00:05:45.560> on<00:05:45.770> our<00:05:45.800> yeah<00:05:48.100> but<00:05:49.100> yeah<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.120> a

yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I
think<00:06:42.360> this<00:06:42.780> would<00:06:42.990> work<00:06:43.140> on<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.440> multiplayer

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
think this would work on a multiplayer

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.110 
think this would work on a multiplayer
server<00:06:45.350> as<00:06:46.350> long<00:06:46.470> as<00:06:46.560> dropped<00:06:46.830> but<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.850> haven't

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
server as long as dropped but I haven't

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.810 
server as long as dropped but I haven't
tried<00:06:48.210> that<00:06:48.360> myself<00:06:48.600> but<00:06:48.990> it<00:06:49.200> should<00:06:49.440> do<00:06:49.680> if<00:06:50.190> if

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
tried that myself but it should do if if

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.900 
tried that myself but it should do if if
I'm<00:06:51.270> thinking<00:06:51.750> right<00:06:52.250> yes<00:06:53.250> it's<00:06:53.700> an<00:06:53.790> awesome

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910
