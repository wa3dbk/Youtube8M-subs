00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.790 
test now so I decided just get away and
not<00:04:40.419> get<00:04:40.660> killed<00:04:40.900> since<00:04:41.470> he<00:04:41.620> had<00:04:41.770> already

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
not get killed since he had already

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.670 
not get killed since he had already

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
profile so I'm starting to think

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.550 
profile so I'm starting to think
actually<00:04:45.100> being<00:04:45.610> profiled<00:04:46.150> by<00:04:47.110> someone

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
actually being profiled by someone

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.010 
actually being profiled by someone
you're<00:04:47.770> reserving<00:04:48.070> brains<00:04:48.880> on<00:04:49.120> telling<00:04:49.750> like

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
you're reserving brains on telling like

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.130 
you're reserving brains on telling like
for<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:50.980> after<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:51.940> got<00:04:52.210> profiled<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:52.960> got

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
for you so after I got profiled and got

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.940 
for you so after I got profiled and got
away<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.440> decided<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:54.450> order<00:04:55.450> me<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.930> car<00:04:56.290> as<00:04:56.530> you

lives<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:00.790> moving<00:05:01.240> see<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:02.229> background<00:05:02.770> is

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
lives in moving see the background is

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.610

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:20.620 
background was frozen it's still frozen
right<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:11.560> here's<00:05:11.830> my<00:05:12.100> look

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630
