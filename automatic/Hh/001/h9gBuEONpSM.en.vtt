00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.170 
recipes but despite getting the loot
crate<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.649> basically<00:00:27.130> when<00:00:27.369> you<00:00:27.399> spawn<00:00:27.669> you'll

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
crate so basically when you spawn you'll

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.620 
crate so basically when you spawn you'll
see<00:00:28.419> luke<00:00:28.630> rates<00:00:28.899> around<00:00:29.020> you<00:00:29.259> which<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:29.619> then

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
see luke rates around you which you then

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.280 
see luke rates around you which you then
get<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.750> loot<00:00:31.899> crate's

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
get the loot crate's

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.150 
get the loot crate's
so<00:00:33.219> for<00:00:33.520> example<00:00:33.940> if<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.450> this<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.410> like<00:00:35.590> this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
so for example if you this is like this

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.270 
so for example if you this is like this
I'm<00:00:36.489> just<00:00:36.700> finding<00:00:36.910> myself<00:00:37.410> spawns<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:39.100> by

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
I'm just finding myself spawns just by

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
I'm just finding myself spawns just by
itself<00:00:39.580> like<00:00:39.700> on<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:41.190> making<00:00:42.190> your<00:00:42.370> world<00:00:42.490> but

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
itself like on you making your world but

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.960 
itself like on you making your world but

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
to get the item all you do is a break it

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.540 
to get the item all you do is a break it
and<00:00:46.210> then<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.750> spawns<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.320> random<00:00:47.710> item<00:00:47.950> in<00:00:48.400> it

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
and then it spawns a random item in it

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.319 
and then it spawns a random item in it

because<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> shooting<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.030> need<00:02:13.150> to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
because of the shooting you just need to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.260 
because of the shooting you just need to
reload<00:02:13.540> them<00:02:13.720> by<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.230> getting<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.340> magazine

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
reload them by just getting the magazine

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.760 
reload them by just getting the magazine
and<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.870> get<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.140> from<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.320> airsoft

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
and you get it from the airsoft

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.050 
and you get it from the airsoft
lootcrate<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:18.790> everything

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
lootcrate just like you get everything

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.229 
lootcrate just like you get everything
else<00:02:20.040> hopefully<00:02:21.040> it'll<00:02:21.400> be<00:02:21.550> full<00:02:21.820> if<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.060> get

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
else hopefully it'll be full if you get

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.880 
else hopefully it'll be full if you get
it<00:02:22.360> ah<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:25.630> reload<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.260> just<00:02:26.470> right-click

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
it ah to to reload it just right-click

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.800 
it ah to to reload it just right-click
it<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.360> there<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.390> go

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it and there you go

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.580 
it and there you go
we<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.680> scar<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:31.239> goes<00:02:31.390> back<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
we have this scar and it goes back and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.770 
we have this scar and it goes back and
then<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.830> turns<00:02:33.130> into<00:02:33.220> empty<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> magazine

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
then it turns into empty of the magazine

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780 
then it turns into empty of the magazine
so<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.200> doesn't<00:02:35.470> break<00:02:35.980> or<00:02:36.220> anything<00:02:36.430> or<00:02:36.730> it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so it doesn't break or anything or it

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.030 
so it doesn't break or anything or it
doesn't<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.630> used<00:02:37.750> up<00:02:37.989> so<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.800> fill

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
doesn't get used up so you can just fill

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.660 
doesn't get used up so you can just fill
these<00:02:39.130> up<00:02:39.780> by<00:02:40.780> using<00:02:40.989> two<00:02:41.440> bags<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:42.040> airsoft

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

tube a of airsoft BB's that's for the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.210 
tube a of airsoft BB's that's for the
AUG<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.410> rest<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> guns<00:02:50.950> in

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
AUG but for the rest of the guns in

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.920 
AUG but for the rest of the guns in
order<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.730> fill<00:02:52.000> them<00:02:52.120> up<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.480> take<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
order to fill them up just take the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.600 
order to fill them up just take the
empty<00:02:53.380> cartridges<00:02:53.739> put<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.430> then

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
empty cartridges put in there and then

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.220 
empty cartridges put in there and then
just<00:02:54.820> use<00:02:54.970> one<00:02:55.269> Vega<00:02:55.540> verse<00:02:55.720> off<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.200> for

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
just use one Vega verse off but for

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.640 
just use one Vega verse off but for
these<00:02:56.470> two<00:02:56.650> guns<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.340> two<00:02:57.549> bags<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.650> same

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
these two guns it's two bags and same

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.970 
these two guns it's two bags and same
for<00:02:59.860> this<00:02:59.980> one<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.430> does<00:03:00.810> 48<00:03:02.160> uses<00:03:03.160> 48<00:03:03.700> babies

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
for this one it does 48 uses 48 babies

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.380 
for this one it does 48 uses 48 babies
and<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.280> believe<00:03:06.519> it's<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.940> same<00:03:07.150> type<00:03:07.360> of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
and I believe it's like the same type of

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.020 
and I believe it's like the same type of
damage<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.459> guide<00:03:09.610> never<00:03:09.850> really

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
damage but it the guide never really

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.150 
damage but it the guide never really
explained<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.630> all<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.410> damage<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.890> stuff

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
explained it all the damage and stuff

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.810 
explained it all the damage and stuff
but<00:03:12.400> these<00:03:12.880> these<00:03:13.630> guns<00:03:13.840> are<00:03:13.989> quite<00:03:14.530> powerful

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
but these these guns are quite powerful

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.520 
but these these guns are quite powerful
now<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.880> next<00:03:16.209> one<00:03:16.390> is<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.570> sniper<00:03:16.840> rifle<00:03:17.380> but

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
now the next one is a sniper rifle but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.289 
now the next one is a sniper rifle but
there<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.549> no<00:03:18.760> scope<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.799> texture

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
there is no scope on it in the texture

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.400 
there is no scope on it in the texture
it<00:03:22.299> also<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.600> kind<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.840> cool<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it also be kind of cool like if you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.880 
it also be kind of cool like if you
can't<00:03:23.560> aim<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:26.410> must<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:26.709> pretty

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
can't aim on it but that must be pretty

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.850 
can't aim on it but that must be pretty
hard<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.190> do<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.430> think

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
hard to do I think

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.160 
hard to do I think
why<00:03:29.640> did<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.850> do<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.030> again<00:03:30.330> darkness<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:31.020> wine

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
why did I do that again darkness my wine

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.410 
why did I do that again darkness my wine
but<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.440> has<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> pretty<00:03:32.610> long<00:03:32.730> range

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
but this has a pretty long range

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.400 
but this has a pretty long range
compared<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.080> other<00:03:35.000> guns<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:37.260> make

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
compared to the other guns so just make

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.250 
compared to the other guns so just make
sure<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:38.490> falls<00:03:38.820> like<00:03:39.150> at<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.020> block

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
sure that it falls like at that block

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.070 
sure that it falls like at that block
right<00:03:40.290> there<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.040> then<00:03:41.750> I'm<00:03:42.750> gonna<00:03:42.870> right

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
right there and then I'm gonna right

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.350 
right there and then I'm gonna right
click<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.470> goes<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.770> way<00:03:43.980> over<00:03:44.370> there<00:03:44.520> and<00:03:44.820> it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
click it goes like way over there and it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.710 
click it goes like way over there and it
does<00:03:45.480> pretty<00:03:45.660> good<00:03:45.750> damage<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.540> just

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720

does pretty good damage you can just
hold<00:03:48.960> right<00:03:49.200> click<00:03:49.310> for<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.520> keep<00:03:50.880> shooting

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
so when you right-click boo just sound

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.450 
so when you right-click boo just sound
effect<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:25.890> like<00:05:26.010> that

effect just like that

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.270 
effect just like that
and<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:27.600> coolest<00:05:27.840> part<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.470> think<00:05:28.590> is<00:05:28.919> a<00:05:28.950> smoke

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
and the coolest part I think is a smoke

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.600 
and the coolest part I think is a smoke
grenade<00:05:29.310> that's<00:05:29.970> when<00:05:30.090> your<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.330> cook<00:05:31.610> makes

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
grenade that's when your I cook makes

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.150 
grenade that's when your I cook makes
some<00:05:32.820> really<00:05:32.850> cool<00:05:33.419> smoke<00:05:33.870> like<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.160> sound

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
some really cool smoke like that sound

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.050 
some really cool smoke like that sound
effect<00:05:35.280> like<00:05:35.580> that

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
effect like that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.860 
effect like that
Oh<00:05:36.530> waters

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.760 

then<00:05:41.200> just<00:05:41.500> stays<00:05:41.740> there<00:05:41.950> for<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.610> while<00:05:43.770> and

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
then just stays there for a while and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.670 
then just stays there for a while and
when<00:05:44.890> you<00:05:44.950> go<00:05:45.100> inside<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.400> gets<00:05:45.700> kind<00:05:45.910> of<00:05:45.970> laggy

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
when you go inside it gets kind of laggy

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.500 
when you go inside it gets kind of laggy
which<00:05:47.680> would<00:05:47.890> kind<00:05:48.160> of<00:05:48.280> make<00:05:48.430> sense<00:05:48.670> cuz<00:05:49.000> just

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
which would kind of make sense cuz just

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.510 
which would kind of make sense cuz just
it's<00:05:50.200> a<00:05:50.260> ton<00:05:50.470> of<00:05:50.500> particle<00:05:51.010> effects<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.400> know

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
it's a ton of particle effects you know

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.590 
it's a ton of particle effects you know
it's<00:05:52.150> pretty<00:05:52.330> cool<00:05:54.030> so<00:05:55.030> if<00:05:55.090> he<00:05:55.150> doesn't<00:05:55.330> do<00:05:55.570> it

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
it's pretty cool so if he doesn't do it

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.900 
it's pretty cool so if he doesn't do it
