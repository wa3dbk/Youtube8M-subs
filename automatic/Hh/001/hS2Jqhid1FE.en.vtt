around ending at a point to create
teardrop<00:02:17.520> shapes<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:19.250> decided<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.489> use<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
teardrop shapes I decided to use a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.850 
teardrop shapes I decided to use a
really<00:02:20.970> dark<00:02:21.360> blue<00:02:21.660> instead<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> black<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
really dark blue instead of black to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.110 
really dark blue instead of black to
outline<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.930> I'm<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.680> pressing<00:02:26.340> down<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.790> my

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
outline and I'm just pressing down on my

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.780 
outline and I'm just pressing down on my
brush<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> base<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.980> teardrop<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
brush at the base of the teardrop so you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.330 
brush at the base of the teardrop so you
want<00:02:30.030> thin<00:02:30.930> lines<00:02:31.260> at<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> top<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> nice

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
want thin lines at the top and a nice

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.520 
want thin lines at the top and a nice
thick<00:02:32.820> line<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> bottom<00:02:34.230> where<00:02:34.410> they

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
thick line at the bottom where they

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.660 
thick line at the bottom where they
curve

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.390 

now<00:02:39.090> add<00:02:39.300> swirls<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.500> lines<00:02:40.890> from<00:02:41.190> those

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
now add swirls and lines from those

teardrops all the way up to the base of
the<00:02:43.800> peacock<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.800> add<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.700> point<00:02:48.090> on

the peacock and add a little point on

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.600 
the peacock and add a little point on

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the end if you want this isn't necessary

the end if you want this isn't necessary
I<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.970> thought<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> looked<00:02:51.240> nice<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.699 

continued<00:02:56.070> adding<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.820> swirls<00:02:57.709> anywhere

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
continued adding in swirls anywhere

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.020 
continued adding in swirls anywhere
where<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.880> look

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
where you think that they would look

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.260 
where you think that they would look
attractive<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.170> fill<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.530> space<00:03:02.030> make<00:03:03.030> sure

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
attractive or to fill in space make sure

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.470 
attractive or to fill in space make sure
that<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.630> swirl<00:03:04.170> downwards<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.480> flow

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
that they swirl downwards and flow

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.820 
that they swirl downwards and flow
nicely<00:03:08.750> make<00:03:09.750> sure<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:10.380> least<00:03:10.410> one

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
nicely make sure to do at least one

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
swirl under the eye to help frame the

eye and round off the design add a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.030 
eye and round off the design add a
little<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.640> white<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.450> eye<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
little bit of white for the eye and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.560 
little bit of white for the eye and
we're<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.190> let<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.489> dry<00:03:20.700> now<00:03:21.269> and

we're going to let that dry now and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.160 
we're going to let that dry now and
start<00:03:22.380> outlining<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.100> peacock<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.959> want<00:03:25.080> to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
start outlining the peacock you want to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.949 
start outlining the peacock you want to
have<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> nice<00:03:25.530> swirling<00:03:26.430> S<00:03:26.760> shape<00:03:27.420> for<00:03:27.870> the

have a nice swirling S shape for the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.970 
have a nice swirling S shape for the
body<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:29.810> try<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.840> keep<00:03:31.230> your<00:03:31.530> lines

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
body and try to keep your lines

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.710 
body and try to keep your lines
relatively<00:03:32.880> thin<00:03:33.239> around<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.900> head<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:36.510> way

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
relatively thin around the head that way

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720 
relatively thin around the head that way
it<00:03:36.840> won't<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:37.140> too<00:03:37.410> overwhelmed<00:03:38.040> by<00:03:38.220> line<00:03:38.459> work

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
it won't be too overwhelmed by line work

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.130 
it won't be too overwhelmed by line work
and<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> plumes<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.850> think<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:45.959> what

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
and for the plumes I think that's what

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.020 
and for the plumes I think that's what
it's<00:03:46.290> called<00:03:46.380> coming<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.160> from<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.489> head<00:03:47.760> of

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's called coming out from the head of

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.410 
it's called coming out from the head of
the<00:03:48.269> bird<00:03:48.799> start<00:03:49.799> thick<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.370> then<00:03:50.640> end<00:03:50.880> very

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
the bird start thick and then end very

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.110 
the bird start thick and then end very
thin<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.320> we'll<00:03:52.950> add<00:03:53.130> some<00:03:53.160> teardrops<00:03:53.850> to

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
thin and we'll add some teardrops to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.460 
thin and we'll add some teardrops to
this<00:03:54.420> later<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.910> decided<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.840> three

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
this later I just decided to do three

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.110 
this later I just decided to do three
little<00:03:58.709> feathers<00:03:59.160> coming<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.700> from<00:03:59.910> there

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
little feathers coming out from there

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.789 
little feathers coming out from there
connect<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.239> eye<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.690> beak<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.320> try<00:04:04.739> to

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
connect the eye to the beak and try to

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.509 
connect the eye to the beak and try to
make<00:04:04.980> these<00:04:05.220> lines<00:04:05.610> nice<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.360> thin<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.690> well

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
make these lines nice and thin as well

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.830 
make these lines nice and thin as well
of<00:04:08.519> course<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.930> add<00:04:10.079> eyelashes<00:04:10.920> and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
of course you have to add eyelashes and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.190 
of course you have to add eyelashes and
a<00:04:12.840> simple<00:04:13.410> circle<00:04:13.890> at<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.840> closer<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
a simple circle at the closer to the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.710 
a simple circle at the closer to the
front<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.829> eye<00:04:16.859> finishes<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.910> off<00:04:18.000> I

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.000 

wanted<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.780> add<00:04:21.989> even<00:04:22.200> more<00:04:22.380> color<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.919> I'm

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
wanted to add even more color so I'm

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.130 
wanted to add even more color so I'm
taking<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.460> creamy<00:04:23.760> magenta<00:04:24.419> from<00:04:24.630> Crillon

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
taking the creamy magenta from Crillon

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.480 
taking the creamy magenta from Crillon
and<00:04:25.350> I'm<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.280> paint<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.300> quick<00:04:27.720> loop

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
and I'm going to paint a quick loop

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.090 
and I'm going to paint a quick loop
inside<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.640> my<00:04:29.789> feathers<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.740> helps

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
inside of my feathers and this helps

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.310 
inside of my feathers and this helps
give<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.430> cool<00:04:32.610> design<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:34.050> helps

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
give it a cool design and it helps

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.040 
give it a cool design and it helps
brighten<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.860> up<00:04:35.010> by<00:04:35.880> adding<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.570> pop<00:04:36.870> of

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
brighten it up by adding that pop of

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.070 
brighten it up by adding that pop of
color

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
color

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.249 
color
now<00:04:38.590> also<00:04:38.970> accentuated<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.150> body<00:04:40.389> with<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
now also accentuated the body with the

teardrops<00:05:21.529> around<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.580> very<00:05:22.939> bottom<00:05:23.509> swirl

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
teardrops around the very bottom swirl

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.409 
teardrops around the very bottom swirl
and<00:05:24.349> that<00:05:24.770> just<00:05:24.979> helps<00:05:25.249> design<00:05:25.699> look<00:05:25.939> complete

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419
