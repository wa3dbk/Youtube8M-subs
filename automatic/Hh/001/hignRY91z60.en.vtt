00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
little squiggle on the top or it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600 
little squiggle on the top or it's
actually<00:01:30.479> written<00:01:30.900> out<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:32.100> sixteenth

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
notes and an eighth note so the most

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.389 
notes and an eighth note so the most
obvious<00:01:36.180> place<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:37.049> put<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.740> trouble<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
obvious place to put in a trouble in

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:47.870 
obvious place to put in a trouble in
that<00:01:38.579> tune<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> first<00:01:40.110> measure

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.510 

and<00:01:48.880> there<00:01:49.690> are<00:01:49.810> two<00:01:50.050> ways<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:50.800> approaching<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
and there are two ways of approaching a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
and there are two ways of approaching a
trouble<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.570> can<00:01:52.750> make<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.260> dainty<00:01:53.860> treble

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.740 

or<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.790> can<00:02:00.970> give<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.240> little<00:02:01.390> bit<00:02:01.600> more

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
or you can give it a little bit more

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.110 
or you can give it a little bit more
grit<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.490> only<00:02:06.640> difference<00:02:06.850> between

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
grit so the only difference between

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.320 
grit so the only difference between
those<00:02:07.510> two<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:08.230> with<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.430> grittier<00:02:09.820> trouble

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
those two is with the grittier trouble

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.900 
those two is with the grittier trouble
I'm<00:02:11.220> putting<00:02:12.220> a<00:02:12.280> little<00:02:12.460> bit<00:02:12.580> more<00:02:12.700> pressure

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
I'm putting a little bit more pressure

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880 
I'm putting a little bit more pressure
on<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.330> bow<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:13.780> focuses<00:02:14.350> here<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
on the bow which focuses here on the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.060 
on the bow which focuses here on the
front<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.220> my<00:02:15.250> hand<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.570> then<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.440> limit<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
front of my hand and then I limit the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.040 
front of my hand and then I limit the
distance<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> bow<00:02:19.090> travels<00:02:19.630> during<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
distance that the bow travels during the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.960 
distance that the bow travels during the
notes<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> bow<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.980> only<00:02:24.160> traveling<00:02:24.760> about

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
notes so the bow is only traveling about

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.120 
notes so the bow is only traveling about
half<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.720> center<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.770> dainty

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
half of the center and in the dainty

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.950 
half of the center and in the dainty
version<00:02:34.200> um<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> first<00:02:36.910> way<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
version um so that is the first way to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.110 
version um so that is the first way to
use<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> treble<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.520> use<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.910> dress

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
use a treble so you can use it to dress

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420 
use a treble so you can use it to dress
up<00:02:40.330> any<00:02:40.570> time<00:02:40.870> you're<00:02:41.140> playing<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.800> quarter

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
up any time you're playing a quarter

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.580 
up any time you're playing a quarter
note<00:02:42.580> that's<00:02:42.820> on<00:02:42.970> an<00:02:43.090> open<00:02:43.480> note<00:02:43.630> open<00:02:44.110> strings

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
note that's on an open note open strings

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.100 
note that's on an open note open strings
are<00:02:44.740> harder<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.220> put<00:02:45.640> an<00:02:45.730> ornament<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:46.570> you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
are harder to put an ornament on so you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.160 
are harder to put an ornament on so you
can<00:02:47.230> put<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> treble<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.800> there<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.630> next<00:02:49.960> thing

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
can put a treble on there the next thing

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.650 
can put a treble on there the next thing
is<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.740> hide<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:51.760> troubles<00:02:52.270> in<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
is I like to hide my troubles in the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.760 
is I like to hide my troubles in the
rest<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.110> tune<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.709> some<00:02:54.330> surprising<00:02:55.330> ways

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
rest of the tune in some surprising ways

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.070 
rest of the tune in some surprising ways
so<00:02:56.770> what<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.520> do<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.240> take<00:02:58.420> any

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
so what you can do is you can take any

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.600 
so what you can do is you can take any
two<00:02:59.440> eighth<00:02:59.680> notes<00:02:59.709> at<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.190> front<00:03:00.520> of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
two eighth notes at the front of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.000 
two eighth notes at the front of
assistant<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.240> a<00:03:01.420> front<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.900> group<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.800> four

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
assistant of a front of a group of four

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850 
assistant of a front of a group of four
eighth<00:03:03.250> notes<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:04.690> take<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.650> first

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
eighth notes and just take that first

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.570 
eighth notes and just take that first
age<00:03:06.100> note

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.490 
age note
cut<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.209> half<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.540> make<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.840> two<00:03:07.989> sixteenth

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
cut it in half and make it two sixteenth

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.910

notes<00:03:08.739> so<00:03:09.250> although<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.489> will<00:03:09.850> sound<00:03:10.060> like

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
notes so although that will sound like

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.080 
notes so although that will sound like
for<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.430> second<00:03:12.700> measure<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
for it like in the second measure of a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.289

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
that's it sorry the third measure so I'm

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.110 
that's it sorry the third measure so I'm
taking<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.200> first<00:03:31.650> set<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.640> four<00:03:32.849> which

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
taking that that first set of four which

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.699 
taking that that first set of four which
goes<00:03:33.329> like<00:03:33.450> this

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
goes like this

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.679 
goes like this
and<00:03:35.159> I'm<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.519> picking<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.090> first<00:03:36.480> note

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
and I'm just picking that first note

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.830 
and I'm just picking that first note
which<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:36.959> an<00:03:37.109> open<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.439> and<00:03:38.599> breaking<00:03:39.599> it<00:03:39.719> into

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
which is an open a and breaking it into

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.379 
which is an open a and breaking it into
two<00:03:39.959> eighth<00:03:40.230> notes<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.650> mean<00:03:40.889> two<00:03:41.099> 16<00:03:41.430> notes<00:03:44.389> and

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
two eighth notes I mean two 16 notes and

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:57.490 
two eighth notes I mean two 16 notes and
really<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:45.750> could<00:03:45.900> put<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.139> anywhere

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.259 

alright<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.069> notice<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.579> usually<00:03:59.730> start<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
alright so notice you usually start a

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.059 
alright so notice you usually start a
treble<00:04:00.629> starting<00:04:01.079> on<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.230> down<00:04:01.500> bow<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.889> have

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
treble starting on a down bow I have

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.729 
treble starting on a down bow I have
seemed<00:04:02.400> amazing<00:04:02.819> Fiddler's<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.200> treble<00:04:04.500> on

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
seemed amazing Fiddler's do a treble on

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.220 
seemed amazing Fiddler's do a treble on
an<00:04:04.859> up<00:04:05.040> bow<00:04:05.250> but<00:04:06.120> that's<00:04:06.239> not<00:04:06.480> standard<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
an up bow but that's not standard and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.940 
an up bow but that's not standard and
those<00:04:08.159> Fiddler's<00:04:09.030> I've<00:04:09.329> really<00:04:10.109> gifted<00:04:10.530> so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
those Fiddler's I've really gifted so

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.069 
those Fiddler's I've really gifted so
don't<00:04:11.909> feel<00:04:12.060> bad<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:12.419> can't<00:04:12.510> do<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> treble

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
don't feel bad if you can't do a treble

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.939 
don't feel bad if you can't do a treble
starting<00:04:13.680> on<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.859> though<00:04:14.250> um<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:16.709> other<00:04:16.829> thing

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
starting on it though um the other thing

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.520 
starting on it though um the other thing
you<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.370> do<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.729> use<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.359> treble<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.320> place

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
you can do is use a treble in the place

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.850 
you can do is use a treble in the place
of<00:04:19.829> an<00:04:20.459> ornament<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.180> you've<00:04:22.019> got<00:04:22.229> rolls<00:04:22.530> like

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
of an ornament so you've got rolls like

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.790 
of an ornament so you've got rolls like
this<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.110> want<00:04:25.409> to<00:04:25.500> use<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.280> treble<00:04:27.800> but

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
this if you want to use a treble but

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.339 
this if you want to use a treble but
don't<00:04:29.099> want<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.639> boring<00:04:30.030> trouble<00:04:30.360> you

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
don't want to just boring trouble you

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.920 
don't want to just boring trouble you
can<00:04:31.560> take<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.520> middle<00:04:32.760> note<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.570> treble

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
can take the middle note in the treble

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.879 
can take the middle note in the treble
and<00:04:34.280> either<00:04:35.870> go<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.110> next<00:04:37.289> note<00:04:37.440> up<00:04:37.470> or<00:04:37.800> go

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
and either go to the next note up or go

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.159 
and either go to the next note up or go
to<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.190> note<00:04:38.820> below<00:04:39.300> it'll<00:04:39.659> either<00:04:39.840> sound

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
to the note below it'll either sound

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.850 
to the note below it'll either sound
like<00:04:40.289> this<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:44.490> in<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.639> B<00:04:44.789> part<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:46.590> sounds

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
like this so in the B part it sounds

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:59.570 
like this so in the B part it sounds
like<00:04:46.949> this

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.620 

so<00:05:00.580> I'm<00:05:00.640> doing<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.910> treble<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.390> where<00:05:01.570> I'm

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
so I'm doing a treble there where I'm

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.300 
so I'm doing a treble there where I'm
going<00:05:01.840> from<00:05:01.960> an<00:05:02.140> opening<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.920> a<00:05:02.980> first<00:05:03.190> finger

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
going from an opening to a first finger

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.630 
going from an opening to a first finger
to<00:05:03.610> an<00:05:03.700> opening<00:05:05.250> all<00:05:06.250> right

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
to an opening all right

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.520 
to an opening all right
so<00:05:07.090> those<00:05:07.390> are<00:05:07.510> three<00:05:07.720> places<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.200> can<00:05:08.350> use<00:05:08.380> a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
so those are three places you can use a

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.880 
so those are three places you can use a
roll<00:05:08.830> either<00:05:09.550> in<00:05:09.910> place<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.480> quarter<00:05:11.050> note

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.740 

hidden<00:05:14.890> in<00:05:15.100> between<00:05:15.640> two<00:05:15.910> eighth<00:05:16.330> notes<00:05:17.790> or<00:05:18.790> a

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
hidden in between two eighth notes or a

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.410 
hidden in between two eighth notes or a
dressier<00:05:20.530> place<00:05:20.830> in<00:05:21.370> place<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.730> an<00:05:21.820> ornament

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.630 

no<00:05:25.420> Bo<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.990> figure<00:05:26.770> all<00:05:26.950> that<00:05:26.980> out<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.340> if<00:05:27.550> you
