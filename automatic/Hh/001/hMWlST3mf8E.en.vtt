 against 6 35 civilians 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.569
 the floppy hats 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.140
 this duel is not for the faint of heart 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.179
 in the middle of it 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.179
 always there if that did not happen 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.390
 for that is indefinite 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.350
 Gomez can be affected 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 new against old 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.250
 here is looking for and Dieter Nuhr in 6 with 507 hp 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.120
 the journeymen were 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.850
 the m6 and 35 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.109
 the CEOs in the 85 today again really crack 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 what the two could be so barriers 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 Let's start with the ranks 6 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.630
 are looking forward to you 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 despite the pond with a proud 507 hp 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
 the maximum speed is limited at 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 Of course, Berlin is taken care of so that you can see for yourself 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.340
 The side of the car was born no problems at all to do that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 make fun we want to be minimized as possible 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.940
 Successor becomes Jens 6 7 4 4 6 6 2 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.380
 what to play for the spot is standard on board 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.450
 even the six of them are Cloud Control 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.100
 Being back in a Formula 1 cockpit mixes it up as the winner, so it works 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.070
 until today the SC is out 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.250
 maximum power shortest switching speed 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.860
 Moths over last year 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 about it wants to do everything that the euro is 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.900
 whoever the Envia m 6 a coupe will be quite sporty character 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.510
 his form though I am Albert Babel 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.919
 But I boll the price already in the basic equipment Schleck 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
 the speedster with just under 190 000 € to book 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.969

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
 Petri 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.049
 the sound of the v10 engine Helen and evil 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 now it would be in the past 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.100
 the tables-16 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.639
 30 10 si the 286 hp then and now an absolute Börner 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.269
 As the tip later, they went to the point of going on 40 kilometers 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.969
 because as I see now book again 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.119
 So what in his time but if you want to do it now we have to do this 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.279
 Insanity only serves consumption one will see we still have to talk 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.009
 the car is offered 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.739
 1984 becomes the first in the 36 she's never built 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.160
 a total of BMW sold just under 6000 copies 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.459
 at that time make 118000 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.569
 Well-preserved specimens you get today for 12 to 15 thousand euros 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:40.259
 the equipment has become extremely modern for the time

 Hagen 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:49.579
 It is conceivable that it once a small sensation 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.509
 under the hood of the straight-six from the BMWi 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.160
 the weather is unfortunately bad 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.609
 but seawater great day so the customer should be able to 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.689
 similar to 6 with his goals for him «is simply super cool 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.249

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.249
 but we are too bad weather like before 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.209
 the weather is too bad 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.499
