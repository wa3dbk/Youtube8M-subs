face if you remember a few months ago I
made<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.450> prediction<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.350> flagship<00:00:07.859> craze

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
made this prediction the flagship craze

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.490 
made this prediction the flagship craze
will<00:00:08.519> be<00:00:08.639> over<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.690> will<00:00:09.840> revert<00:00:10.230> back<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
will be over and we will revert back to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.459 
will be over and we will revert back to
flagship<00:00:11.400> phones<00:00:11.670> being<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.269> 4.7<00:00:13.170> inches

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
flagship phones being about 4.7 inches

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.010 
flagship phones being about 4.7 inches
but<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.040> turns<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.700> clearly<00:00:15.360> quite

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
but it turns out I was clearly quite

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.080 
but it turns out I was clearly quite
wrong<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.580> next

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
wrong with that because all the next

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
wrong with that because all the next
crop<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.359> flagship<00:00:18.810> phones<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.320> mid-tier

crop of flagship phones and mid-tier
phones<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.850> plus<00:00:21.420> 5<00:00:21.840> inches<00:00:22.400> 5.2<00:00:23.400> inches<00:00:23.730> at

phones are plus 5 inches 5.2 inches at

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.349 
phones are plus 5 inches 5.2 inches at
least<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.539> 5.5<00:00:25.500> 45.7<00:00:26.189> inches<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> the

least some is 5.5 45.7 inches and the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
least some is 5.5 45.7 inches and the
other<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> trend<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.199> tablet<00:00:28.680> sales<00:00:28.859> are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
other a trend is that tablet sales are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.950 
other a trend is that tablet sales are
actually<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.840> my

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
actually going down not up because my

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200 
actually going down not up because my
original<00:00:31.320> theory<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.700> people<00:00:32.850> get

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
original theory was that as people get

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510 
original theory was that as people get
both<00:00:33.660> phone<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:33.989> tablet<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.219> media

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
both phone and tablet their media

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
both phone and tablet their media
consumption<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.210> their<00:00:36.420> phone<00:00:36.750> would<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.140> down

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
consumption on their phone would go down

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
consumption on their phone would go down
and<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.129> their<00:00:38.309> tablet<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.270> thus<00:00:39.450> far<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and up on their tablet but thus far that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.760 
and up on their tablet but thus far that
has<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.590> happened<00:00:41.180> yeah<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.559> prove<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
has not happened yeah and to prove that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
has not happened yeah and to prove that
