00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.870
 the last one is manual 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.260
 we already removed everything we are going to occupy 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.260
 here 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.150
 we prepare 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.920
 let's clean our walls to 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.310
 that nothing is left absolutely nothing 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.310
 there 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.700
 we will continue to beat 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.200
 there are couples today 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.840

 we stopped 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.109
 we clean everything we have to take everything 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 to take advantage as much as we can 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.739
 Now if we remove our clamp 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.660
 we remove our pot we will remove what 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.920
 everything everything that this requires us 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.920
 for the moment you have to remove it 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.880
 this is the mixture that has to be left 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.430
 it is not too hard nor is it very watery 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.430
 now we are going to add what is 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.020
 our grated carrot 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.400

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.850

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
 It is very easy, it is very simple and they are 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.600
 very practical the ingredients that 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.630
 we have here the home has to be 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.210

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.420
 easy and these cupcakes are delicious 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.330
 really good yes well look like that 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.660
 it was that what we are going to do we are going to 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.660
 put 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.850
 in our pieces of paper that would be these 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.980
 for cupcakes leaving it with a little 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.980
 more so let's put us 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.169
 here we are going to put the amount that 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.169
 we want to put 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.829
 that we should therefore rather of our 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.260
 always happens this always happens when 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.680
 is already prepared you can always spend a 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.260
 detail but everything has solution ok 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.810
 let's put our measure here now 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.120
 taking spoon or for example you if 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.900
 you have the one of your cupcakes I say you escape 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.970
 of your snow 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.430
 which is for your cones your tool 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.510
 is you can use it 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.510
 here is look 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.240
 we just have to fill it that would be 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.240
 as the third part three quarters 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.370
 parties counts after the of the 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.260
 half a little bit more because 40 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.510
 that is going to inflate and you are going to deform 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.990
 everything for outside and possessing would look very 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.969
 wrong 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.719
 but that's the way 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:15.090
 make a third of your account 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:16.770
 little piece of paper is everything you're going to put 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.569
 here it is 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.330
 let me show you so that more or less 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.639
 go see how it is going to be but of 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.349
 true truth that comes out delicious 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:27.120
 these cupcakes look at you notice that he is not 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:31.470
 completely full is a third part 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.960
