00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello everyone with you again I'm polina in this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.090
 video i want to show you one more 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.610
 way to create curls using ironing 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.130
 and I will use for this incentive 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.619
 from sent yes and lari and all to whom 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.180
 It is interesting to know how I did these 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.180
 curls stay with me 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.829
 but in principle it is aimed at 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 hair straightening 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 but also using steam under you can 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 make curls and waves i like mine 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 natural hair 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 pretty straightforward and such an effect I 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.620
 achieved only with the help of a hair dryer and 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.480
 hairbrushes 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.550
 Today I will use steam 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.550
 to create curls 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.949
 tiempo from very reminiscent of the iron with 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 built-in hairbrush 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.880
 holes from the side of the ironing and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 steam comes out and here it is born 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.240
 steam in this removable plastic container we 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.240
 fill the water to the maximum 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.350
 the steam generator is fixed on the table with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 using three suction cups 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.530
 return the container to its place and turn it on 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.440
 steam under the network and press the button it 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.170
 turn on style under while style under 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.180
 heats up and it takes about 60 seconds 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 I will apply heat protection to my hair 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.490
 reef chip cleaner 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.740
 and asking 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 and put this tool on the entire length of the hair 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 from root to tip 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.170
 set was a regenerating cream steam 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 under the altar and it must be applied even on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.259
 wet hair once you have little hair and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.910
 lightly wiped them with a towel 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.190
 It is worth putting this cream in a small 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.890
 quantity for the entire length of hair from the roots 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.720
 to the tips 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.519
 20 preparation use but not 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.700
 forget it must be used on 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.380
 absolutely dry hair temperature 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.800
 heating steam under regulated by 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 buttons plus and minus on the side 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.230
 ironing can be removed long 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.380
 pressing the button to change the temperature 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.840
 210 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:36.269
 maximum temperature 200 190 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.049
 180 and minimum temperature ironing 170 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.350
 degrees I choose 180 you can understand that 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.209
 steam preparation consumption when 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.430
 You close the iron and from these holes 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.049
 steam is coming 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.870
 and for making it styling us 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.709
 terminals will be useful and first I choose 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.959
 thin locks over my forehead and twist 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:06.150
 yoga ring around two fingers 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:10.219
 I wrap the lock in a ring and fix 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.670
 ring at the base with a clamp and 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:18.420
 holding the ring upright 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:26.609
 clamping it with steam under and hold 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:32.459
 so a few seconds 45 host choosing 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:36.480
 next strand and just as well comb 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.310
 First I spin the entire length 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.769
 ring dressing starting from the tips and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:50.689
 rising higher to the base hiding the tip 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.689
 strands in the middle of the ring 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:57.319
 fasten the ring at the base with 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.319
 terminals 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:08.610
 and clamping it with steam under and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.610
 keep it up for a few seconds 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:22.230
 stock speech 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:42.330
 this man when all the strands are twisted 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.339
 in rings and fixed with creams 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.520
 I can only wait until 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:50.960
 cool completely and fix 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.789
 fix them with hairspray 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.650
 that's all hide and seek completely cooled and 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.169
 it's time to remove the terminals 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.569
 well i do that with the front strands ever since 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.659
 strands that I twisted in the first 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.659
 turn 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 when all the terminals are pulled out and strands 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.890
 dissolved and i will fix them again with 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.890
 using hair spray 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.679
 and having waited until the varnish is completely absorbed 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.589
 locks frizz dries up i cant 

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:39.099
 head forward and bring my fingers to the roots 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:41.619
 hair whipping slightly hairs that's all 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.529
