like every time I hit with our slinky

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.090 
like every time I hit with our slinky
luck<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.290> was<00:01:54.380> sides<00:01:54.590> going<00:01:54.950> around

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
luck and it was sides going around

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.289 
luck and it was sides going around
