00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.970 

I<00:00:11.530> think<00:00:12.310> every<00:00:12.910> movie<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:13.900> deals<00:00:14.170> with<00:00:14.410> the

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
I think every movie that deals with the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.660 
I think every movie that deals with the
Mafia<00:00:15.340> is<00:00:15.640> gonna<00:00:15.970> remind

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
Mafia is gonna remind

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
definitely the thriller throughout but

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.030 
definitely the thriller throughout but
it's<00:00:28.849> very<00:00:29.540> different<00:00:29.840> anyway<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:30.439> don't<00:00:30.560> see

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
it's very different anyway you don't see

program and friends it's it's very very

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.710 
program and friends it's it's very very
different<00:00:37.129> in<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.400> way<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.850> I<00:00:38.059> really<00:00:38.150> liked

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
different in that way and I really liked

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.369 
different in that way and I really liked
that<00:00:39.080> I<00:00:39.739> kind<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.640> had<00:00:41.059> wondered<00:00:41.449> why<00:00:41.690> maybe

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
that I kind of had wondered why maybe

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.700 
that I kind of had wondered why maybe
hasn't<00:00:42.739> been<00:00:42.860> done<00:00:43.010> before<00:00:43.400> so<00:00:43.660> um<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.470> yeah<00:00:45.680> I

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
hasn't been done before so um so yeah I

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
was I was really keen on the idea of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.280

I think the most exciting scene to film
so<00:01:01.840> far<00:01:01.870> was<00:01:02.470> there's<00:01:03.130> a<00:01:03.220> scene<00:01:03.520> where<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:04.180> I'm

move into this and then with this long
hair<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.830> have<00:01:50.920> for<00:01:51.880> this<00:01:52.030> movie<00:01:52.420> it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
hair that I have for this movie it's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.080 
hair that I have for this movie it's
flying<00:01:52.900> everywhere<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.369> was<00:01:54.580> very<00:01:54.729> hard

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
flying everywhere and it was very hard

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.590 
flying everywhere and it was very hard
that<00:01:55.300> day<00:01:55.330> because<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.350> Sun<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:58.000> way<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.360> we

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
that day because the Sun the way that we

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.280 
that day because the Sun the way that we
shoot<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.140> movie<00:01:59.500> very<00:02:00.840> Italian<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.050> think

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
shoot on this movie very Italian I think

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.620 
shoot on this movie very Italian I think
way<00:02:02.560> of<00:02:02.740> shooting<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.729> wait<00:02:03.970> for<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
way of shooting is you wait for the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.210 
way of shooting is you wait for the
light<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:05.140> perfect<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.890> when<00:02:06.070> it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
light to be perfect and when it's

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.699 
light to be perfect and when it's
overcast<00:02:06.670> or<00:02:06.940> whatever<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.380> know<00:02:08.500> wait

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
overcast or whatever you you know wait

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.859 
overcast or whatever you you know wait
for<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.010> clouds<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.459> pass<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.450> see<00:02:10.630> Luke

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
for the clouds to pass and you see Luke

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.410 
for the clouds to pass and you see Luke
and<00:02:11.170> Ludo<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.760> everybody<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:13.239> these

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and Ludo and everybody with these

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.690 
and Ludo and everybody with these
magnifying<00:02:14.070> eyepieces<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.430> kind<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
magnifying eyepieces to kind of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.130 
magnifying eyepieces to kind of
calculate<00:02:16.209> when<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.570> clouds<00:02:16.780> are<00:02:16.959> going<00:02:17.019> to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
calculate when the clouds are going to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.890 
calculate when the clouds are going to
pass<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.790> would<00:02:18.940> have<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> stop<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.630> 40

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
pass so we would have to stop for 40

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.240 
pass so we would have to stop for 40
minutes<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.350> then<00:02:20.470> jump<00:02:20.739> back<00:02:20.860> into<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
minutes and then jump back into the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.490 
minutes and then jump back into the
scene<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.940> again<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.080> everything

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
scene and do it again so just everything

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.080 
of normalcy it's it's just I knew it
would<00:04:40.740> be<00:04:40.830> something<00:04:41.039> very<00:04:41.370> very<00:04:41.550> fun<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.060> play

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
would be something very very fun to play

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.600 
would be something very very fun to play
and<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:43.229> automatically<00:04:43.919> when<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.100> was<00:04:44.280> reading

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
and so automatically when I was reading

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.250 
and so automatically when I was reading
it<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:44.850> could<00:04:45.060> kind<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.360> see<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.750> all<00:04:45.900> playing

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
it I could kind of see it all playing

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.290 
it I could kind of see it all playing
out<00:04:46.410> in<00:04:46.560> my<00:04:46.680> head<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.220> wondering<00:04:47.940> what<00:04:48.120> Luke
