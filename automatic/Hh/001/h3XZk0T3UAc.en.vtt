00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:14.960
 how did we say that to the throat 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.960
 turned out from this side 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.340
 solid seams were here and here by 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.860
 that tape 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:43.050
 the rest is all for bent profiles means 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.300
 these places here here are punched 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.850
 cooking hole the same on 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 lower flanging further welded on 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.969
 high current on the top three 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.850
 sharp as a decline mode something 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:08.229
 sharply pressed the button released and soft 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 such a strong tack is obtained and 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:17.070
 sharpen very easy everything turned out 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.250
 here below is also the sum of what and here they are 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.190
 also for tack 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 welded it into a run everywhere shorter 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.479
 dots welded in a run to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.500
 not much to pull the metal from the potter 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.970
 handy seemingly shape turned out 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.970
 if you take a look like this 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:08.360
 ruler here it is about 5 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:12.709
 millimeters antigravity layer goes if 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 to report back putty it turns out 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:32.340
 flat surface will be the same 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:34.970
 here so here it suits me why 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.329
 welding did not show 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.700
 because it's a secret we 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.970
 garage masters people secret their 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.150
 I do not give out secrets 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:52.410
 just tell us how it is done 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.130
 joke of course I don't want to spoil the camera 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.160
 camera matrix by welding this second 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:03.299
 it's very long and tedious to think of cooking everything 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.910
 know how to make out for example 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.090
 theory how it is brewed I explain 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.730
 run-up 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.850
 here they grabbed them first 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.709
 then here here and like that 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.190
 points near each other we fold and 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.190
 boil it all 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.709
 in the end, here is the result 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.230
 polished with this here now Bulgarians 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.670
 point and this little disk 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.870
 neatly at high speed not much 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:45.120
 pressing quickly but stroking the seam and all 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.159
 means immediately to people who say 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.760
 begin to write like it was not easier 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:56.530
 new box cook new wing and the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:00.579
 I will tell people like that once we have it 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.060
 repairing it means that means it means or 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:08.680
 it's weekend holidays or man 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.590
 already unable to repair this financially 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.629
 plan or anything else is what the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.150
 there is some reason 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.900
 have to repair anyway 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.030
 This repair machine is not new and 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.190
 accordingly some strong costs 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.729
 because of this, buy a new box or 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.560
 it was not even a box of sense any better 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.770
 here it is not all to do here 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.400
 what will happen now I will endure the glass 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:43.030
 USS fiberglass putty 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.550
 just put the form below will not be anything 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.060
 neither putty is a large layer 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 sealant then put antigravel on top 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.800
 after it dries after 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.010
 as the nozzle sealant that's all the same 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.460
 fiberglass putty will bring and 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.680
 after painting through this hole 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 spray some 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.409
 anti-corrosion composition oily or 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.629
 dinitrol or 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:12.409
 mobil let's see we led stinks strongly 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.989
 probably meters of steel strength well, so here 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.469
 possible in principle 

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:20.679
 it took me all 2 hours to do it 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.809
 throat 

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:27.849
 now there is a body there 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:30.319
 periodically bend it pull out 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.439
 putty and cook further under 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.559
 primer 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:38.860
 good luck to all guys again with the holidays 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.860
 of all
