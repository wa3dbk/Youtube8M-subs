00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.070
 Hello Dear YouTube I am very happy. Professionals of today is one 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 Great day Sijaric these had the invitation to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.890
 on the second in March 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.749
 and an i-pad Libya will be sent out 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.820
 and that's a great thing Tel 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.810
 and then we will get presented a new iPad per apartment wonder 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.989
 2x Lindenmair HAZ 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.050
 whether it looks like it looks like the invitation here so we have 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.750
 the sky-sender tickle and that's why it's so leafy and a bit gone 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.790
 behind it you can see an iPad 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 striking in the blog 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.229
 louder quieter and then up 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.300
 and shouted at project sponsors 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.670
 likewise, nothing has changed, so East is still an old one 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.630
 penthouse 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.350
 not from ESMA 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.720
 it concludes that concludes that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.020
 the iPad itself 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.990
 so optically it will not change 40 so probably year like 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.010
 already announced by us so 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.910
 visually also change with the rounded Xing 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.950
 and reason 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 Year and of course the FaceTime camera titles are going to be found in it 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 for FaceTime 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.520
 to get customers closer to Soma Union 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.870
 Cannes she juror between persons Daniel Erben only baby Euro 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.210
 So come and see what happens in 2011 with us 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.870
 translated a bit freely 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.620
 us she yes that's interesting 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.660
 that is a bit wider 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.140
 So it does not only sound like half past eleven now 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.750
 and of course the iPad is around but 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.040
 who knows if it really is about the iPad then 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.940
 of course eggs OS 4 points 3 is time that gets along 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.050
 and how overdue almost 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.640
 and Jan connection with the new iPad also very interesting what we then there 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.740
 still all can expect what may be easier still comes on 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.070
 probably that's not technically much new 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.770
 and already the well-known things summarizes sharing camera and new is the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.080
 so a little fancier 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.039
 battery performance 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.979
 a yes and then seen probably Apple will be there then again 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.540
 a little something on top of this often speaks with ten hours but more yes 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.340
 always good on mobile devices although some of you might find the honey beating 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.990
 so 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.820
 Find out how weird Wolf battery power is on mobile devices 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.109
 with the most important 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.549
 in my view 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.049
 that's surprising the whole one can of course watch it live again 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.079
 compares played 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.549
 and that will be missed by us then on the second of March and 7pm its 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:36.999
 Not 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.629
 "We'll get in before 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.450
 The End 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.189
 We are speculating now that we are ours 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.629
 our speculative round 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.820
 convene 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.369
 and this is also slim with 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.569
 Percent at this point I will not announce for whom we are 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.209
 have decided from the video and still support us 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:55.579
 becomes 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.559
 but that will then be announced in a predicament and that too 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:02.329
 Date of the poets again or topics and there if we have 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.659
 announce when and this round starts then our little Apple worries 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.859
 Roland me very sad as he is now called that is still all open 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.700
 you will see that as a result of Twitter, then you will become something like that 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.659
 do not miss Walter we will write such things all year round 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.119
 Follow or like on Facebook Funds or anything else never hurts so well 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.840
 2 through and I want 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.050
 and you are then not always turn what's going on for us then too 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.539
 pushes if the abo function does not work 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.609
 Now you can not leave the AWO modules as well 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.019
 By the way, by the way, YouTube at the end of the day is a trifle all questions 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.710
 Why 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.550
 and we'll do it now and there are others on YouTube or YouTube 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.729
 anywhere else and everyone knows that already becomes known on the second day of the fair 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.680
 unfortunately that is not so the Zonda often noticed 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.099
 that's among our subscribers year there are still people out there who are relying 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.760
 that we bring them the information, so to speak 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.459
 that's nice in principle and that's why "we want these people, too 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.299
 did not want to disappoint the Â«Les Verts books know and know and 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.239
 thus the beer flows has been unique 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.310
 but for that is not even thought honestly that for the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.880
 People who want to sit there first and rejoice or themselves 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.230
 maybe even wanted to buy an iPad and now, of course, buy none 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.349
 because they asked for a couple in March 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.719
 but that means, of course, on the second of March it will be presented that is then 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:25.800
 In spite of the trade then January February March April would be Maya around times 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 June so fit to shoot around in Germany appear 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.939
 Well 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.940
 For this, the mouth must be fuzzy percent I hope you are with 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.230
 Johnsons I know that now just push around here so much 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.419
 Before the Best of Twitter I do not have this just because we're so Ott 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.230
 twitter-follower Geisen but really because then we get the information from Wolf 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.290
 Percent of women when and how and where and ditto customers all that us 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.940
 this year some of you say one thing Hey we did not know each other and missed 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.309
 so 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.289
 forget about promises on Twitter like 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.289
 Jens Spahn gullies TV out Follow us on Twitter 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.680
 Here you can make my video about everything the snack would be overkill 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.680
 then again calculator Canori only makes videos and expensive 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.930
 hard to please everyone and everything 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.029
 the team which talks about that 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.029
 I'm doing that I'm really good now and I'm sure 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.219
