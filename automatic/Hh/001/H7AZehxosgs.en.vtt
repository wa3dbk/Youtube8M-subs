00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.539 
hearts the same color that I decided on
a<00:02:01.390> little<00:02:01.659> bit<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.900> contrast<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.680> using<00:02:03.310> big

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
a little bit of contrast and using big

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.430 
a little bit of contrast and using big
green<00:02:03.850> polish<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.540> exactly<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.200> same<00:02:05.229> way

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
green polish in exactly the same way

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.540 
green polish in exactly the same way
just<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.280> couple<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.640> drops<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.119> Polish<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.229> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
just a couple of drops of Polish and in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.309 
just a couple of drops of Polish and in
maybe<00:02:09.550> three<00:02:09.880> or<00:02:09.910> four<00:02:10.179> drops<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.690> nail<00:02:11.110> polish

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
maybe three or four drops of nail polish

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.590 
maybe three or four drops of nail polish
thinner<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.980> you've<00:02:12.490> got<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.819> thinned<00:02:13.480> out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
thinner and you've got your thinned out

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.360 
thinner and you've got your thinned out
polish<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.200> makes<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.620> look<00:02:14.739> like<00:02:14.800> watercolor

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
polish and makes it look like watercolor

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.140 
polish and makes it look like watercolor
it's<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.760> cute

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.430 

because<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> polish<00:02:22.540> was<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.870> thin<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> dries

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
because the polish was so thin it dries

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.110 
because the polish was so thin it dries
