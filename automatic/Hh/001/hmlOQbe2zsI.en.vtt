where<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.780> well<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.770> boat<00:02:05.979> was<00:02:06.190> running

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
where the well the boat was running

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.480 
where the well the boat was running
really<00:02:07.000> loose<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.990> few<00:02:08.560> times<00:02:08.800> prior<00:02:09.220> to

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
really loose so a few times prior to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.840 
really loose so a few times prior to
that<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.850> had<00:02:09.970> acted<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> same<00:02:10.479> way<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.260> was

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
that it had acted the same way it was

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.380 
that it had acted the same way it was
just<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.240> one<00:02:13.630> particular<00:02:14.410> time<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
just that that one particular time it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.770 
just that that one particular time it
just<00:02:16.390> happened<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.560> snap<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.390> was

conscious<00:02:20.230> through<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> whole<00:02:20.740> thing<00:02:21.010> one

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
conscious through the whole thing one

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.940 
conscious through the whole thing one
minute<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:21.880> were<00:02:22.090> going<00:02:22.330> along<00:02:22.510> 115<00:02:23.500> miles<00:02:23.770> an

your thoughts well I never lost

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.850 
your thoughts well I never lost
consciousness<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.930> first<00:02:40.930> thing<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.350> saw<00:02:41.590> was

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
consciousness the first thing I saw was

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.009 
consciousness the first thing I saw was
the<00:02:42.190> boat<00:02:42.580> diving<00:02:43.150> into<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> water<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
the boat diving into the water in the

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.330 
the boat diving into the water in the
water<00:02:44.200> coming<00:02:44.650> at<00:02:44.800> me<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:46.090> helmet<00:02:46.360> acted<00:02:46.870> as<00:02:47.019> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
water coming at me my helmet acted as a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.870 
water coming at me my helmet acted as a
like<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> diving<00:02:48.970> helmet<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> could<00:02:50.140> actually

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
like a diving helmet so I could actually

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.900 
like a diving helmet so I could actually
see<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.330> underwater<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.670> mast

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
see that I was underwater and the mast

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.570 
see that I was underwater and the mast
the<00:02:55.320> helmet<00:02:56.320> didn't<00:02:56.590> fill<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:57.040> water<00:02:57.100> it

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
the helmet didn't fill up with water it

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.570 
the helmet didn't fill up with water it
held<00:02:57.820> air<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.050> could<00:02:59.500> see<00:02:59.980> very<00:03:00.010> clearly<00:03:00.340> and

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
held air so I could see very clearly and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.370 
held air so I could see very clearly and
the<00:03:03.580> boat<00:03:03.790> started<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.420> rise<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.959> felt<00:03:05.230> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
the boat started to rise I felt that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.460 
the boat started to rise I felt that
happening<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.550> was<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:06.970> movie<00:03:07.930> that

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
happening and it was like a movie that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380 
happening and it was like a movie that
you<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:08.800> on<00:03:08.950> TV<00:03:09.160> where<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.640> submarine<00:03:10.239> is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
you see on TV where a submarine is

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.630 
you see on TV where a submarine is
rising<00:03:10.989> from<00:03:11.230> from<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.800> ocean<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> water

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
rising from from the ocean and the water

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.449 
rising from from the ocean and the water
is<00:03:12.910> rolling<00:03:13.480> off<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.050> sides<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.100> I

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
is rolling off the sides of it and I

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.699 
is rolling off the sides of it and I
actually<00:03:15.640> saw<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.120> water<00:03:16.930> rolling<00:03:17.230> off<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
actually saw the water rolling off the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.100 
actually saw the water rolling off the
sides<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> boat<00:03:18.430> nice<00:03:18.730> surface<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.870> then

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
sides of the boat nice surface and then

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.250 
sides of the boat nice surface and then
as<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.790> said<00:03:21.970> before<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.300> looked<00:03:22.540> across<00:03:22.690> from

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
as I said before I looked across from

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.039 
as I said before I looked across from
Michelle<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.790> crawled<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.810> time

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
Michelle and crawled out at that time

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.199 
Michelle and crawled out at that time
you<00:03:26.680> suffered<00:03:27.040> some<00:03:27.160> pretty<00:03:27.400> bad<00:03:27.610> injuries

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
you suffered some pretty bad injuries

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.660 
you suffered some pretty bad injuries
how<00:03:29.049> did<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.320> feel<00:03:29.590> in<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.920> water<00:03:30.190> because

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
how did you feel in the water because

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.600 
how did you feel in the water because
you<00:03:30.790> were<00:03:30.880> actually<00:03:31.239> swimming<00:03:31.510> across<00:03:31.900> to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
you were actually swimming across to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.170 
you were actually swimming across to
Michelle<00:03:33.610> Maynard<00:03:34.110> well<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.140> never<00:03:35.290> really

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
Michelle Maynard well I never really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.380 
Michelle Maynard well I never really
thought<00:03:37.180> about

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
thought about

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.470 
thought about
my<00:03:38.990> arms<00:03:39.230> or<00:03:39.410> my<00:03:39.440> legs<00:03:39.770> they<00:03:40.100> were<00:03:40.160> there<00:03:40.520> so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
my arms or my legs they were there so

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.150 
my arms or my legs they were there so
the<00:03:41.870> first<00:03:42.110> thing<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.410> did<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.650> looked<00:03:42.950> across

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
the first thing I did I looked across

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.780 
the first thing I did I looked across
and<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.670> didn't<00:03:43.880> see<00:03:44.060> Michelle<00:03:44.450> in<00:03:44.950> his<00:03:45.950> cockpit

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and I didn't see Michelle in his cockpit

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.960 
and I didn't see Michelle in his cockpit
so<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.420> went<00:03:48.410> from<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> water<00:03:49.490> across<00:03:49.850> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
so I went from the water across the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.910 
so I went from the water across the
cockpit<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.840> he<00:03:50.990> wasn't<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.440> there<00:03:51.590> then<00:03:51.800> I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
cockpit and he wasn't in there then I

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.310 
cockpit and he wasn't in there then I
looked<00:03:52.670> behind<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.180> boat<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.690> saw<00:03:53.960> him<00:03:54.200> in

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
looked behind the boat and I saw him in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.260 
looked behind the boat and I saw him in
the<00:03:54.380> water<00:03:54.710> with<00:03:55.010> his<00:03:55.160> head<00:03:55.310> down<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:55.850> jumped

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
the water with his head down so I jumped

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.850 
the water with his head down so I jumped
in<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.450> started<00:03:56.960> swimming<00:03:57.200> toward<00:03:57.620> him<00:03:57.740> and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
in and started swimming toward him and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.450 
in and started swimming toward him and
then<00:03:58.520> he<00:03:59.510> just<00:03:59.800> lifted<00:04:00.800> his<00:04:00.920> head<00:04:01.040> up<00:04:01.100> and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
then he just lifted his head up and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.850 
then he just lifted his head up and
waved<00:04:01.700> toward<00:04:02.150> me<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.480> then<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:03.530> stopped

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
waved toward me and then I just stopped

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.760 
waved toward me and then I just stopped
and<00:04:04.220> at<00:04:04.490> that<00:04:04.790> second<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:05.510> Hermetic<00:04:06.440> boat

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
and at that second the Hermetic boat

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.920 
and at that second the Hermetic boat
pulled<00:04:07.070> up
