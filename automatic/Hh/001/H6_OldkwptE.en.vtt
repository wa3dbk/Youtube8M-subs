00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
just see this type of view birthday you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.380 
just see this type of view birthday you
can<00:01:38.670> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> absolute<00:01:41.490> solian

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
can kind of see that the absolute solian

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.700 
can kind of see that the absolute solian
has<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> boxy<00:01:44.040> fit<00:01:45.710> then

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
has a little bit more of a boxy fit then

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490 
has a little bit more of a boxy fit then
the<00:01:47.009> absolado<00:01:48.049> but<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> know<00:01:49.290> that's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the absolado but you know that's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.850 
the absolado but you know that's
probably<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:50.600> because

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.810 

that's<00:01:58.860> probably<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.310> cause<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.180> thing<00:02:03.740> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
that's probably just cause my thing so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.889 
that's probably just cause my thing so
going<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.869> plate<00:02:07.259> instead<00:02:07.829> pattern<00:02:08.899> for

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
on turf and a pretty good on soft ground
because<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> studs<00:02:54.120> are<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> bit<00:02:54.510> longer

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
because the studs are a bit longer

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.479 
because the studs are a bit longer

compared to the idea zeros my I zeros

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.530 
compared to the idea zeros my I zeros
are<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.829> lot<00:03:02.160> thinner<00:03:02.400> these<00:03:02.940> ones<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:03.239> really

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
are a lot thinner these ones are really

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.500 
are a lot thinner these ones are really
stiff<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> gita<00:03:06.390> is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
stiff and then this is a gita is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.690 
stiff and then this is a gita is

you've<00:03:09.150> got<00:03:09.359> just<00:03:10.049> these<00:03:10.260> fins<00:03:10.950> kind<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.549> going

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you've got just these fins kind of going

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.080 
you've got just these fins kind of going
off<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> side<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.290> they<00:03:13.500> come<00:03:13.709> around<00:03:14.090> if

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
off to the side and they come around if

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.270 
off to the side and they come around if
you<00:03:15.209> can<00:03:15.329> see<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> then<00:03:16.410> they<00:03:16.620> go<00:03:16.650> back

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
you can see that and then they go back

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.910 
you can see that and then they go back
down<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.450> have<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.780> white<00:03:19.470> part<00:03:19.709> right

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
down and you have this white part right

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.090 
down and you have this white part right
here<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.840> some<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:24.769> don't<00:03:25.769> know<00:03:25.980> what

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
here and you have some I don't know what

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.819 
here and you have some I don't know what
to<00:03:26.130> call<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:27.260> thinned<00:03:28.260> out<00:03:28.410> from<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
to call it thinned out from the

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.490 
to call it thinned out from the
soleplate<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.840> bend<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.319> all<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
soleplate and so you can bend it all the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.620 
soleplate and so you can bend it all the
easier<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.310> they<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:35.450> toe<00:03:36.450> protection

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
easier and they have a toe protection

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.780 
easier and they have a toe protection
like<00:03:37.109> a<00:03:37.170> rubberized<00:03:37.620> toe<00:03:38.549> protection<00:03:38.760> piece

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
like a rubberized toe protection piece

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.250 
like a rubberized toe protection piece
um<00:03:41.790> now<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.420> zones<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.989> mean<00:03:43.139> that's

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
um now it's zones I mean that's

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.120 
um now it's zones I mean that's
basically<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.859> whole<00:03:44.190> point<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.910> LZ<00:03:46.130> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
basically the whole point of LZ the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.970 
basically the whole point of LZ the
absolution<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.630> zones<00:03:48.930> are<00:03:49.170> identical<00:03:49.799> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
absolution is the zones are identical to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.770 
absolution is the zones are identical to
the<00:03:50.100> LZ<00:03:50.220> they<00:03:50.639> have<00:03:50.760> all<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.239> same<00:03:51.420> zones

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the LZ they have all of the same zones

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.580 
the LZ they have all of the same zones
all<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.560> same<00:03:52.769> material<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.430> same<00:03:53.790> level

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
all the same material all the same level

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.229 
all the same material all the same level
then<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.829> get<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> bit<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.250> drop<00:03:56.609> off<00:03:56.849> on<00:03:57.120> the

then you get a bit of drop off on the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.569 
then you get a bit of drop off on the
absolado<00:03:57.780> also<00:03:58.650> there's<00:03:58.859> definitely<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.340> price

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
absolado also there's definitely a price

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.720
