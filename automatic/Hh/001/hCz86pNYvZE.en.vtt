00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.550
 Hello everyone and welcome once all 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.839
 now more to the channel today we are going to talk about 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.970
 products for lips 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.050
 in particular lipsticks lipstick 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.580
 classic 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.160
 I'm going to show you my favorite colors 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.009
 for the fall / winter season of this 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.990
 year and to do it even better the 5 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.480
 labials that I 'm going to teach you are crazy 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.670
 the most expensive costs eleven euros with 50 and 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.920
 the cheapest round the 4 euros you go to 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.870
 have links on where to buy them and 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.820
 the exact prices on the blog nothing more 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.040
 we started the first labial of which you 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.870
 I want to talk is this way you have 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.150
 seen in the previous video is a tone 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.830
 very nice orange brown costs me 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.840
 much daring with this type of tones 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.970
 first because I'm scared whenever 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.170
 yellow in the teeth and also because 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.940
 are tones that I'm not in 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 used to it but yes I think it is 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.480
 important from time to time leave a 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.030
 little of the typical things to which 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 We are accustomed and lip it 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.810
 Cost of cheap prices are great 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.340
 to be able to do that because if 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.440
 example I would have bought biaín stele or 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.630
 you liked the price of counting the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.910
 four euros allows me to dare to 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.320
 buy it without feeling that if I do not 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.360
 he liked to be throwing a lot of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.940
 money in this case the experiment came out 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.040
 all right 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.350
 and as we see a color that I love I 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.270
 It seems lovely ideal for this time 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.520
 of the year of this same collection had 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.610
 two more colors there is another one that is a tone 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.380
 like eggplant but very dark it's like 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 eggplant and dark brown its color 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580
 also quite special and I do not rule out 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.440
 buy it because as sedition limited 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.150
 only things in the moment afterwards no longer 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.710
 you can take it and well the collection in 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.930
 general is fine so something that 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.820
 It's worth looking at the next one that you 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.740
 I'm going to teach is the sleep is the first 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.930
 lipstick that I try on this brand has 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.000
 surprised a lot and congratulations on the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.040
 same family of color as the previous 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.980
 that I have shown you his brownish tone 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.050
 with a slight orange hue I think 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.490
 that is a little bit dark news is a 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.310
 very versatile color I'm using it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.960
 a lot for daily is pretty pigmented 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.970
 although it may be the lightest of all 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.010
 those that I will show you but very comfortable 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.140
 of wearing very moisturizing on the lips 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.240
 it favors the color that I like 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 I say this kind of brown give me 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.780
 always a little scared and I liked it 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 so much that it has given me enough curiosity 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.979
 for trying more lipstick 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.689
 and there is a tone called back and that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.069
 I really want to try the 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.620
 next christmas I have taught you 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.080
 also in a previous video is from boy 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.450
 from the game in game collection 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.750
 labials are called soft damon and this is 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.030
 tone 27 is like a dark raspberry 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.160
 very beautiful the formula is very moisturizing 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.410
 very comfortable on the lips and again this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 Limited edition is also a collection 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.220
 who has been in Kiko for some time, I do not know 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.599
 how much longer will he be because now 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 same is coexisting with the collection 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.580
 Christmas but I do not know how much longer 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.549
 will be available so if you want a 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.459
 tone of this range a raspberry tone 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.680
 dark burgundy type this is a very 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.260
 good that incidentally has a profiler 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.180
 I have it and I recommend that you 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.640
 you buy together because it shows 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 difference of putting it without profiler to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.810
 put with profiler lasts longer and the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.830
 finish is as much more accurate this 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.959
 is I'm going to teach now is the most 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.930
 daring of all more than anything because it is 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.450
 the darkest is a tone or aubergine 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.450
 bonito is almost matte but does not dry the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.880
 lips is an infinite mascara and the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.430
 tone 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.440
 It's 120 and karting edge is pretty dark 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.090
 but also not excessively free is a 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.190
 color that can be worn I think it's a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 ideal color to go out for dinner 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.060
 Now that the holidays come by 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.410
 night if you do not dare to try this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.450
 kind of shades so dark because no 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.790
 you know if you are going to use them later 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.040
 good option to buy something that has a 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.810
 moderate price so that if after 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.790
 we use it as much as we thought 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.650
 at the beginning there was not an outlay 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.450
 so big of money and finally I'm going 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.840
 to talk about my favorite that is the one 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.030
 I'm wearing and it's the blake tone of 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.030
 blake lively from the exclusive collection 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.520
 the reds de l'oréal I do not know if this 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.350
 collection is limited if it is going to stay 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.210
 in the fixed linear I think it's very 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.250
 likely to stay are fixed on 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.810
 all because he is having a lot of success 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.550
 there are many colors that I like about this 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.230
 collection but from the first moment 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.320
 I saw her I knew that the first one that was going 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.420
 to buy was this is a very red color 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.950
 classic I think it 's that kind of red that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.480
 he has to have everyone in his 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.060
 collection 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.920
 As you can see, mate is very comfortable in 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.450
 lips there are people who do not like the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.760
 smell of the lipsticks of l'oréal but 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.430
 I love it and good the color is and how 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.290
 I say I think it's super elegant I feel 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.180
 which is very sophisticated I think it's the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.400
 what else will I use of all and although 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.260
 it costs eleven euros with 50 something I follow 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.639
 considering low cost I think it's not a 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.440
 very big investment to talk and to 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.840
 that I think it can be taken out 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.150
 quite broken because as I tell you 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.440
 it looks like the classic red that should have 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.210
 everyone and that should have its 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.040
 site in any collection is this 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.979
 type of red that makes the teeth more 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.419
 whites the brightest skin tone does not 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.580
 I know and the truth is that I'm sure that 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.800
 you are going to see a lot in more videos and 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.449
 in more blogs because they are very lipsticks 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.610
 good and the color selection is 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.889
 incredible and of course if only 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.510
 you can choose a lipstick and only 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.490
 you want to buy us a lipstick for this 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.960
 season I definitely recommend this 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.850
 with any of this collection up 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.650
 here today's video has been a short one 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.720
 I hope you liked it and that you have 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.120
 got some idea to edit me at 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.030
