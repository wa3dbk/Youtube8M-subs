00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 yes it smells like hair I decided to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.850
 to show you my hair because I 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.540
 realized that I was demonstrating 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:22.830
 germans so it's done a kind of 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:24.900
 tristar a lot of people it's nothing 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.789
 for a new video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 and today we want to talk about my 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 cabinet routine so I have for habit 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.710
 to consider that my routine is rather 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.620
 simple and after that maybe the reviews 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.570
 will diverge everyday I will help them 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.890
 hair with my hat I will put the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 composition in info bar 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 after not spraying my hair 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.690
 I apply my divine conditioners 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.230
 crimes of nature and in the end I have for 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.239
 give it all I apply my exit from 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 cars were cacao which is almost finished 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 level shampoo so I do in 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 the ideal good nights a week 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.869
 before my shampoo all four 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.890
 weeks i'm going for a protein sense and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.030
 other weeks 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.080
 I alternate between moisturizing treatments are 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 fed without here so in terms of 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 protein care and I tell you now 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.880
 the father mayonnaise or rs but it did not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880
 always been the case 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.530
 after another mask it varies between 28 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.460
 the henna mask with the lawyer hide the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.670
 banana etc 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:00.430
 so for my shampoo I tell you the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:03.070
 shampoo crimes of nature then a 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.890
 conditioner I was blinis 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.320
 rs conditioners that i love 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.390
 frankly it's one more the beginning 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.350
 tells us he will never let go of me month and 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.160
 at the end 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.040
 so either I leave the conditioner of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 rs 120 c knowing that this is not the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.680
 presence one after shampoo without 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.050
 rinse his game reims and in the end like 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.820
 I finally at the end of the month I hydrated 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.250
 always shock after shampooing 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.410
 so we start the vapo process again 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.050
 divine conditioner and sings i of 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.170
 cocoa shea 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.130
 then a massage of the scalp g28 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.930
 fetish then massages to should 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.350
 to be once a week sometimes 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.320
 I forget 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.120
 so it's either eight mustard or 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.239
 Quick olives in hand a leather massage 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.980
 hairy once a week so that's it 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.930
 my routine is really simple me 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 do not want to do more complicated 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.260
 because more complicated it becomes more 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.690
 binding and who says more 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.470
 binding says less regular so 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.060
 do not hesitate to ask me all 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.850
 the questions you want a 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.590
 comment below this video 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.790
 now we will go to the council for 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.580
 small budgets 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.760
 if you have a small budget you have to 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.080
 think 5 and effective 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.930
 what I mean by a simple and 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.569
 effective than by car when you do 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.540
 your youtube search is very 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.420
 attempting to copy the roads there are 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.750
 routines with super machine products 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.790
 of products that are found nowhere 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.700
 frankly if a product toussaint 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.930
 works on your hair 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.459
 give yourself one there it will be fine 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.349
 for example you can work with 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.390
 one city from the moment 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.849
 it works for all when I say 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.000
 for all and scalp massage 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.940
 it's the age and the skin like 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.799
 works trial 3 and induce if she 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.870
 works for actually four classes 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.709
 that's fine for me for example I 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.359
 know that I could very well 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.010
 worked only with olive oil 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.850
 you must have a shampoo after 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.979
 shampoo if you have a tight budget 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.330
 refer to the press a point without 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:34.150
 rinsing since it will do everything so that's it 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.520
 so a shampoo to the preference in 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.990
 massage an effective mule for 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.949
 four that I quoted you for your 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.139
 care 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.580
 frankly we can make saints to 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.789
 side of stuff from his very simple kitchen 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.710
 a banal for protein care 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.990
 and an egg is good enough you 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.849
 do not have to invest in r 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.070
 mayonnaise like the baduy lellouche 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.699
 you can choose 2 us in oil 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.520
 olive but sunflower his two sons 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:12.130
 super efficient and not very expensive your 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.110
 pot meal is like your them 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.870
 care is not going there it's water from 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.289
 the oil you can have an oil and 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.930
 your water is all that's a vapo these 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.180
 regular or regular visits to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.880
 you are very well 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.639
 so you'll have your water hat 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.889
 of the oil you have chosen your 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.229
 shampoo your after shampoo without 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.440
 rinsing 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:41.960
 you can do a routine with 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.970
 very simple but effective products 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.970
 this was the only one 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:06.920
 are you not seeing anything because I am 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:06.920
 means he sees nothing that's the way
