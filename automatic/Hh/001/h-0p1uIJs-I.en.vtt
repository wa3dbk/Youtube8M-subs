on<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.600> video<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.239> we've

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
on this video is that this is we've

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
on this video is that this is we've
cleaned<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.860> haven't<00:00:38.070> run<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> about

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
cleaned this I haven't run it in about

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.049 
cleaned this I haven't run it in about
36<00:00:39.360> hours<00:00:40.250> but<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> I'm

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
36 hours but you can see that I'm

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.810 
36 hours but you can see that I'm
touching<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> muffler<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:44.040> cold<00:00:44.430> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
touching the muffler and it's cold it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220 
touching the muffler and it's cold it's
I'm<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.210> touching<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.989> prove<00:00:46.170> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I'm not touching it and to prove that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.010 
I'm not touching it and to prove that
point<00:00:46.739> I've<00:00:47.010> got<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> digital<00:00:48.020> thermometer

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
point I've got a digital thermometer

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110 
point I've got a digital thermometer
with<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> laser<00:00:49.980> pointer<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> see

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
with a laser pointer and you can see

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
with a laser pointer and you can see
that<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.590> keep<00:00:52.739> steady<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that that is if I can keep steady here

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.340 
that that is if I can keep steady here
right<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.850> 60<00:00:54.360> degrees<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.050> room

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
right around 60 degrees so it's room

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.310 
right around 60 degrees so it's room
temperature<00:00:55.879> okay<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.570> point<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
temperature okay what my point here is I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
temperature okay what my point here is I
want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.620> show<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.250> easy<00:00:59.539> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
want to show you just how easy this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.709 
want to show you just how easy this
generator<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.550> because<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
generator is to start because it is a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.640 
generator is to start because it is a
good<00:01:04.640> functioning<00:01:05.640> smooth<00:01:06.630> running<00:01:07.080> machine

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
good functioning smooth running machine

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.990 
good functioning smooth running machine
first<00:01:08.189> thing<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
first thing I'm going to do is take the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
first thing I'm going to do is take the
gas<00:01:09.180> cap<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> turn<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> on

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
gas cap I'm going to turn it to the on

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.679 
gas cap I'm going to turn it to the on
position<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> give<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> full<00:01:12.390> choke

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
position I'm going to give it full choke

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.039 
position I'm going to give it full choke
and<00:01:13.100> if<00:01:14.180> we're<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> turn<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> on

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and if we're going to turn it to the on

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
and if we're going to turn it to the on
position<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.549> everything<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> line

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
position and if everything is a line

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
position and if everything is a line
here<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.770> should<00:01:19.950> start<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.180> pull

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.890 

go<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.360> full<00:01:27.570> choke<00:01:32.120> all<00:01:33.120> right<00:01:33.330> what<00:01:33.600> just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
go to full choke all right what just

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.480 
go to full choke all right what just
happened<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.770> had<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:37.080> low<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.280> low

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
happened there was I had the low the low

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
happened there was I had the low the low
throttle<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.450> needs<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> warm<00:01:40.050> up<00:01:40.260> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
throttle which it needs to warm up a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.600 
throttle which it needs to warm up a
little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.650> first<00:01:40.950> we're<00:01:41.190> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.370> do<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
little bit first we're going to do it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.840 
little bit first we're going to do it
again<00:01:41.880> full<00:01:42.180> choke<00:01:42.510> everything's<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.670> can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
again full choke everything's on you can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.320 
again full choke everything's on you can
see

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
see

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.570 
see
the<00:01:51.600> output<00:01:52.160> indicator<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.400> green

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
the output indicator is green

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.270 
the output indicator is green
now<00:01:55.090> if<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.450> want<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.780> save<00:01:56.050> fuel<00:01:56.470> then<00:01:57.130> you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
now if you want to save fuel then you

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.950 
now if you want to save fuel then you
would<00:01:57.400> switch<00:01:57.670> over<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.240> once<00:01:58.510> it's<00:01:58.690> warm

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
would switch over to this once it's warm

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.860 
would switch over to this once it's warm
enough

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
enough

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.170 
enough
brawler<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.770> come<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.670> only<00:02:02.820> pick

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
brawler will come down it will only pick

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.440 
brawler will come down it will only pick
up<00:02:03.330> when<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> need<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.160> it's<00:02:05.160> still<00:02:05.370> cold

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
up when you need it it's still cold
