which<00:00:24.920> seems<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> little<00:00:26.039> backwards<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.730> me<00:00:26.820> but

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
which seems a little backwards to me but

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
which seems a little backwards to me but
that's<00:00:27.300> hot<00:00:27.599> walked<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.710> gonna<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:28.980> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that's hot walked on I'm gonna have to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.990 
that's hot walked on I'm gonna have to
turn<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.630> lock<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> cup<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.189> as

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
turn this lock on the cup there we go as

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
turn this lock on the cup there we go as
you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.420> hear<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.200> suction<00:00:34.620> cups<00:00:34.890> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you can hear it have suction cups to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.729 
you can hear it have suction cups to
hold<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.820> processor<00:00:36.360> onto<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.809> counter<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
hold that processor onto your counter so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
hold that processor onto your counter so
it's<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.010> flying<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.489> around<00:00:38.520> while<00:00:38.910> you're

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it's not flying all around while you're

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's not flying all around while you're
working<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.629> next<00:00:40.559> add<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> blade<00:00:41.850> twice

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
working with it next add the blade twice

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.670 
working with it next add the blade twice
over<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> pose<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.539> there's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> top

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
over the pose and then there's the top

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.729 
over the pose and then there's the top
of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.340> food<00:00:47.969> processing<00:00:48.450> cup<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> get

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the food processing cup see if I get

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.630 
of the food processing cup see if I get
this<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.629> okay<00:00:53.899> no<00:00:55.039> I'll<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this going right okay no I'll get it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.580 
this going right okay no I'll get it
hard<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> backwards<00:00:59.270> there<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.390> go

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
hard to do this backwards there we go

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.660 
hard to do this backwards there we go
now<00:01:01.590> oh<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.680> that's<00:01:04.680> logged<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
now oh all right so that's logged on and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.289 
now oh all right so that's logged on and
then<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> cup<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> locked<00:01:07.380> onto<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.799> base<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
then the cup is locked onto the base in

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
then the cup is locked onto the base in
order<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> food<00:01:10.049> processor<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> run<00:01:11.100> both

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
order for the food processor to run both

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.039 
order for the food processor to run both
of<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:11.760> things<00:01:12.150> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.659> locked<00:01:12.840> in

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
of those things need to be locked in

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.880 
of those things need to be locked in
place<00:01:13.320> otherwise<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.950> won't<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:16.220> also

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
place otherwise it won't start also

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.760 
place otherwise it won't start also
another<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.470> off

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
another way to use this to take that off

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.960 
another way to use this to take that off
and<00:01:23.540> then<00:01:24.540> there's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> stem<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.220> adapter

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and then there's a stem here an adapter

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
and then there's a stem here an adapter
I<00:01:27.000> guess<00:01:27.330> let<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.570> call<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.290> flight<00:01:28.680> onto

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
I guess let me call it that flight onto

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.560 
I guess let me call it that flight onto
that<00:01:29.450> others<00:01:30.450> stem<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> topping

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that others stem and you have a topping

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
that others stem and you have a topping
our<00:01:33.720> grading<00:01:34.049> blade<00:01:34.500> depending<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
our grading blade depending on that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
our grading blade depending on that
topping<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> slicing<00:01:37.229> slicing<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.829> grating

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
topping but a slicing slicing or grating

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.420 
topping but a slicing slicing or grating
so<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.150> side<00:01:39.590> with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> blade<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.189> with

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
so this side with the blade up with

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.870 
so this side with the blade up with
slice<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> swipe<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.610> then

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
slice I'm going to swipe it on and then

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.340 
slice I'm going to swipe it on and then
walk<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.780> top<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.229> again<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:48.049> turn<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
walk your top on again or turn it the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.100 
walk your top on again or turn it the
other<00:01:49.380> way<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> grater<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.280> it

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
other way and you have a grater so it

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
other way and you have a grater so it
kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.250> multifunctional<00:01:56.390> take<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.630> off

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
kind of multifunctional take that off

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.990 
kind of multifunctional take that off
I'll<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> blade<00:01:59.399> back<00:01:59.670> on<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.700> lock

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I'll put the blade back on and I lock

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.109 
I'll put the blade back on and I lock
the<00:02:03.149> top<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.829> again<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.729> go

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the top on again there we go

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.469 
the top on again there we go
now<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.979> an<00:02:08.160> old<00:02:08.310> piece<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.849> Apple<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
now I have an old piece of Apple and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.850 
now I have an old piece of Apple and
stick<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.050> into<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.440> chute<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:12.450> chute<00:02:12.860> pushed

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
stick it into the chute the chute pushed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.790 
stick it into the chute the chute pushed
back<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.390> fruits<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.170> flying<00:02:16.500> all

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
back in so that fruits not flying all

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.220 
back in so that fruits not flying all
over<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.160> plate<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:19.170> will<00:02:19.680> pulp<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.619 

so<00:02:27.069> that's<00:02:27.250> Paul<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.239> just<00:02:28.420> want

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
so that's Paul and then if you just want

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.790 
so that's Paul and then if you just want
to<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.989> on

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.520 

now<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.980> would<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.190> else<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.990> will<00:02:38.200> take<00:02:38.380> the
