00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.410 

every<00:02:01.200> time<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:02.219> back<00:02:02.460> report<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.090> go<00:02:03.210> into

every time you go back report to go into

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
every time you go back report to go into
a<00:02:03.450> different<00:02:03.600> function<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.340> going

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
a different function so now you're going

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.940 
a different function so now you're going
into<00:02:06.109> advance<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.380> they're<00:02:07.499> fine

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.390 

this<00:02:11.490> was<00:02:11.700> forward<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.270> backward

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
this was forward and backward

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:24.059 
this was forward and backward
beep<00:02:14.640> elevator<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.629> down

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.300 

and<00:02:24.459> if<00:02:24.640> they<00:02:24.849> can<00:02:25.000> put<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.269> way<00:02:25.360> down

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
and if they can put it way down

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.010 
and if they can put it way down
to<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.700> some<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.090> five<00:02:28.270> senses<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.840> don't

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
to do some of the five senses I don't

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:39.790 
to do some of the five senses I don't
you<00:02:29.560> don't<00:02:29.739> want<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.099> in<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> air

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.240 

so<00:02:39.950> we're<00:02:40.520> fine

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.980 

and<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.060> also<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.840> your

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
and then you can also do in your

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.870 
and then you can also do in your
secondary

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:03.530 

buttons<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:53.410> will<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.860> federal<00:02:54.790> refined

that's<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.790> Tet<00:05:13.030> indoor<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.780> outdoor<00:05:14.200> so<00:05:14.410> you

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
that's the Tet indoor and outdoor so you

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.980 
that's the Tet indoor and outdoor so you
can<00:05:14.650> kind<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:14.890> control<00:05:15.480> your<00:05:16.480> speed

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
change the hardness on that what else we

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.409 
change the hardness on that what else we
got<00:05:44.960> it's<00:05:45.960> got<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.490> wittmeyer<00:05:47.490> biomechanics

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419
