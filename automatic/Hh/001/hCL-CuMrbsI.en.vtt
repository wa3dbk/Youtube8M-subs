00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
off let's kind of compare the heals so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.770 
off let's kind of compare the heals so
we<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.340> signaler<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> malice<00:01:00.180> over<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.570> I'm

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to be showing you how to use

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to be showing you how to use
withdraw<00:02:04.430> first<00:02:05.430> thing<00:02:05.850> you'll<00:02:06.030> need<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> do

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
withdraw first thing you'll need to do

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
withdraw first thing you'll need to do
is<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.719> into<00:02:06.899> options<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.399> really

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
is go into options now I'm not really

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.190 
is go into options now I'm not really
sure<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.179> makes<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
sure if this makes that much of a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440 
sure if this makes that much of a
difference<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.069> always<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.879> put<00:02:12.060> use

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
difference but I always like to put use

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
difference but I always like to put use
free<00:02:12.780> camera

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
free camera

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.670 
free camera
if<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.390> don't<00:02:14.570> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.410> try<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
if you don't want to you can try it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.260 
if you don't want to you can try it
without<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.550> tell<00:02:16.730> me<00:02:16.790> how<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.060> works

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
without it and just tell me how it works

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.940 
without it and just tell me how it works
but<00:02:18.230> if<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.960> want<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.740> sure

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
but if you really just want to be sure

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.500 
but if you really just want to be sure
that<00:02:21.980> it'll<00:02:22.310> work<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.820> turn<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.180> song<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that it'll work just turn the song it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.280 
that it'll work just turn the song it
doesn't<00:02:23.750> really<00:02:23.840> make<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.080> big<00:02:24.230> difference

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
doesn't really make a big difference

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.680 
doesn't really make a big difference
whatsoever<00:02:25.000> next<00:02:26.000> you'll<00:02:26.210> need<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.390> go<00:02:26.570> into

control options and you see this right

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.240

here about face which is turn your

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.070 
here about face which is turn your
character<00:02:31.630> 180<00:02:32.630> degrees<00:02:33.020> bind<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.240> P

you<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.530> get<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.130> very<00:02:37.880> easily<00:02:38.240> don't<00:02:38.990> but

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
you can get to very easily don't but

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.720 
you can get to very easily don't but
it's<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.590> your<00:02:39.770> zero<00:02:40.130> key<00:02:40.400> or<00:02:40.580> something

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
it's like your zero key or something

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.370 
it's like your zero key or something
because<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.270> you'll<00:02:41.450> be<00:02:41.510> reaching<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
because then you'll be reaching over it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.350 
because then you'll be reaching over it
to<00:02:42.500> heal<00:02:42.740> that's<00:02:43.459> pretty<00:02:43.760> much<00:02:43.910> putting<00:02:44.180> your

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
to heal that's pretty much putting your

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.990 
to heal that's pretty much putting your
heel<00:02:44.600> on<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.170> zero<00:02:45.410> key<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.820> see

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
heel on the zero key like as you can see

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.240 
heel on the zero key like as you can see
here<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.240> have<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:48.620> key<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.130> know

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
here I have it on the one key and I know

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.740 
here I have it on the one key and I know
that's<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.550> lot<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.700> people's<00:02:50.000> Auto<00:02:50.240> Attack<00:02:50.540> key

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's a lot of people's Auto Attack key

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.470 
that's a lot of people's Auto Attack key
but<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.340> my<00:02:52.550> auto<00:02:52.700> attack<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
but I have my auto attack it's just the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.500 
but I have my auto attack it's just the
Q<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.380> pretty<00:02:55.220> much<00:02:55.400> what<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.640> does<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.239> if

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
Q so pretty much what that does is if

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.660 
Q so pretty much what that does is if
you're<00:02:56.630> clicking<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.770> won't<00:02:58.010> work<00:02:58.160> see<00:02:58.489> I'm

right-clicking now I'm left clicking
it's<00:03:00.530> not<00:03:00.739> working<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:01.610> it'll<00:03:01.850> just<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.150> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
it's not working but it'll just do that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.810 
it's not working but it'll just do that
and<00:03:03.970> what<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.180> allows<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.720> do<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.170> run

reason<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.709> second<00:03:55.220> reason<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.700> use<00:03:55.730> this

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
reason the second reason that I use this

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.240 
reason the second reason that I use this
is<00:03:57.730> not<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.450> evade<00:03:59.750> or<00:04:00.110> because<00:04:01.070> it

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
is not for just the evade or because it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.310 
is not for just the evade or because it
pretty<00:04:01.489> much<00:04:01.610> has<00:04:01.670> almost<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.480> same<00:04:02.600> exact

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
pretty much has almost the same exact

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.289 
pretty much has almost the same exact
size<00:04:03.530> heel<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.190> look<00:04:04.730> at<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.940> cool<00:04:05.120> down

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
size heel and look at the cool down

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:05.830 
size heel and look at the cool down
difference

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
difference

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.400 
difference
15<00:04:06.200> seconds<00:04:06.970> 30<00:04:07.970> seconds<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.720> one<00:04:08.900> does<00:04:09.170> give

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
15 seconds 30 seconds this one does give

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.680 
15 seconds 30 seconds this one does give
you<00:04:09.530> regen<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:09.980> stealth<00:04:10.459> but<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.239> one<00:04:11.450> also

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
you regen and stealth but this one also

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.710 
you regen and stealth but this one also
evades<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.530> serves<00:04:12.739> as<00:04:12.950> thumb<00:04:13.280> break<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.329> I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
evades and serves as thumb break so I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.319 
evades and serves as thumb break so I
think<00:04:15.140> this<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.040> but<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.790> better<00:04:17.060> option

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
think this is just but a better option

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.719 
think this is just but a better option
and<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.500> were<00:04:18.680> seeing<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:20.299> little
