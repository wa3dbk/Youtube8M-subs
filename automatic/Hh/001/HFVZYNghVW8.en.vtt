behind the ball to try and turn it late
now<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.170> question<00:00:30.529> becomes<00:00:30.830> what's<00:00:31.789> the<00:00:32.000> best

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
into that position now I've always

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.710 
into that position now I've always
believed<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.160> taught<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.120> best<00:00:38.360> swing

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
believed and taught that the best swing

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.229 
believed and taught that the best swing
is<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:38.989> free<00:00:39.620> swing<00:00:39.979> one<00:00:40.430> that's<00:00:40.640> controlled<00:00:41.120> by

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
is a free swing one that's controlled by

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.390 
is a free swing one that's controlled by
gravity<00:00:41.930> where<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:42.470> simply<00:00:42.890> put<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.250> out<00:00:43.370> here

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
gravity where I simply put it out here

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.149 
gravity where I simply put it out here
and<00:00:43.850> let<00:00:44.000> gravity<00:00:44.150> pull<00:00:44.449> it<00:00:44.750> down<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.350> forward

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
and let gravity pull it down and forward

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.710 
and let gravity pull it down and forward

that camp here's another suggestion for

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.710 
that camp here's another suggestion for
you<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:01.339> swing<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.850> going<00:01:02.180> within<00:01:02.390> a

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
you think of the swing is going within a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.320 
you think of the swing is going within a
four<00:01:03.140> inch<00:01:03.409> corridor<00:01:04.070> all<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.909> way<00:01:05.059> back

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
four inch corridor all the way back

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.840 
four inch corridor all the way back
about<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.960> white<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.159> take<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.610> swing

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
about that white and as I take the swing

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.670 
about that white and as I take the swing
back<00:01:08.090> I'm<00:01:08.360> taking<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.049> outside<00:01:09.650> of

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
back I'm taking it on the outside of

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.010 
back I'm taking it on the outside of
that<00:01:09.860> quarter<00:01:10.400> until<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.570> peak<00:01:11.869> of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
that quarter until I get to the peak of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.749 
that quarter until I get to the peak of
the<00:01:12.109> backswing<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:13.219> I<00:01:13.250> move<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.670> over

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
the backswing then I move it over

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.999 
the backswing then I move it over
slightly<00:01:14.299> to<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.659> inside<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.560> corridor

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
slightly to the inside of that corridor

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.520 
slightly to the inside of that corridor
and<00:01:16.310> bring<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:17.000> forward<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.570> an<00:01:17.719> inside-out

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
and bring it forward on an inside-out

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
and bring it forward on an inside-out
pattern<00:01:19.039> but<00:01:19.520> basically<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.450> same<00:01:20.479> line

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
pattern but basically in the same line

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.010 
pattern but basically in the same line
