we're<00:01:28.280> going<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.550> take<00:01:28.670> my<00:01:28.790> fries

mouses<00:01:42.860> Toews<00:01:43.190> work<00:01:43.369> try<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> enjoy<00:01:44.330> it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.740 

so<00:02:21.370> we're<00:02:21.489> picking<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.879> boost<00:02:22.060> source<00:02:22.390> on

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
so we're picking up the boost source on

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.890 
so we're picking up the boost source on
this<00:02:22.930> car<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.739> very<00:02:24.010> unstable<00:02:24.430> place<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.480> if

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
this car in a very unstable place and if

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.100 
this car in a very unstable place and if
you<00:02:26.019> look<00:02:26.200> at<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.819> log<00:02:27.819> we'll<00:02:28.269> look<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.870> like

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
you look at the log we'll look here like

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.309 
you look at the log we'll look here like
goose<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.250> creeping<00:02:30.700> right<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.170> very

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
goose is creeping right so it's very

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.660 
goose is creeping right so it's very
important<00:02:32.830> where<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.069> actually<00:02:33.220> pull<00:02:33.489> up<00:02:33.580> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
important where you actually pull up the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.009 
important where you actually pull up the
boost<00:02:33.849> source<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:34.599> we'll<00:02:34.780> go<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.959> the

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
boost source because now we'll go to the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.620 
boost source because now we'll go to the
data<00:02:35.260> log<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.760> computer<00:02:36.790> that's<00:02:37.360> actually

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
data log on the computer that's actually

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.500 
data log on the computer that's actually
running<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.959> car

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.990 

you<00:02:43.110> can<00:02:43.260> see<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.920> blue<00:02:44.099> line<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.939> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you can see the blue line here is that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300 
you can see the blue line here is that
steady<00:02:45.540> once<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.900> gets<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.080> certain<00:02:46.349> part<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
steady once it gets a certain part and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.569 
steady once it gets a certain part and
this<00:02:47.430> number<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.450> getting<00:02:48.720> cold<00:02:49.099> and<00:02:50.099> sampled

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
this number is getting cold and sampled

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.420 
this number is getting cold and sampled
it<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.360> right<00:02:51.480> place<00:02:51.689> good<00:02:52.560> solid

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
it just the right place good solid

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.460 
it just the right place good solid
steady<00:02:53.610> signal<00:02:53.939> they<00:02:54.689> gotta<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:54.900> very<00:02:54.959> careful

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
steady signal they gotta be very careful

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.809 
steady signal they gotta be very careful
where<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.890> pull<00:02:56.069> up<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.220> signal<00:02:56.519> because<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
where you pull up the signal because it

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.979 
where you pull up the signal because it
might<00:02:56.939> just<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.180> given<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> wrong<00:02:57.599> info

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
might just be given you the wrong info

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.619 
might just be given you the wrong info
that's<00:02:58.500> straight<00:02:58.769> off<00:02:58.890> ECU<00:02:59.370> I<00:03:02.510> don't<00:03:03.510> think

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that's straight off ECU I don't think

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.259 
that's straight off ECU I don't think
you<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:03.810> more<00:03:03.989> boost<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:06.060> made<00:03:06.239> another

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you need more boost just made another

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.059 
you need more boost just made another
