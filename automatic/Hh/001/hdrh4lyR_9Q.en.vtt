00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
let's say hunting round of the smart

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.889 
let's say hunting round of the smart
fortwo<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.670> why<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.880> city<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.600> very

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
fortwo so this is why it city is a very

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.139 
fortwo so this is why it city is a very
natural<00:02:03.140> let's<00:02:03.740> put<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.159> way<00:02:04.310> term<00:02:04.850> for

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
natural let's put it that way term for

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.630 
natural let's put it that way term for
us<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.509> flame<00:02:06.200> because<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.159> color<00:02:07.399> it's

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
us in flame because of the color it's

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.100 
us in flame because of the color it's
called<00:02:07.909> flame<00:02:08.179> yellow<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> combination

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
called flame yellow so the combination

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.190 
called flame yellow so the combination
of<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> two<00:02:09.890> terms<00:02:10.160> was<00:02:10.459> quite<00:02:10.880> logic<00:02:11.300> thank

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
of the two terms was quite logic thank

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.069 
of the two terms was quite logic thank
