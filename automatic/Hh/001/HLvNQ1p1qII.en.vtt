00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
galaxy s3 that's the quad core version

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
galaxy s3 that's the quad core version
so<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.349> don't<00:00:10.800> know<00:00:10.920> how<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.130> performs<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
so I don't know how it performs on the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509 
so I don't know how it performs on the
American<00:00:12.750> s4<00:00:13.200> version<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.160> go<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
American s4 version but here we go and

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.250 
American s4 version but here we go and
straight<00:00:15.120> away<00:00:15.240> you'll<00:00:15.480> notice<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.049> does

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
straight away you'll notice that it does

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.560 
straight away you'll notice that it does
have<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.740> extra<00:00:17.369> effects<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> menu<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
have the extra effects on the menu so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
have the extra effects on the menu so
that's<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.840> good<00:00:19.020> sign<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.160> also<00:00:20.340> an

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
that's a good sign but it's also an

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.759 
that's a good sign but it's also an
annoying<00:00:20.850> sign<00:00:21.210> because<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.930> my<00:00:22.199> Nexus<00:00:22.590> 4

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
annoying sign because I know my Nexus 4

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.710 
annoying sign because I know my Nexus 4
has<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.980> better<00:00:23.279> GPU<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> doesn't<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
has a better GPU and it doesn't get the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
has a better GPU and it doesn't get the
extra<00:00:24.990> effects<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.830> that's<00:00:26.550> really

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
extra effects so that's really

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
extra effects so that's really
frustrating<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.750> let's<00:00:28.140> go<00:00:28.289> ahead<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.590> just

was<00:00:48.090> saying<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:49.230> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> annoying<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
was saying it's kind of annoying that I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
was saying it's kind of annoying that I
know<00:00:50.160> my<00:00:50.520> Nexus<00:00:50.940> 4<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.360> handle<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.840> extra

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
know my Nexus 4 can handle these extra

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.520 
know my Nexus 4 can handle these extra
effects<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.430> reason<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
effects but for some reason the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
effects but for some reason the
developer<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.340> game<00:00:56.550> has<00:00:56.760> decided<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
developer for this game has decided that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
developer for this game has decided that
it's<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> extra<00:00:58.590> effects

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
it's not going to get the extra effects

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's not going to get the extra effects
so<00:00:59.190> hopefully<00:00:59.579> I'll<00:00:59.699> come<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.059> update

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so hopefully I'll come in and update

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
so hopefully I'll come in and update
yeah<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> mean<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> Galaxy<00:01:01.500> s3<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:02.010> handle

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
yeah I mean if the Galaxy s3 can handle

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
yeah I mean if the Galaxy s3 can handle
it<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> Mallee<00:01:02.820> 400<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:04.290> no<00:01:04.530> doubt

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it with the Mallee 400 I have no doubt

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.940 
it with the Mallee 400 I have no doubt
whatsoever<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.970> Adreno<00:01:06.750> 320<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
whatsoever that the Adreno 320 that is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.450 
whatsoever that the Adreno 320 that is
very<00:01:08.580> powerful<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.270> handle<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.460> yeah

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

the background and the fire is all there

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
the background and the fire is all there
in<00:01:50.220> terms<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.729> smoothness

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
in terms of smoothness

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.510 
in terms of smoothness
it's<00:01:51.600> definitely<00:01:52.290> running<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.950> better<00:01:53.189> than

my Nexus 7 was even on full graphics
it's<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.490> very<00:01:56.820> good<00:01:57.240> performance<00:01:57.600> from

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's actually very good performance from

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.080 
it's actually very good performance from
