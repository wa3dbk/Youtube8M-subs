00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi everyone with you folks supreme whim and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.600
 in today's video I'll show you 4 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.109
 option excellent stemping all 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 time 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.460
 if you're interested let's get down I 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
 good stemping nails should be fine 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.680
 dry out and for the first stemping I 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.800
 take my firm london platinum plate 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
 which is called principle 08 with such 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.430
 very funny and interesting 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.019
 painted with rich white lacquer from Orly 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 I put on the plate 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.220
 I distribute it according to the drawing and print 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220
 drawing on a stamp 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 It turned out such an interesting figure in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.260
 newspaper style and now stamp it on 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.930
 the fingers themselves are now important fluid for 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.680
 removing varnish remove all unnecessary to be 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 neat and here is such a drawing 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 then do the same actions with 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.379
 other drawings are those that I 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.379
 liked it for this manicure 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 very important in stamping use 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 very saturated very bright shades 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.360
 otherwise you just do not print 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.050
 drawing and that's turned out funny 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 manicure on the people for the summer version 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.570
 I chose stemping here such yellow ones 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.110
 funny nails and palette pro also wash 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.540
 landau 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.170
 all the pictures are collected here 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.720
 time 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.119
 I will use peacock print and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 pen and bright purple lacquer 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.259
 very thick not very dull therefore 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 it is almost not visible on the stamp but 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.700
 nevertheless i'm not afraid and imprinted and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.180
 It turned out very pretty even in moderation 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.119
 brightly 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.240
 I do the same thing with the fourth and large 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.729
 fingers such a bright summer manicure 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
 number two 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.660
 the next steamping I could not resist 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 used the christmas palette on 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.950
 in fact, all the palettes or records 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 There is such a film which 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 protects the direct drawing i 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.369
 I chose a picture that repeats 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.860
 sweater and I will use this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.080
 white ornament on red nails will 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.119
 look great on average 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.740
 finger in my sweater with hearts and on 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.740
 the fourth will be such deer 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:20.610
 and where in the winter without snowflakes snowflakes I 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.290
 I'll add on the thumb I know for sure 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.550
 What exactly such a manicure will I have 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 This winter, well, the last record on 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.340
 Today there will be such a record explorer 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.560
 which is very ethnic tunes for their 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 niki i chose dark brown lacquer and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.900
 drawing that repeats drawing 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 mandalas 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.080
 I like very much that this is not complete 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.020
 circle and only half can 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.970
 play as I like for example 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.520
 so the two fingers made 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.590
 full circle and added a little print 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.050
 on thumb for completeness 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.730
 on this and all here are my options for stamping 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.230
 if you like it put your fingers 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.890
 up and see you in the following videos 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.890
