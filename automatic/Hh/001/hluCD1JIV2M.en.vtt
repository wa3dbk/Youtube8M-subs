you<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.210> how<00:00:48.359> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.839> i<00:00:49.109> can<00:00:49.890> actually

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you right now how you can i can actually

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.069 
you right now how you can i can actually
move<00:00:50.429> this<00:00:50.609> around<00:00:50.819> so<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.629> feature

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
move this around so that's one feature

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
move this around so that's one feature
you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.350> pull<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.679> down<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.030> show

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you can pull it down and it will show

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.380 
you can pull it down and it will show
you<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.569> can<00:00:54.600> make<00:00:55.109> it<00:00:55.229> smaller<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:57.210> can

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you you can make it smaller and you can

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750 
you you can make it smaller and you can
actually<00:00:57.539> unpin<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> uninstall<00:00:59.159> that<00:00:59.370> way<00:00:59.550> as

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
actually unpin and uninstall that way as

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.329 
actually unpin and uninstall that way as
well<00:01:00.139> we<00:01:01.139> have<00:01:01.409> not<00:01:01.649> figured<00:01:01.889> out<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
well we have not figured out how to

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.249 
well we have not figured out how to
actually<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.179> that<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.569> just<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
actually back out of that so just to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.410 
actually back out of that so just to
show<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:04.829> to<00:01:05.369> move<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> again<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:06.329> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
show you how to move this again so you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
show you how to move this again so you
can<00:01:06.479> suppose<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.469> able<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> bring<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> up

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
can suppose to be able to bring it up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
can suppose to be able to bring it up
but<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.270> sticky<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.170> do

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
but it's they're really sticky and do

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
but it's they're really sticky and do
not<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> separate<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.909> their<00:01:12.060> friends

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not like to separate from their friends

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.350 
not like to separate from their friends
but<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.259> can<00:01:13.649> move<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.579> you<00:01:15.210> can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
but you can move it that way you can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
but you can move it that way you can
also<00:01:15.420> move<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:16.079> up<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.469> then<00:01:16.860> use<00:01:17.130> another

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
also move it up and then use another

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.510 
also move it up and then use another
finger<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.090> pan<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:18.719> is<00:01:18.899> sort<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> cool<00:01:19.520> but

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
finger to pan which is sort of cool but

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.069 
finger to pan which is sort of cool but
yeah<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.000> saying<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.719> like<00:01:21.899> to

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
yeah like I'm saying they really like to

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.109 
yeah like I'm saying they really like to
stick<00:01:22.649> together<00:01:22.829> but<00:01:23.579> eventually<00:01:23.789> you'll

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
stick together but eventually you'll

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
stick together but eventually you'll
actually<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.479> able<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.719> zoom<00:01:24.990> out<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> you'll

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
actually be able to zoom out and you'll

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually be able to zoom out and you'll
be<00:01:26.070> able<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> organize<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.939> by<00:01:26.969> different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
be able to organize them by different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.999 
be able to organize them by different
categories<00:01:28.170> though<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.619> working

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
categories though that's not working

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
categories though that's not working
right<00:01:29.340> now<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.420> other<00:01:30.990> things<00:01:31.289> to<00:01:31.469> sort<00:01:31.649> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
right now so other things to sort of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
right now so other things to sort of
show<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.219> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.840> jumping<00:01:33.840> back<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
show you is a jumping back to the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
show you is a jumping back to the
desktop<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:35.070> obviously<00:01:35.399> they<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.939> not<00:01:36.149> cut

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
desktop and obviously they have not cut

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
desktop and obviously they have not cut

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
another app here I can snap that so that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.960 
another app here I can snap that so that
works<00:02:42.590> pretty<00:02:42.770> well<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
works pretty well and I really like the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.090 
works pretty well and I really like the
ability<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.450> resize<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:45.650> that's<00:02:45.830> pretty

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
ability to resize think that's pretty

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.070 
ability to resize think that's pretty
cool<00:02:46.310> obviously<00:02:46.970> that's<00:02:47.630> not<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.020> be

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
cool obviously that's not going to be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.790 
cool obviously that's not going to be
ideal<00:02:48.440> for<00:02:48.760> reading<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.880> website<00:02:50.330> but<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.650> can

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
ideal for reading a website but you can

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.190 
ideal for reading a website but you can
see<00:02:52.070> that<00:02:52.520> as<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.820> pull<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.270> should<00:02:53.990> be<00:02:54.110> able

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
see that as you pull in should be able

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.930 
see that as you pull in should be able
to<00:02:54.350> pull<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.620> another<00:02:54.890> app<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.310> snap<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:55.580> there

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
to pull in another app and snap it there

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.180 
to pull in another app and snap it there
so<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.870> works<00:02:57.050> really<00:02:57.290> well<00:02:57.650> it's<00:02:58.010> one<00:02:58.160> of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
so that works really well it's one of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.680 
so that works really well it's one of
the<00:02:58.370> things<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.670> they<00:02:58.850> seem<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.120> have<00:02:59.360> worked

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the things that they seem to have worked

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.410 
the things that they seem to have worked
pretty<00:03:00.230> hard<00:03:00.350> on<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.770> seems<00:03:01.010> really<00:03:01.790> stable<00:03:02.270> at

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
pretty hard on it seems really stable at

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.420 
pretty hard on it seems really stable at
this<00:03:02.630> point<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.170> then<00:03:03.530> just<00:03:03.680> getting<00:03:03.950> back<00:03:04.100> to
