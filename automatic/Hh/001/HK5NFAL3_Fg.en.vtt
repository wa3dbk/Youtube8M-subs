00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.160
 ah 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.620
 very good to all friends of trash rooms 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.049
 and welcome to the esperium after 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.350
 a few days of break and let's go with the letter 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.510
 h 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.460
 a quite difficult letter to treat is 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.080
 a letter rich in content has 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.820
 a lot of different video games in 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400
 Japan especially there is where more 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.199
 games with hache came out a lot what 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.759
 bad thing about this is that most of the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.499
 games that came out there by this letter 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.380
 they are unplayable for us are games 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.870
 very difficult are games that continue 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.640
 very Japanese rules some games 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.989
 they are even adventures 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 conversational others are something else 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.860
 sports since we can play better 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.450
 but there are others that do not directly 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.340
 they understand we can not know the purpose 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.200
 of those games because directly the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.610
 language is a barrier so let's 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.230
 pull some games a little more 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.240
 typical this time I'm going to take that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070
 license since the letter h as I say is 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.600
 very difficult and at least with games a 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.760
 little known is easier 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.679
 recommend games we go there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.449
 the first game that we are going to try is 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.530
 well known but rope 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.390
 transmission and pretty history 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.040
 interesting we are talking about high 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.509
 person shooter up in three view 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.250
 dimensions but that we also 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.229
 remember efe 0 because sometimes it seems a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.299
 racing game though if you are not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.340
 an action game does not use a 7 mode 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.330
 quite showy and look for the game 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.460
 a 3d 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.530
 rudimentary that is pretty good before 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.509
 to develop the fx chip this game already 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 demonstrated the capabilities of nintendo to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.259
 the time to show tv well this game 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.789
 is created by hal laboratories la 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.020
 company that was behind Kirby's 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.819
 smash bros and other big franchises 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 of today but when they did 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.450
 this game in 91 they are still there 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.770
 some free cir party still made 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 video games for the computers of the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 time for example for commodore friend and 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.679
 more systems in fact this game is 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.929
 inspired in part by 8-bit games 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.280
 I also did not have a 3D function 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.630
 stereoscopic that was not included in the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.880
 final is to say the game may have been 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 seen in three of a special glasses and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 well -ha laboratories went bankrupt 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.289
 just that year and the following year 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.420
 was absorbed by nintendo and there it is 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.860
 where the apogee of the study and of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.060
 there came out many personalities that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.060
 nowadays they are in the top management 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.570
 Supernintendo watched great sagas 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.270
 that have continued to last over time and 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.040
 one of them exists is harvest moon whose 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.020
 first delivery appeared already in a time 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.330
 late in super nintendo and therefore not 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.520
 enjoyed much success harvest moon is a 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.650
 rpg but that more than reflects is a 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.150
 life simulator pretends to make us 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.040
 manage some resources to be able to 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
 move forward and also has a social part 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.750
 of talking to inhabitants and also a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.590
 part of construction or of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.090
 redistribution of resources that is a 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.440
 game that has it all is a game that 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.050
 it seems a rpg is actually a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.580
 simulator does not come harvest world is not 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.470
 exclusive of nintendo heart same one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.120
 stopped more deliveries in other consoles 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.209
 for example in a console of sony has 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.490
 had some title there and the harvest 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.709
 moon is a saga that has inspired that 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.709
 famous facebook farmville those games 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.959
 almost generic we can say have been born 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.880
 of games like this one not so harvest 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.560
 moon has left such a gigantic legacy 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.160
 that you can be imagining until 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 where it reaches 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.700
 the third game today could be 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 call as a sleeper or asleep or 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.290
 that was there had in the catalog but 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.900
 not many people knew him it's not about 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.320
 kagan is a game that is very much like 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.490
 games like strider or so I did not see 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.890
 great proposals that he had arrive 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.810
 many users who were looking for games 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.550
 action of that type were going to mega drive 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.290
 for it but to which super nintendo 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.080
 we also had similar games and just 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.030
 the most similar to shinobi or strider that 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.700
 we have or that we had outside win a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.380
 incredible game may be the one of those 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.850
 games that graphically do not call 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.010
 a lot of attention or they could be 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.720
 more polished for cancer but 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
 musically playable is very well 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.040
 meets a game that has a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.170
 themed arcade totally pure action and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.230
 tough hard is a pretty game 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.210
 difficult and has many hours like this behind 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.070
 of the game until I do not until 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.180
 let's dominate and we can pass it without a doubt 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.680
 some so it's an action game 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.450
 complete and difficult 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.710
 Kagan is one of the best proposals that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.710
 they existed in super nintendo 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.790
 the letter h had several titles 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.250
 sports among them golf games 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.370
 soccer games but there was also a 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.650
 pretty good volleyball game we're 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.840
 talking here about hyper alive that is a 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.799
 volleyball game in two dimensions is 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.090
 say in games side view events 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.790
 that is, they have very good graphics 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.169
 the ball moves very fluid and the 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.699
 animations of the characters of the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.680
 equipment is excellent is a game 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.449
 frantic but that also leaves us 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 think what the next move will be 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.620
 they do not have their strategy they could flood 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.020
 cpu and if we get bored of beating the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.729
 cpu or losing against her as we can 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.450
 play a game with a friend who 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.450
 it always comes in handy 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.790
 well and as a last game I will include 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.440
 one of kirk since the letter h since the 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.080
 letter k I want to include another one of it 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.539
 saga and I do not want them to overlap the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.139
 same saga in the same letter so the 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.759
 h 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.160
 We will include the original the genuine 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.889
 hoshino kirby 3 so it was called here go 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.500
 ok japan it's about kirby dreamland 3 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.150
 for those who do not sound the name and is 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.370
 one of the last platforms that came out 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.560
 its allowed with this super technique 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.330
 drawn that seems made when by 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.759
 A child's colored pencils have a 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.260
 Awesome graphic aspect and the game 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.000
 itself is very good I do not think it's the 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.130
 Best of each series of inland 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.870
 he has his favorite but in short he is a 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.910
 game that was less successful maybe 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.650
 less recognition than we want 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.120
 of elanco from the game boy and they were 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.440
 much more known this team and if 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.990
 keep the line includes new 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.669
 pets somewhat longer and 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.440
 a game is also quite challenging 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.539
 which is quite fun and access to 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.520
 100% have their thing these or that is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.520
 difficult to do in full 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.710
 and very well as you see this list h ha 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.690
 had a lot of known games but 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.310
 is that most games of this 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.790
 letter as I said at the beginning are 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.620
 playable down a rom set with games 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.300
 of super nintendo of super famicom and go 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.920
 testing games the letter h you will see that the 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.530
 most you will not understand the eyes 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.060
 who need to know Japanese to be able 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.920
 understand even from which side also 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.950
 there is a lot repeats in this letter that is 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.910
 very difficult to understand being in Japanese 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.890
 practically if they lose the desire still 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.330
 so I hope you take note of these 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.280
 games sure that many of you already know 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.410
 it's ready, all of us will sound 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.140
 we said here and nothing in the letter and 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.790
 so more games and we would see each other 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.050
 soon in that letter a strong hug 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.160
 and thanks for watching the friends video 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.160
 happy Holidays to all
