and this is a

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.890 
and this is a
this<00:03:32.310> Center<00:03:32.610> intersection<00:03:33.330> right<00:03:33.360> here<00:03:33.750> is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
this Center intersection right here is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.020 
this Center intersection right here is
what<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.440> believe<00:03:34.650> what<00:03:35.130> they<00:03:35.220> call<00:03:35.430> Spaghetti

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
what I believe what they call Spaghetti

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.970 
what I believe what they call Spaghetti
Junction

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.259 

years<00:03:39.610> ago<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.360> was<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.659> real<00:03:41.230> bottleneck<00:03:42.269> of

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
years ago this was a real bottleneck of

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.330 
years ago this was a real bottleneck of
an<00:03:43.420> intersection<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:45.069> they<00:03:45.220> had<00:03:45.400> really

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
an intersection and so they had really

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.330 
an intersection and so they had really
build<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.180> these<00:03:48.390> bridges<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.349> you<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.160> see

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
build all these bridges and you can see

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.830 
build all these bridges and you can see
probably<00:03:50.610> why<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.150> called<00:03:51.330> Spaghetti

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
probably why it's called Spaghetti

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.440 
probably why it's called Spaghetti
Junction<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.830> can

Junction if I can

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.800 
Junction if I can
get<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.110> ain't<00:03:55.290> right<00:03:55.650> at<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.160> bridges<00:03:57.030> but

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
get it ain't right at the bridges but

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.500 
get it ain't right at the bridges but
they<00:03:58.110> built<00:03:58.319> all<00:03:58.500> those<00:03:58.680> bridges<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.940> order<00:04:00.300> to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
they built all those bridges in order to

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.090 
they built all those bridges in order to
sort<00:04:00.810> of<00:04:00.930> give<00:04:01.650> extra<00:04:02.269> capacity<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
sort of give extra capacity to the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.730 
sort of give extra capacity to the

my paperwork taken care of and dealing

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.720 
my paperwork taken care of and dealing
with<00:05:22.090> had<00:05:22.539> deals<00:05:23.289> along<00:05:23.710> for<00:05:23.889> a<00:05:23.919> little<00:05:24.099> bit
