frames per second 1080p video now I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.189 
frames per second 1080p video now I
don't<00:00:27.359> know<00:00:27.510> if<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> make<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> video

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
don't know if going to make this video

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.220 
don't know if going to make this video
1080p<00:00:29.630> accessible<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.109> keep

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
1080p accessible or if it's gonna keep

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.049 
1080p accessible or if it's gonna keep
it<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.439> 720p<00:00:32.009> because<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:32.489> opinion<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
it at 720p because my opinion really

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.250 
it at 720p because my opinion really
doesn't<00:00:33.270> make<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.690> much<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.230> difference

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
doesn't make that much of a difference

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.319 
doesn't make that much of a difference
to<00:00:35.070> where<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.460> oh<00:00:35.610> my<00:00:35.760> god<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
to where it's like oh my god this is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
to where it's like oh my god this is
what<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> watch<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> am<00:00:38.790> fine<00:00:39.090> with

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
what I have to watch so I am fine with

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
what I have to watch so I am fine with
the<00:00:39.629> 720p<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.739> allows<00:00:41.040> me<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.670> 60

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the 720p if it allows me to do it at 60

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
the 720p if it allows me to do it at 60
frames<00:00:41.969> per<00:00:42.210> second<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.719> able<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> find<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
frames per second if I'm able to find it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
frames per second if I'm able to find it
I<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.860> sure<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> 1080p

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I know for sure I could do a 1080p

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
I know for sure I could do a 1080p
that's<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> did<00:00:45.570> last<00:00:45.660> night<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that's what I did last night not a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
that's what I did last night not a
problem<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> no<00:00:47.340> any<00:00:47.460> difference<00:00:47.820> i

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
problem with it no any difference i

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
problem with it no any difference i
guess<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> between<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> two<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
guess there is between the two is that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
guess there is between the two is that
significantly<00:00:50.850> significantly<00:00:51.559> longer

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
significantly significantly longer

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
significantly significantly longer
excuse<00:00:52.949> me<00:00:53.129> wars<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.030> tied<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.629> big

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
excuse me wars got all tied up my big

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
excuse me wars got all tied up my big
ass<00:00:54.930> lips<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> comes<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> rendering

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
ass lips and when it comes to rendering

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.990 
ass lips and when it comes to rendering
the<00:00:57.420> video<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:57.899> prior<00:00:58.460> then<00:00:59.460> 30<00:00:59.760> frames

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the video out then prior then 30 frames

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.229 
the video out then prior then 30 frames
per<00:01:00.120> second<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.739> 720p<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.100> i<00:01:02.309> guess<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> three

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
per second and 720p so i guess a three

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
per second and 720p so i guess a three
and<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> half<00:01:03.390> mini<00:01:03.660> minute<00:01:04.229> video<00:01:04.439> took<00:01:04.530> me

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and a half mini minute video took me

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.910 
and a half mini minute video took me
right<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.220> an<00:01:05.670> hour<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.720> render<00:01:07.260> when

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
right around an hour to render when

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
right around an hour to render when
typically<00:01:08.520> only<00:01:08.729> takes<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.119> 15<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> 20

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
typically only takes about 15 to 20

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.890 
typically only takes about 15 to 20
minutes<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.180> obviously<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.689> takes

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
minutes to do so so obviously it takes

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
minutes to do so so obviously it takes
it's<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.560> effort<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's gonna take more effort and more I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's gonna take more effort and more I
guess<00:01:15.950> drive<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.310> me<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
guess drive for me to do that which I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.179 
guess drive for me to do that which I
don't<00:01:19.020> mind<00:01:19.170> doing<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.680> i'm<00:01:19.830> really<00:01:20.070> not

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
don't mind doing because i'm really not

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.830 
don't mind doing because i'm really not
popping<00:01:20.580> videos<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.119> i<00:01:21.240> used<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.600> mean

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
popping videos not like i used to i mean

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.240 
popping videos not like i used to i mean
every<00:01:22.080> other<00:01:22.229> day<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> basically<00:01:23.040> where<00:01:23.130> i'm

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
every other day is basically where i'm

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.679 
every other day is basically where i'm
at<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.030> live<00:01:24.270> streams<00:01:24.540> here

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
at right now I'm going live streams here

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
at right now I'm going live streams here
and<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.110> uh<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.970> think

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and there but uh you know I don't think

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
and there but uh you know I don't think
that's<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.140> doable<00:01:28.290> though<00:01:28.500> right

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that's I think it's doable though right

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.170 
that's I think it's doable though right
you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.490> pretty<00:01:29.700> sure<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> guys<00:01:30.000> are

you know I'm pretty sure you guys are
going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> enjoy<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.650> 60<00:01:32.369> frames<00:01:32.610> per<00:01:32.700> second

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
going to enjoy the 60 frames per second

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.830 
going to enjoy the 60 frames per second
because<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.329> definitely<00:01:33.509> tell<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
because you can definitely tell a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.690 
because you can definitely tell a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
game enough to really care too much

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.750 
game enough to really care too much
about<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:06.750> they<00:03:06.989> do<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.319> their<00:03:07.440> game<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.519> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
about what they do to their game but on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.030 
about what they do to their game but on
the<00:03:08.880> outside<00:03:08.910> looking<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.630> which<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.959> am<00:03:10.200> for<00:03:10.950> me

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the outside looking in which I am for me

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.199 
the outside looking in which I am for me
it's<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> good<00:03:11.519> look<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:12.000> them<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it's just not a good look for them I

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.150 
it's just not a good look for them I
think<00:03:12.239> they<00:03:12.450> made<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> too<00:03:12.930> expensive<00:03:13.440> you

think they made it too expensive you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.460 
think they made it too expensive you
know<00:03:14.609> it's<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.910> dollar<00:03:15.090> 99<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.140> able<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.350> buy

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
know it's a dollar 99 to be able to buy

Supply Drop and it's not a guarantee I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.970 
Supply Drop and it's not a guarantee I
mean<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.959> might<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:19.230> some<00:03:19.350> fucking<00:03:19.680> gloves

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
mean you might get some fucking gloves

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.080 
mean you might get some fucking gloves
out<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.579> don't<00:03:20.730> even<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:20.940> they

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
out of it and I don't even think they

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.160 
out of it and I don't even think they
could<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.359> lead<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:21.750> something<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.079> I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
could be a lead or something like that I

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.449 
could be a lead or something like that I
think<00:03:22.380> it'd<00:03:22.440> just<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.680> regular<00:03:22.890> gloves<00:03:23.310> or

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
think it'd just be regular gloves or

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.520 
think it'd just be regular gloves or
whatever<00:03:23.810> professional<00:03:24.810> gloves<00:03:25.049> or<00:03:25.260> whatever

whatever professional gloves or whatever

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.319 
whatever professional gloves or whatever

something that you can just play the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
would feel better about Lyle cages by

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.530

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
the gun you know that that would be

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.059 
the gun you know that that would be
better<00:04:03.780> but<00:04:04.019> if<00:04:04.440> they're<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.799> take<00:04:04.920> your

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069

money and not guarantee you anything
that<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.600> seems<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.900> little<00:04:06.930> shady<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.530> me<00:04:07.620> it

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
that just seems a little shady to me it

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.620 
that just seems a little shady to me it
doesn't<00:04:07.920> look<00:04:08.100> good<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.549> them<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.480> they<00:04:09.600> have

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
doesn't look good on them that they have

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.940 
doesn't look good on them that they have
to<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.290> also<00:04:10.440> makes<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.769> look<00:04:10.829> like

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
to do that and also makes it look like

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.440 
to do that and also makes it look like
obviously<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.730> game's<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:12.030> going<00:04:12.269> as<00:04:12.359> well

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
obviously the game's not going as well

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.789 
obviously the game's not going as well
as<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.629> thought<00:04:12.659> it<00:04:12.930> would<00:04:12.959> they're<00:04:13.680> going

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
as I thought it would they're going

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.229 
as I thought it would they're going
anything<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.459> everything<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.790> save<00:04:15.060> their

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
anything and everything to save their

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.509 
anything and everything to save their
ass<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:16.470> add<00:04:16.739> again<00:04:16.979> on<00:04:17.130> outside

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
ass and just add again on outside

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:17.879 
ass and just add again on outside
