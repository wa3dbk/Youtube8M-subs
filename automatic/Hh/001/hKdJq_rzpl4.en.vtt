exposed this it's really easy to see the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
exposed this it's really easy to see the
width<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.630> pith<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
width of the pith and then we want to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.179 
width of the pith and then we want to
try<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.090> around<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.570> slice<00:01:25.189> following

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
try and go around and slice following

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240 
try and go around and slice following
the<00:01:26.520> white<00:01:26.759> line<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.840> piss<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.860> doesn't<00:01:29.159> need

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the white line the piss it doesn't need

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
the white line the piss it doesn't need
to<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> perfect<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.360> miss<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to be perfect if we miss some of the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
to be perfect if we miss some of the
stuff<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.369> through<00:01:32.670> later<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
stuff we can go back through later and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.039 
stuff we can go back through later and
trim<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> try<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
trim it again but you do want to try and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.910 
trim it again but you do want to try and
get<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> follow<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.700> line<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.570> curve<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
get the follow the line the curve of the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.179 
get the follow the line the curve of the
grapefruit<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.700> keep<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> round<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> want

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
grapefruit to keep it round and you want

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.480 
grapefruit to keep it round and you want
to<00:01:44.280> try<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.700> slice<00:01:45.799> all<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> white<00:01:47.340> stuff

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to try and slice all of the white stuff

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.060 
to try and slice all of the white stuff
off<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.240> pits

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
off all of the pits

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.120 
off all of the pits
so<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.030> I've<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.840> much<00:01:52.130> cleared

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so you can see I've pretty much cleared

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.460 
so you can see I've pretty much cleared
away<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.780> there's<00:01:54.960> still<00:01:55.110> some

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
away a lot of it but there's still some

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.680 
away a lot of it but there's still some
white<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.580> can<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.880> take<00:01:57.120> our<00:01:57.270> knife<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
white so we can just take our knife and

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.380 
white so we can just take our knife and
just<00:01:58.110> lightly<00:01:58.710> basically<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> scrape<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
just lightly basically just scrape that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.650 
just lightly basically just scrape that
off<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.620> deep<00:02:01.830> enough<00:02:02.010> so<00:02:02.660> that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
off you want to get deep enough so that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.520 
off you want to get deep enough so that
exposes<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.530> membranes<00:02:05.780> now<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.440> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
exposes the membranes now I want to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.560 
exposes the membranes now I want to
release<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.130> segment's<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.479> do

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.810 
release the segment's what I like to do
is<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> hold<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.320> my<00:02:10.410> hand<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.950> each

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
is to hold it in my hand and each

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.270 
is to hold it in my hand and each
segment<00:02:12.300> has<00:02:12.840> two<00:02:13.260> sides<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.860> I'm<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
