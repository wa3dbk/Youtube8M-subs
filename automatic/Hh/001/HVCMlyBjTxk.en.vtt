00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.139 
own PC and you can see I've installed
the<00:01:47.729> toolbar<00:01:48.329> right<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.939> I<00:01:50.939> think

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the toolbar right here and I think

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.990

that's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that's a good thing to do because it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.830 
that's a good thing to do because it
makes<00:01:54.210> using<00:01:54.509> stumble<00:01:54.990> upon<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.680> easier

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
websites that I've never seen before

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.230 
websites that I've never seen before
that<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.289> can<00:05:54.560> talk<00:05:54.800> about<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.370> do<00:05:56.120> little

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
that I can talk about and do little

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.120 
that I can talk about and do little
research<00:05:56.539> on<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:56.990> recommend<00:05:57.409> to<00:05:57.650> my<00:05:57.770> readers

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
research on and recommend to my readers

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.089 
research on and recommend to my readers
so<00:05:58.760> that<00:05:59.090> gives<00:05:59.720> you<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.810> really<00:06:00.169> good<00:06:00.409> idea<00:06:00.860> of

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
so that gives you a really good idea of

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.950 
so that gives you a really good idea of
how<00:06:01.520> do<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:01.669> stumble<00:06:02.210> upon<00:06:02.270> two<00:06:02.659> different

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
how do you stumble upon two different

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.960 
how do you stumble upon two different
ways<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.320> recommend<00:06:03.979> putting<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.280> toolbar<00:06:04.789> on

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
ways I recommend putting the toolbar on

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.899 
ways I recommend putting the toolbar on
because<00:06:05.389> it<00:06:05.659> makes<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.199> lot<00:06:06.349> easier<00:06:06.800> for<00:06:06.979> you

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
because it makes it a lot easier for you

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.320 
because it makes it a lot easier for you
to<00:06:08.060> simply<00:06:08.800> hit<00:06:09.800> one<00:06:10.010> button<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.400> find<00:06:10.940> sites

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
to simply hit one button and find sites

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.659 
to simply hit one button and find sites
that<00:06:11.780> matter<00:06:12.020> now<00:06:12.560> if<00:06:12.800> you're<00:06:13.010> a<00:06:13.039> good<00:06:13.250> stumble
