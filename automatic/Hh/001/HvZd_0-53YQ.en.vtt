so willing to be plain one whole time
here<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.110> minor<00:02:54.430> another<00:02:55.430> one<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.790> D<00:02:56.350> will

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
here in a minor another one in D will

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.190 
here in a minor another one in D will
repeat<00:02:57.650> another<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.490> D<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.350> we<00:03:00.350> change<00:03:01.070> to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
repeat another one in D and we change to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.560 
repeat another one in D and we change to
eat<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:03.500> more<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.920> okay<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:05.210> exercise

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
eat one more time okay so the exercise

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:14.510 
eat one more time okay so the exercise
going<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.050> way

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.060 

and<00:03:14.880> another<00:03:15.360> thing<00:03:15.780> very<00:03:15.990> important<00:03:16.860> here

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
and another thing very important here

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.890 
and another thing very important here
and<00:03:17.190> useful<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> Latin<00:03:18.150> piano<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.510> when

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and useful in the Latin piano is when

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.110 
and useful in the Latin piano is when
you're<00:03:19.080> changing<00:03:19.320> one<00:03:19.740> node<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.550> another<00:03:20.580> node

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
you're changing one node to another node

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.240 
you're changing one node to another node
in<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.570> whole<00:03:21.750> note<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.470> use<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.740> semitone

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
in a whole note you can use the semitone

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
in a whole note you can use the semitone
between<00:03:23.580> both<00:03:24.030> nodes<00:03:24.770> okay

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
between both nodes okay

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
between both nodes okay
this<00:03:26.250> example<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.360> when<00:03:27.540> we

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
this example is going to be here when we

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.650 
this example is going to be here when we
change<00:03:27.990> from<00:03:28.170> E<00:03:28.350> minor<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:29.010> D<00:03:29.550> we<00:03:30.270> are<00:03:30.330> going<00:03:30.540> to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
change from E minor to D we are going to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.850 
change from E minor to D we are going to
use<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.470> e<00:03:31.680> flat<00:03:32.130> note<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:33.090> get<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.930> e<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> D

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
use the e flat note to get from e to D

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.080 
use the e flat note to get from e to D
this<00:03:35.310> way

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.140 

and<00:03:42.510> again<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.380> get<00:03:43.670> from<00:03:44.670> thee<00:03:44.870> from<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.260> e

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and again to get from thee from the to e

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:58.540 
and again to get from thee from the to e
user<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.450> flat<00:03:48.780> okay<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.290> way

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.520 

okay<00:03:59.550> another<00:03:59.910> thing<00:04:00.210> you<00:04:00.330> can<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.960> use<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
okay another thing you can do is use the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.640 
okay another thing you can do is use the
Armani's<00:04:02.130> with<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.330> play<00:04:03.870> both<00:04:04.200> notes<00:04:04.230> at<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
Armani's with a play both notes at the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:13.970 
Armani's with a play both notes at the
same<00:04:04.890> time

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.979 

or<00:04:14.980> also<00:04:15.370> make<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.000> variation<00:04:16.540> between<00:04:16.660> both

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
or also make a variation between both

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.890 
or also make a variation between both
examples

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.020 

and<00:04:26.900> another<00:04:27.530> variation<00:04:28.160> we<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.310> use<00:04:28.610> here<00:04:28.850> is

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and another variation we can use here is

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.700 
and another variation we can use here is
to<00:04:29.240> play<00:04:29.390> several<00:04:29.810> times<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.170> sign<00:04:30.380> out<00:04:30.530> this

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
to play several times the sign out this

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.020 
to play several times the sign out this
way

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:45.400 

this<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.990> little<00:04:36.410> bit<00:04:36.620> harder<00:04:36.980> okay<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.430> play

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410
