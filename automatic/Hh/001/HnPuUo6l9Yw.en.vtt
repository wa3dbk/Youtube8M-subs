 hi hello kim jong and good after 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.260
 upload the previous video and review 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.090
 twitter I found something that I 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.690
 he was surprised I said or if there 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.670
 I wait a little more just a little more and I 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.380
 I found this image that rose shots 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.529
 or says hey hey there's a screenshot here 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.659
 good I have a catch a screenshot of 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.649
 screen and we see in this screenshot of 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:33.500
 good screen I see haze and you see the 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.210
 little pigs I think that change that from your 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.670
 nose 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.329
 it's like 3-d 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.539
 and the most interesting thing is if we put 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.180
 here to zoom not the butt of 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.760
 steve no 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.000
 and what we have around here is a normal 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.820
 in a problem 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.250
 and the most interesting are these two 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.790
 last objects that you have down here do not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.750
 his head not because he moved 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.140
 are these two parts the last objects 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 are the stelae iron bars and what 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 more interesting the most amazing thing is this 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.790
 wool rug this had barely been 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.720
 I do not know is amazing it had barely been 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.570
 updated in the version for pc that is 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 1.6 points 2 and here you are already putting it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.590
 at 8 at 0.8 point zero apparently 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.240
 which is amazing me too 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 I always said today I wish that also only 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.720
 put it in minecraft and it looks like it's going to 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 be reality 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.630
 here we have it is obvious is not from I do not think 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.750
 that is nothing else is enough 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 obvious that it is a carpet in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.460
 minecraft and for 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 in the version rather 0.8 point 0 what 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.440
 which is great and is deciding now yes 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.729
 that is news of last increase I hope 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.050
