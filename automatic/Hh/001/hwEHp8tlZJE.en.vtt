00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.940
 to the time throwing over the moments 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.580
 we spent together closing our eyes 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.890
 looking at a deep past opening the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.870
 and continue in the world dying slow 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.120

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.880
 not perfect since my values ​​are in 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.160

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.230

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.600
 it will be the pages not your fingers who 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.460
 dry my tears I do not know if to say that I 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.200

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.720
 insomnia live the inhospitable out of the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.330
 vital trying to avoid your lips and your 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.430

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.990
 step of putting a price on what shone 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.000
 Today, I peppered me with blaming what I did not 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.370
 I did to close scars and open 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.470
 doors that close in my noses cat 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.690

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.940
 many things with heels but for those 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.040
 there are no stories no if I do not lie today 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.910
 It costs more to find the mother for your 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.010
 children 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.260

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.610
 incognito looking for you even if you do not 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.980

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.170
 with his mouth stitched but talking 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.450
 eyes signing my life sentence 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.850
 even if it destroys me by leaving my skin on 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.650
 the asphalt for touching yours though each 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.900

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.990
 reasons to smile every morning I follow 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.970
 being reserved and I can not stand 14 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.920
