I<00:01:01.050> was<00:01:01.379> skeptical<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.370> another<00:01:02.940> crossover

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the market for example in Poland we just

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.610 
the market for example in Poland we just
get<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.200> 1.6<00:03:41.920> petrol<00:03:42.630> manual<00:03:43.630> for<00:03:43.840> now<00:03:43.990> one

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
get the 1.6 petrol manual for now one

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.550 
get the 1.6 petrol manual for now one
day<00:03:44.860> we<00:03:45.130> will<00:03:45.280> get<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> automatic<00:03:46.320> under<00:03:47.320> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
day we will get the automatic under the

get used to good stuff and it could

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.020 
get used to good stuff and it could
really<00:05:28.289> use<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.680> on<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.919> motorway<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.490> really

really could use a 6th gear

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.839 
really could use a 6th gear
speaking<00:05:33.690> of<00:05:33.810> gears<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.259> gearbox<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:35.039> nice

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
speaking of gears the gearbox is nice

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.100 
speaking of gears the gearbox is nice
and<00:05:36.090> light<00:05:36.240> nice<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.810> easy

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
and light nice and easy

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.830 
and light nice and easy
but<00:05:37.620> then<00:05:37.740> again<00:05:38.009> Suzuki's<00:05:38.849> had<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.240> similar

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
but then again Suzuki's had a similar

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.409 
but then again Suzuki's had a similar
gearbox<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.710> most<00:05:41.099> of<00:05:41.250> their<00:05:41.340> cars<00:05:41.610> so<00:05:41.940> there

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
gearbox in most of their cars so there

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.129 
gearbox in most of their cars so there
shouldn't<00:05:42.630> really<00:05:42.780> be<00:05:42.990> any<00:05:43.470> problem<00:05:45.139> sound

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
shouldn't really be any problem sound

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.200 
shouldn't really be any problem sound
insulation<00:05:46.650> is<00:05:46.919> ok<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.669> go<00:05:47.819> around<00:05:47.940> the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
insulation is ok if you go around the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.020 
insulation is ok if you go around the
city<00:05:48.449> or<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.020> you<00:05:49.590> go<00:05:49.919> around<00:05:50.069> be<00:05:50.460> roads<00:05:50.759> like

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
city or if you go around be roads like

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.189 
city or if you go around be roads like
this<00:05:51.270> one<00:05:51.479> so<00:05:52.020> it's<00:05:52.199> ok<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:53.069> suspension<00:05:53.759> a<00:05:54.199> bit

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
this one so it's ok the suspension a bit

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.950 
this one so it's ok the suspension a bit
on<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.349> rough<00:05:55.590> side<00:05:55.830> I'm<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.789> saying<00:05:57.150> it's

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
on the rough side I'm not saying it's

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.200 
on the rough side I'm not saying it's
going<00:05:58.199> to<00:05:58.289> fall<00:05:58.500> apart<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:59.430> it<00:05:59.699> does<00:05:59.940> make

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
going to fall apart but it does make

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.110 
going to fall apart but it does make
unpleasant<00:06:00.840> noises<00:06:01.289> when<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:02.400> going<00:06:02.759> gets<00:06:03.000> a

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
unpleasant noises when the going gets a

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.469 
unpleasant noises when the going gets a
bit<00:06:03.240> rougher<00:06:03.690> so<00:06:04.349> that's<00:06:04.919> not<00:06:05.159> very<00:06:05.479> that's

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
bit rougher so that's not very that's

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.379 
bit rougher so that's not very that's
not<00:06:06.659> very<00:06:06.780> pleasant<00:06:07.080> but<00:06:07.530> you<00:06:08.340> know<00:06:08.460> savings

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
not very pleasant but you know savings

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.540 
not very pleasant but you know savings
had<00:06:09.659> to<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:09.960> made<00:06:10.289> somewhere<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:10.919> in<00:06:11.250> this

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
had to be made somewhere and in this

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.620 
had to be made somewhere and in this
segment<00:06:12.469> well<00:06:13.580> yeah<00:06:14.580> that's<00:06:15.150> that

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
segment well yeah that's that

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.440 
segment well yeah that's that
from<00:06:17.170> behind<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.560> wheel<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:18.040> the<00:06:18.370> Vitara<00:06:18.700> I<00:06:18.910> do

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
from behind a wheel of the Vitara I do

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.930 
from behind a wheel of the Vitara I do
feel<00:06:19.840> safe<00:06:20.470> and<00:06:20.650> confident<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.670> sitting

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
feel safe and confident the sitting

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.360 
feel safe and confident the sitting
position<00:06:22.090> is<00:06:22.480> slightly<00:06:23.020> higher<00:06:23.650> than<00:06:24.010> in

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
position is slightly higher than in

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.600 
position is slightly higher than in
normal<00:06:25.150> passenger<00:06:26.080> cars<00:06:26.380> so<00:06:26.890> I<00:06:27.160> got<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.400> good
