to have a stable consistent platform at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.609 
to have a stable consistent platform at
all<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.150> stops<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.320> what's<00:01:27.500> really

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
all the stops now what's really

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.760 
all the stops now what's really
interesting<00:01:27.979> about<00:01:28.930> this<00:01:29.930> year<00:01:30.260> is<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.409> the
