00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

in<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:01.230> segment<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.770> going<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.070> start

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
in this segment we're going to start

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.430 
in this segment we're going to start
taking<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.790> look<00:00:02.970> at<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> collect<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.110> use

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
taking a look at how to collect and use

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.280 
taking a look at how to collect and use
naturally-occurring<00:00:05.430> clay<00:00:06.210> that's<00:00:06.540> clay

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
naturally-occurring clay that's clay

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.370 
naturally-occurring clay that's clay
that<00:00:07.620> comes<00:00:07.770> straight<00:00:08.220> out<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> ground

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
that comes straight out of the ground

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.650 
that comes straight out of the ground
now<00:00:10.380> up<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.340> point<00:00:11.550> we've<00:00:11.849> looked<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.389> how

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
now up to this point we've looked at how

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.839 
now up to this point we've looked at how
to<00:00:12.719> create<00:00:13.290> your<00:00:13.530> own<00:00:13.590> clay<00:00:13.950> body<00:00:14.190> based<00:00:14.580> on

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
to create your own clay body based on

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.109 
to create your own clay body based on
highly<00:00:15.630> processed<00:00:16.550> industrial<00:00:17.550> materials

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
highly processed industrial materials

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.599 
highly processed industrial materials
but<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.840> clay<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.920> naturally

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
but because clay is a naturally

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.460 
but because clay is a naturally
occurring<00:00:20.640> substance<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> exists<00:00:22.320> right

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
occurring substance and it exists right

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279 
occurring substance and it exists right
in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.310> ground<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.900> dig<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
in the ground we can dig it out of the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.419 
in the ground we can dig it out of the
ground<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> use<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:27.019> now<00:00:28.429> remember

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
ground and use it as is now remember

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.690 
ground and use it as is now remember
that<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> sedimentary<00:00:30.420> material<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
that it's a sedimentary material so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
that it's a sedimentary material so
stream<00:00:32.700> beds<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> lake<00:00:33.600> beds<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> things

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
stream beds and lake beds and things

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709 
stream beds and lake beds and things
like<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.559> where<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.300> material<00:00:36.300> collects

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
like that where the material collects

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.510 
like that where the material collects
when<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> erosion<00:00:37.559> occurs<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.100> good<00:00:38.280> places

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
when the erosion occurs are good places

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
when the erosion occurs are good places
to<00:00:38.700> start<00:00:38.820> looking<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:39.950> depending<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.040> what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to start looking now depending on what

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
to start looking now depending on what
part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> country<00:00:41.820> you're<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.480> may

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
part of the country you're in you may

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.959 
part of the country you're in you may
have<00:00:43.320> tons<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> clay<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> may

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
have tons of clay all around you it may

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
have tons of clay all around you it may
be<00:00:45.030> right<00:00:45.360> under<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.930> grass<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.620> your<00:00:46.680> front

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
be right under your grass in your front

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
be right under your grass in your front
yard<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:48.480> under<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> topsoil<00:00:49.230> or<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.920> may

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
yard just under the topsoil or you may

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
yard just under the topsoil or you may
have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> dig<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.579> deeper<00:00:51.059> or<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.809> may

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
have to dig a little deeper or you may

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.100 
have to dig a little deeper or you may
not<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:54.629> suffice<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
not have any at all but it suffice it to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
not have any at all but it suffice it to
say<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.559> stream<00:00:55.829> beds<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> lake<00:00:56.370> beds<00:00:56.610> are

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
say that stream beds and lake beds are

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
say that stream beds and lake beds are
good<00:00:57.030> places<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.600> looking<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.230> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
good places to start looking which is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
good places to start looking which is
why<00:00:58.500> I've<00:00:58.649> identified<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.370> area<00:00:59.820> here

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
why I've identified this area here

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.650 
why I've identified this area here
because<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:01.260> stream<00:01:01.649> cut<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.699> less<00:01:03.090> topsoil

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because this stream cut has less topsoil

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.880 
because this stream cut has less topsoil
in<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> already<00:01:04.909> it's<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> bank<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> kind

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
in it already it's got the bank is kind

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179 
in it already it's got the bank is kind
of<00:01:07.950> cut<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.720> start<00:01:10.229> digging<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:10.650> here

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
of cut so I can start digging right here

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:28.590 
of cut so I can start digging right here
and<00:01:12.590> see<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.010> find

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.630 

okay<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.630> found<00:01:30.049> some<00:01:30.320> clay<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.830> didn't<00:01:31.460> have<00:01:31.549> to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
okay I found some clay I didn't have to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450 
okay I found some clay I didn't have to
dig<00:01:31.790> too<00:01:31.909> deep<00:01:32.710> as<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.890> can<00:01:34.040> see<00:01:34.220> hopefully

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
dig too deep as you can see hopefully

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.160 
dig too deep as you can see hopefully
you<00:01:34.700> can<00:01:34.790> see<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:35.360> looks<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:35.630> strata

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
you can see this it looks like strata

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.280 
you can see this it looks like strata
like<00:01:36.680> layers<00:01:37.450> if<00:01:38.450> you've<00:01:38.630> ever<00:01:38.780> seen<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
like layers if you've ever seen a

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.440 
like layers if you've ever seen a
picture<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.280> Grand<00:01:40.460> Canyon<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:40.970> instance

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
picture of the Grand Canyon for instance

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.180 
picture of the Grand Canyon for instance
then<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.690> know<00:01:42.020> what<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.470> looks<00:01:42.710> like<00:01:42.950> the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
then you know what that looks like the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.010 
then you know what that looks like the
sedimentary<00:01:44.090> material<00:01:44.240> that's<00:01:44.750> collected

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
sedimentary material that's collected

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.889 
sedimentary material that's collected
over<00:01:45.500> time<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:46.970> just<00:01:47.360> what<00:01:47.479> this<00:01:47.630> is

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
over time and that's just what this is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.950 
over time and that's just what this is
so<00:01:48.550> but<00:01:49.550> it's<00:01:49.700> got<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> different<00:01:50.149> coloration

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
so but it's got a different coloration

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.730 
so but it's got a different coloration
to<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.409> it's<00:01:52.130> got<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.880> sticky<00:01:53.740> plastic

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
to it and it's got that sticky plastic

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.370 
to it and it's got that sticky plastic
kind<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.369> feel<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.640> we're<00:01:56.090> looking<00:01:56.360> for<00:01:56.630> out

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
kind of feel that we're looking for out

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.940 
kind of feel that we're looking for out
of<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.680> clay<00:01:57.890> body<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.350> there's<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.470> lot<00:02:00.770> of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
of a clay body so there's a lot of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.370 
of a clay body so there's a lot of
organic<00:02:01.280> matter<00:02:01.550> here<00:02:01.880> leaves<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:02.960> twigs<00:02:03.050> and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
organic matter here leaves and twigs and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.600 
organic matter here leaves and twigs and
I<00:02:03.440> had<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.649> cut<00:02:03.800> through<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.039> bunch<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.369> roots

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
I had to cut through a bunch of roots

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.149 
I had to cut through a bunch of roots
and<00:02:04.850> things<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.390> down<00:02:05.990> in<00:02:06.229> here<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.679> I'm

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
and things to get down in here so I'm

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.949 
and things to get down in here so I'm
going<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.340> try<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.670> avoid<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:08.179> much<00:02:08.780> as

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
going to try and avoid as much as

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.600 
going to try and avoid as much as
possible<00:02:09.410> getting<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.830> extraneous<00:02:10.399> crap

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
possible getting that extraneous crap

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.390 
possible getting that extraneous crap
into<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> clay<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.860> less<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.280> clean

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
into the clay so I have less to clean

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.770 
into the clay so I have less to clean
out<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.269> kind<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.540> inevitable<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:16.190> then

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
out but it's kind of inevitable and then

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.910 
out but it's kind of inevitable and then
after<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> dig<00:02:18.110> some<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.500> out<00:02:18.680> I'm<00:02:18.860> going

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
after I dig some of this out I'm going

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.590 
after I dig some of this out I'm going
to<00:02:19.100> show<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.340> how<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> clean<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.569> that

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
to show you how to clean out that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.960 
to show you how to clean out that
extraneous<00:02:21.470> material<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.370> prepare<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.940> for

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
extraneous material and prepare it for

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.550 
extraneous material and prepare it for
testing<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.019> use<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.739> your<00:02:25.010> ceramic<00:02:25.400> work
