come with a turbocharger on and we're

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.730 
come with a turbocharger on and we're
going<00:01:30.510> to<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.660> decent<00:01:30.930> diameter<00:01:31.470> exhaust

system for decent power levels for
factory<00:01:33.870> power<00:01:34.050> levels<00:01:34.410> but<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> talk

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
factory power levels but when you talk

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.500 
factory power levels but when you talk
in<00:01:35.220> performance<00:01:35.730> you're<00:01:35.850> talking<00:01:36.150> flow

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
in performance you're talking flow

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.120 
in performance you're talking flow
that's<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.890> something

down<00:02:08.819> pipe<00:02:09.090> did<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> good

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
down pipe did when you have a good

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.899 
down pipe did when you have a good

well-made High Flow catalytic converter
so<00:02:12.629> now<00:02:12.750> we're<00:02:12.900> talking<00:02:12.959> about<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.319> what

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so now we're talking about that what

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.619 
so now we're talking about that what
does<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.010> down<00:02:14.099> pipe<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.550> why<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.360> want<00:02:15.540> a

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
does it down pipe do why do you want a

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.630 
does it down pipe do why do you want a
bigger<00:02:15.810> diameter<00:02:16.019> down<00:02:16.409> pipe<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.400> idea

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
bigger diameter down pipe the idea

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
bigger diameter down pipe the idea
behind<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.239> you're<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.050> get

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
behind this is that you're going to get

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
behind this is that you're going to get
more<00:02:19.470> air<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.190> turbocharger<00:02:20.730> faster

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
more air out of the turbocharger faster

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.740 
more air out of the turbocharger faster
which<00:02:21.750> means<00:02:21.780> more<00:02:22.620> power<00:02:22.829> down<00:02:23.069> low

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
which means more power down low

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.210 
which means more power down low
use<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:24.080> faster<00:02:24.560> spool<00:02:24.770> up<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.100> your

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
use a faster spool up of your

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.950 
use a faster spool up of your
turbocharger<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.420> you're<00:02:26.540> looking<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:26.900> a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
turbocharger so if you're looking for a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.420 
turbocharger so if you're looking for a
little<00:02:27.080> more<00:02:27.200> low<00:02:27.560> anger<00:02:27.920> out<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.160> want<00:02:28.310> that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
little more low anger out you want that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.890 
little more low anger out you want that
turbo<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.760> get<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.180> little<00:02:29.240> bit<00:02:29.450> faster

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
turbo to get going a little bit faster

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.700 
turbo to get going a little bit faster
down<00:02:30.500> pipe<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> answer<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:32.470> PDS<00:02:33.470> always

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
adding a catback you're going to get

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.850 
adding a catback you're going to get
generally<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> little<00:02:44.510> bit<00:02:44.630> more<00:02:44.900> sound<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
generally a little bit more sound to it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.400

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
Volvo but it doesn't mean that some

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
the vehicle on white IPD systems are so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.840 
the vehicle on white IPD systems are so
nice<00:03:24.650> especially<00:03:24.980> when<00:03:25.160> fitting<00:03:25.550> underneath

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
nice especially when fitting underneath

the car it's going to save you labor and
time<00:03:27.440> there's<00:03:28.130> definitely<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.550> lot<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.670> quality

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
time there's definitely a lot of quality

your car so I'm going to show you that
right<00:03:32.600> now<00:03:32.630> if<00:03:33.200> you<00:03:33.320> look<00:03:33.500> here<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:34.340> here<00:03:34.459> is

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
right now if you look here right here is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.040 
right now if you look here right here is
the<00:03:34.670> end<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.880> down<00:03:35.030> pipe<00:03:35.239> that<00:03:35.780> we<00:03:35.870> talked

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
the end of the down pipe that we talked

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.540 
the end of the down pipe that we talked
about<00:03:36.170> previously<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.190> everything

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
about previously and then everything

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.180 
about previously and then everything
from<00:03:37.760> back<00:03:37.910> here<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:39.010> referenced<00:03:40.010> as<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
from back here on is referenced as the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.250 
from back here on is referenced as the
catback<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.269> reason<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.780> because<00:03:41.989> it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
catback the reason is is because it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.350 
catback the reason is is because it's
everything<00:03:42.470> behind<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.550> back<00:03:44.000> from<00:03:44.269> the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
everything behind and back from the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.910 
everything behind and back from the
catalytic<00:03:44.810> converter<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.560> that's<00:03:45.709> going<00:03:45.860> to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
catalytic converter so that's going to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.320 
catalytic converter so that's going to
consist<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.459> sometimes<00:03:46.700> called<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.180> mid

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
consist of this sometimes called a mid

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.690 
consist of this sometimes called a mid
pipe<00:03:47.540> up<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:48.200> here<00:03:48.530> which<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:49.070> resonator

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
pipe up to here which is a resonator

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.400 
pipe up to here which is a resonator
which<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.330> what<00:03:50.480> kind<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.750> tones<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.230> sound

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
which is what kind of tones the sound

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.020 
which is what kind of tones the sound
like<00:03:51.590> Chris<00:03:51.800> talked<00:03:52.010> about<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.459> then<00:03:52.820> again

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
like Chris talked about and then again

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.300 
like Chris talked about and then again
we<00:03:53.150> go<00:03:53.269> up<00:03:53.510> over<00:03:53.870> here<00:03:54.140> up<00:03:54.620> over<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.980> rear<00:03:55.130> end

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
we go up over here up over the rear end

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.710 
we go up over here up over the rear end
in<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.459> Delta<00:03:55.730> link<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.299> rear<00:03:56.480> muffler

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
in the Delta link to the rear muffler

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.259 
in the Delta link to the rear muffler
and<00:03:57.140> then<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> exhaust<00:03:58.070> tip<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:58.970> as<00:03:59.150> we

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
and then to the exhaust tip now as we

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.490 
and then to the exhaust tip now as we
talked<00:03:59.480> about<00:03:59.570> with<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.870> down<00:04:00.019> pipe<00:04:00.230> there's

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
talked about with the down pipe there's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.990 
talked about with the down pipe there's
a<00:04:00.560> few<00:04:00.739> main<00:04:00.860> things<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.190> make<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.549> a<00:04:01.640> catback

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
a few main things that make in a catback

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.479 
a few main things that make in a catback
system<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.450> performance<00:04:03.049> system<00:04:03.350> diameter<00:04:04.280> and

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
system a performance system diameter and

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.210 
system a performance system diameter and
material<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.330> then<00:04:05.540> quality<00:04:05.900> F<00:04:06.290> flow<00:04:06.709> through

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
material and then quality F flow through

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.380 
material and then quality F flow through
the<00:04:07.370> resonators<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:07.880> through<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.120> mufflers
