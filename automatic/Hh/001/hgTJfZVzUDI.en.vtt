00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.700
 moin moin here is is row of the 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.710
 North German hackers and today times 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.630
 a little shorter video and today it should 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.500
 once at the frame rate go to black 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.790
 So ops 2 is about the ps2 and that concerns 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.390
 Of course, now only the pc 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.490
 player 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.239
 because with the console, it's more my 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.980
 I so it runs constant at 60 fps 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:25.669
 and with me it was me at bc too 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.810
 previously so 60 fps constant and now that 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.939
 can increase all a bit and 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.579
 that makes w are not fun anymore 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.899
 The enemy sees much faster you can 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.600
 accordingly the fast react 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.690
 even if you somehow more than 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.280
 The human should be 60 or even 60 fps 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.199
 can no longer perceive but believes 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.399
 I was taking it easy was the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.050
 difference is so incredible one 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.149
 Above all, it improves so incredibly 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.460
 and that's why I think so 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.230
 relatively few and that would be why 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.940
 I like to do it again as you do 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.120
 We can not increase the frame rate 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.920
 first of all on the desktop there goes 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 yes even right mouse and then either 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.559
 I can only do that now 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.659
 say for nvidia because I have now 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.840
 again graphics card then you go on 3d 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.640
 Settings manage that up there 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.780
 and then on program settings there 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.550
 you have to go all the way down 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.230
 scroll there you have the vertical 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.750
 synchronization the stahlgewitter on 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.270
 so completely out that is in all 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.010
 programs is that out there so well 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.050
 that it turned off completely 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.190
 if you are in the game then you would have to 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.320
 I go again to the options 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 on the attitude and you see 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.790
 have the resolution on full-hd left 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.950
 you can do that on the bigger one 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 then fieldplayer make resolution 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.180
 I have 90 shadows 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.890
 deactivated and also at 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.840
 I have advanced all the details 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.640
 as far as possible I screwed down 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.810
 I have noticed that again and again 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.610
 puts and frame again and again 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.960
 if you have the details 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.760
 I really had a superscript 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 I would say so now 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.250
 really good gamer pc but it did so 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 many frame burglaries that's how 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.220
 I also do not enjoy it then I play 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.930
 rather with worse graphics on then 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.720
 I have a bit more fun 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.850
 overall so the picture synchronization 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.970
 yet that is exactly adjust to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.340
 the same thing we did with the nvidia card 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 have made just now 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.989
 and here the refresh rate 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.459
 on unlimited here the frequency 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.590
 you can show that then here 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.440
 The numbers corner is a bit around that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.060
 I would love to observe that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.849
 otherwise you do not need that 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.870
 for playing necessarily yes I can 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.560
 See you soon 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.930
 how that looks in game for me 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.580
 own games and games start like that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.769
 so graphically for me now looks like 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.590
 really does not look really great 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.870
 The textures are now by nature 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.890
 from now not really great but in 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.209
 the case does not feel that way 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.860
 really cool but it does it 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.019
 much more fun if you just have a lot 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.269
 liquid the whole game I have 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.220
 now about 60 frames that is now 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.569
 resume 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.560
 cancer , I think only with maximum 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.760
 just under 120 fps record but more 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.099
 But webster does not manage that either 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.690
 if you are in public play then 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.959
 quite at 211 ps and exactly 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.030
 publicly in my own game I wanted 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.889
 say there you have then I had 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.350
 so up to 400 ps are not 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.139
 limited so the whole looks just 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.609
 become 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.910
 yes I play with these settings 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:28.900
 but that's not what it is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.519
 can then go out again and you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.769
 the normal at full resolution 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.930
 Show how the whole then for me too 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.180
 looks and I have to say it lies 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.970
 then much nicer but me that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 is where we have burglaries around me 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:48.960
 That's why I would recommend it all 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:04:01.950
 turn off so setting we 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:04:06.040
 extra yes that just now 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 unknown so start the game sees 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.070
 then much nicer but how 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.500
 said then less fun 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.970
 one has the feeling if the opponents too 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.380
 had come to a city columbia 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.090
 but otherwise no chance 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.310
 before he has one much earlier 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.799
 seen and you fall up before you 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.390
 you've ever seen something 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.980
 no chance reigns here has 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.660
 the feeling it is only 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.280
 but it really is like that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.320
 you also greatly improved 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.760
 and now it's a little better 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.419
 actually, the whole thing is so useful 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.500
 from filming easier where I am now 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.110
 again a bit more a bit 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.710
 less but you can tell it clearly 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.790
 when playing a difference of 60 fps 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.110
 now I have entered and 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.770
 shoots a bit now has the top 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.740
 left now I'm out now 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.050
 I have about 70 now and again I 60 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.610
 go back in the immediately the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.970
 frames down and that's a bit 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.100
 the problem with it and that's why I leave 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.820
 that's all on me all the time 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.190
 attitude 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.169
 Well, I hope you have it now 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.290
 helped and you then have 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.790
 more fun while playing is only for the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.860
 pc people but i can do the convention 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.660
 Consoleros teenie have the problem 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.030
 do not care that especially fluid and 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.030
 from now until next time bye
