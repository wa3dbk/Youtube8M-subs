00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.490
 another video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.740
 Some time ago we have a gaming 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 pc built together to be exact 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.099
 who is standing there behind 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.599
 and I still owe you a conclusion 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 that means in this video it is about it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.949
 I like the calculator too 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 of course with a few benchmarks 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.850
 few games sequences and fps pay the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 to be achieved in these games etc 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 and I would say if you have the pc 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.859
 have not seen video then 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 it looks only at the left is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 below in the description and if you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 already knows then just look here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.949
 further after the intro we start a lot 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.949
 fun 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.980
 first of all I am really 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.780
 very satisfied with this calculator 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.120
 Everything works perfectly 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.040
 no problems no crashes 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.210
 or anything else in this 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.190
 Direction so in any case ever 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.050
 did everything right both what the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 At least the hardware selection is concerned 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 in my opinion as well as the yes 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.900
 actual assembles the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.239
 installation and so on in this 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.010
 view everything so great then 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.290
 I am personally of the performance 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.910
 definitely very happy with the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.010
 last windows machine i had 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.450
 that was basically five years old that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.920
 So five years ago I have that 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.580
 assembled there was then of course 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.410
 Super 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.869
 when I did that before one and a half 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.630
 had used the last time 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.759
 He slight performance problems I says 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.259
 just times or just for this gaming 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.789
 things he was not really too 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.460
 So you need everyone 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.170
 fall on deadlines and I have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.660
 yes in the form of this new calculator in 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.860
 Basically, now done on everyone 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.170
 case, the differences are natural 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.050
 gigantic if it alone on the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.750
 Comparing well during the old one 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.450
 calculator despite retrofitted ssd intended 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.750
 used to boot his 25 seconds 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.520
 has the gaming pc here within 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.049
 not even ten seconds ready 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.369
 So really on the desktop 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.810
 started up and also has the programs 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.780
 and so on everything loaded from the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.689
 autostart so that's really fix it 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.580
 you can barely watch and you can not 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.520
 otherwise everything really plays with them 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.490
 great I mostly have cry 4 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.579
 and now there are only two years left 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.160
 weeks I think gta 5 played and 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.560
 Both of them are absolutely fluid 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 highest settings and also gta 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 Anything he really does 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
 really needs performance for 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.269
 has to have running on the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.120
 highest settings with 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.950
 constant 50 to 60 frames per second 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.519
 In any case, in my view 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.230
 One hundred percent so I'm very 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.130
 is satisfied you can give me love 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.959
 Of course, in the comments 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.340
 Write like you all see me 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.420
 are missing so a little bit the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.310
 comparative values 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 but I think you can do that on everyone 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.060
 I will be happy if you will 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.079
 here in between we already 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.329
 always looks a few 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.000
 So film sequences from the games 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.030
 you see around a corner the fpr 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.680
 pay and I'll be right of course 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.270
 also a few other benchmarks 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.180
 so that you all this time a little 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.080
 The performance can be classified a bit 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.300
 So it's great 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.740
 it continues with the volume also 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.840
 there was this comparison for me again 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.610
 my old computer was pretty loud that 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.280
 has disturbed me again and again 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.570
 I was glad that my imac I yes 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.940
 Mainly rain in the rain 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.430
 video clip and so on that one from 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.380
 almost not listening to it and me completely 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.590
 extremely similar but it is synonymous with the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.630
 he is very quiet when you can not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.260
 you do not care much about it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.720
 I say 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.610
 and if you really stop him 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.230
 So it really plays that stresses 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.880
 Eurobahn longer period and so on 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.350
 then he will of course be a little one 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.370
 a bit louder but that holds up 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.680
 every case in limits 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.880
 it does not really bother me at all 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.080
 you have the headset or something on 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.590
 anyway you do not hear anything 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.660
 from that 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.520
 but even if you are completely normal without 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.640
 headset only with the yes with speakers 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 say I play does not bother so from 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.930
 therefore, this aspect also applies to everyone 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.610
 case in order 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.500
 now you might think okay if he does 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.220
 quiet is either should be easy 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.440
 well clear 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.900
 or they are too slow to cool that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.280
 So it really does you see 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.650
 here also just intervened 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.170
 few temperature values that was now 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.830
 play after about two hours gta 5 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.440
 and everything within the framework so both the cdu 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.530
 as well as the graphics card the course 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.489
 already warm is not a question but absolutely 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.709
 located in the green area and therefore 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.510
 do not consider anything cool and that 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.850
 whole despite the relatively small 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.470
 volume under the pc video you have 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.110
 Of course , asked many questions and 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.090
 I think the most common was why I was 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.470
 no drive was installed or 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.810
 why is a housing chosen where 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.190
 you can not block a drive and 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.960
 yes, the housing I just liked 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.310
 there it was secondary for me if then 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
 drive would fit in or not 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.760
 especially since I just do not need it 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.470
 I also do not build one 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.570
 my sunday does not cost much 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.760
 meanwhile I do not know 20 euro to it 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.979
 you have a reasonable drive but me 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.960
 it just is not necessary anymore 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.830
 what I need so I can over my 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.690
 procure internet 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.090
 You can even play games in the meantime 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.050
 buy all online and accordingly 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.310
 I have no need there 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.569
 to use them another object I 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.190
 faith for a year and a half or so 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.159
 I did not need a drive anymore 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.949
 and therefore no idea is for 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.750
 Absolutely not necessary if it happens 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.190
 I have to have one 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.259
 external drive in the drawer 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.690
 So I'm 1 so that's why 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.110
 then no problem but I need 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.479
 so far 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.740
 In no case the second question the 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.620
 was asked very frequently 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.650
 why such a weak power supply weak 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.960
 in quotes 430 watts it has 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.550
 performance and the rich easy 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.409
 completely out of this system 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.379
 I 've tried it all under 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.050
 full load he sees about 280 to 300 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.900
 watt that means we still have over 130 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.080
 or just 150 depending on where 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.150
 they are not even used 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.860
 and thus it is completely enough for me 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.610
 do not need a larger power supply 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.530
 obstruct and therefore the components 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.789
 it just keeps getting more efficient 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.099
 not necessary for such a system 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.940
 somehow 1 600 watts power supply or something 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.030
 to hang in there 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.069
 that's enough for you 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.380
 with the logitech peripherals bin 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.259
 I am very satisfied with the g 910 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.810
 as keyboard and the g500 two as 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.490
 gaming mouse very great products with 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.199
 many details fell that I have too 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.150
 saying only so afterwards found out 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:20.270
 Of course I'm a lot of gimmicks 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.639
 also as an example when playing gta 5 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.880
 and the police on one attentively 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.560
 will speak one has stars then shine 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.629
 the f keys alternately turn red and blue 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.210
 give the police siren everything 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.860
 Trivia really nice you have to 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.659
 not have but it is funny 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.120
 if you have it and of course it does 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.460
 play a certain feeling again 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.050
 somehow a review does not know about it 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.819
 he also likes to go down to the 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.580
 see description there is linked 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.680
 and so much for the first time again 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.090
 logitech stuff and then we are too 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.710
 again at the end of this video 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.389
 I hope you have it 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.159
 and of course I would 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.449
 about feedback in the form of one 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.379
 comment or a thumbs up 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.479
 very pleased 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.219
 and yes, if you still have any questions 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.259
 have to this calculator 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.669
 there she also writes 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.800
 just in the comments 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.089
 So I say goodbye now 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.089
 next time it makes good people
