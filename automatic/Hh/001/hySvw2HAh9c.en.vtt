to make this different because I want to
call<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> performance<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840

call<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> casual<00:00:20.420> but<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.539> still<00:00:21.750> takes

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
call it what a casual but it still takes

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.269 
call it what a casual but it still takes
all<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.439> abuse<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.830> need<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> give<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

format it's just a little bit different
vamp<00:00:44.640> structure<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.770> just<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:48.059> if

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
vamp structure it's just because now if

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.299 
vamp structure it's just because now if
you<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.809> vamp<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.710> you'll

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you see this vamp and you know you'll

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
you see this vamp and you know you'll
know<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> that's<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> double<00:00:51.239> H<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
know that that's a double H but just

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
know that that's a double H but just
something<00:00:52.680> different<00:00:52.980> than<00:00:53.309> our<00:00:53.399> design<00:00:53.670> team

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
something different than our design team

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.290 
something different than our design team
came<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.289> mr.<00:00:55.289> LeBeau<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.100> charged<00:00:57.059> that

came up with mr. LeBeau is charged that
yeah<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> great<00:00:58.140> job<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.920> something

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
yeah it's did a great job it's something

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
yeah it's did a great job it's something
different<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.390> everybody<00:01:01.160> has<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
different not everybody has this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
different not everybody has this
structure<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.600> everybody<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.290> about

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
structure it's not everybody how about

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
structure it's not everybody how about
how<00:01:04.650> nobody<00:01:05.250> has<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.790> I've<00:01:06.119> seen<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
how nobody has that I've seen this is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.240 
how nobody has that I've seen this is
probably<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> most<00:01:07.860> unique

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
probably one of the most unique

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
probably one of the most unique
structures<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> refer<00:01:09.900> back

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
structures and what do you refer back

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.530 
structures and what do you refer back
that's<00:01:10.650> referring<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that's referring to here is how this is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
that's referring to here is how this is
cut<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> side<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.950> almost<00:01:14.130> adds<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
cut out on the side it almost adds a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
cut out on the side it almost adds a
little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.299> support<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.869> guy

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
little bit more support for that guy

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
little bit more support for that guy
that<00:01:16.200> wants<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> put<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> spur<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> back

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that wants to put a spur on the back

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
that wants to put a spur on the back
instead<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.049> making<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> different<00:01:19.830> color

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
instead of just making a different color

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.590 
instead of just making a different color
leather<00:01:20.310> you've<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.850> doubled<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
leather you've actually doubled that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.469 
leather you've actually doubled that
leather<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.470> correct<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
leather up so it's correct we put a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.850 
leather up so it's correct we put a
little<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.689> detail<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> look

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
little more detail with it if you look

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
little more detail with it if you look
at<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> edges<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> edges<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.729> perforated

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
at the edges the edges are perforated

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
at the edges the edges are perforated
with<00:01:27.360> little<00:01:27.600> holes<00:01:27.780> yes<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
with little holes yes little more

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
with little holes yes little more
detailing<00:01:29.520> again<00:01:30.240> puts<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> cool<00:01:31.200> factor<00:01:31.680> in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
detailing again puts that cool factor in
