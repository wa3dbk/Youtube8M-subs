yoga job did I do a good job you think

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.580 
yoga job did I do a good job you think
those<00:03:15.359> three<00:03:15.510> quotes<00:03:15.750> read<00:03:16.049> I'm<00:03:16.200> not<00:03:16.379> even

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
those three quotes read I'm not even

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.759 
those three quotes read I'm not even
done<00:03:16.769> yet<00:03:16.829> look<00:03:17.310> at<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.780> uh<00:03:18.780> but

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
done yet look at this uh but

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.710 
done yet look at this uh but
Washington's<00:03:20.519> harshly<00:03:20.910> partisan<00:03:21.569> atmosphere

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
Washington's harshly partisan atmosphere

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.319 
Washington's harshly partisan atmosphere
makes<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> prospect<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.310> Republican<00:03:23.910> support

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
makes the prospect of Republican support

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.670 
makes the prospect of Republican support
uncertain<00:03:25.290> did<00:03:26.099> leave<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.579> up<00:03:26.699> you<00:03:27.000> get<00:03:27.209> that

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
uncertain did leave that up you get that

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.289 
uncertain did leave that up you get that
so<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.949> not<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> Republicans<00:03:29.879> fault<00:03:30.090> for

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
so it's not the Republicans fault for

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.319 
so it's not the Republicans fault for
being<00:03:30.449> obstinate<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:32.280> Washington<00:03:33.060> being

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
being obstinate it's a Washington being

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.899 
being obstinate it's a Washington being
partisan<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:35.010> driving<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.639> poor

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
partisan that is driving the poor

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.539 
partisan that is driving the poor
Republicans<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:37.379> be<00:03:37.530> uncertain<00:03:38.190> about<00:03:38.280> their

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
Republicans to be uncertain about their

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.240 
Republicans to be uncertain about their
support<00:03:39.030> if<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.900> works<00:03:40.109> if<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.709> Democrats

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
support if it works if the Democrats

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.789 
support if it works if the Democrats
weren't<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:41.819> harshly<00:03:42.449> partisan<00:03:43.199> well<00:03:43.620> then

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
weren't so harshly partisan well then

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.930 
weren't so harshly partisan well then
maybe<00:03:43.979> the<00:03:44.129> Republic's<00:03:44.489> could<00:03:44.639> give<00:03:44.790> them

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
maybe the Republic's could give them

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.539 
maybe the Republic's could give them
their<00:03:45.060> support<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.229> as<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.340> poor

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
their support but as it is the poor

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.250 
their support but as it is the poor
Republicans<00:03:48.060> obviously<00:03:48.599> can<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.079> on<00:03:49.169> the
