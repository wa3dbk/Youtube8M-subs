much<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:34.050> little<00:04:34.230> one<00:04:35.100> little<00:04:35.250> game

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
much on just one little one little game

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.690 
much on just one little one little game
way<00:04:35.760> cart<00:04:36.050> it's<00:04:37.050> really<00:04:37.460> really<00:04:38.460> worth<00:04:38.580> all

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
way cart it's really really worth all

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.070 
way cart it's really really worth all
the<00:04:38.880> time<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> takes<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.420> play<00:04:39.570> through<00:04:39.720> it's

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
the time it takes to play through it's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.230 
the time it takes to play through it's
not<00:04:40.170> even<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.500> long<00:04:40.530> either<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.850> took<00:04:42.030> what

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
not even that long either this took what

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.020 
not even that long either this took what
I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.660> probably<00:04:43.500> 33<00:04:44.160> 32<00:04:44.610> parts

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
I think this is probably 33 32 parts

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.420 
I think this is probably 33 32 parts
something<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:45.450> that<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:47.250> not<00:04:47.370> that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
something like that so it's not that

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.460 
something like that so it's not that
long<00:04:47.780> definitely<00:04:48.780> what<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> play<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.350> got

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
long definitely what a play you got

to me we do anything now I think what

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.820 
to me we do anything now I think what
kind<00:05:30.060> of<00:05:30.150> stuck<00:05:30.390> at<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.600> screen<00:05:30.870> start<00:05:31.440> select

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
kind of stuck at the screen start select

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.430 
kind of stuck at the screen start select
up<00:05:32.310> down<00:05:32.760> all<00:05:32.970> around<00:05:33.229> yeah<00:05:34.229> nothing<00:05:34.620> um<00:05:35.430> so

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
up down all around yeah nothing um so

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.110 
up down all around yeah nothing um so
that's<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.590> that's<00:05:37.919> that's<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.340> game<00:05:38.490> guys<00:05:38.729> so
