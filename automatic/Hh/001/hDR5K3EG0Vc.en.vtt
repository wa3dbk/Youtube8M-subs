00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.430
 court on Christmas Eve gave me 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 actually it fits much better 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.060
 New Year's Eve and we still have that in front of us 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.910
 but of course taste experience 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.919
 other day it is the own creation and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.450
 actually rather a mixture of good 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.579
 goulash and offered courier 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.890
 it tastes really delicious 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.440
 and we'll see you soon 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.700
 The preparation is simply the recipe 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.399

 website esslust blog.de 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.320
 we need a good breast filet 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.840
 although with similar works too 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.520
 but yogurt also whipped it 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.060
 be replaced by the soya variant 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.570
 could 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.770
 a big onion 1 garlic clove 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.650
 mushrooms and it can be frogs 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.170
 or a piece of celery from the tin 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.840
 a carrot so if the greens 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.180
 buys everything there and a round 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.309
 bread this is only optional 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.590
 as a suggestion you could go to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.810
 church as well or a baguette 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.360
 In addition, oil salt curry is enough 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.479
 duty and optional, however, fits 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.900
 excellent with blackcurrant and 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.159
 ground cumin moved around him first 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.260
 let's cut the meat in 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.870
 bite-sized pieces and I cut it 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.960
 first cross in and then 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.240
 long ago in dice now after mine 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.520
 beloved technique onion finely dice 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.420
 So let's get on top and then 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.340
 cut vertically parallel to 90 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.940
 Grad turn again with cut 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.010
 then put down and down 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.920
 cut and the onion is already 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.380
 Ruckzuck cut small and out of the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.710
 garlic clove is chopped small 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.070
 we halve the cleaned carrot and 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.119
 then cut into slices 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.420
 even the celery will be in dice 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.759
 cut and the pauli in the bringe in 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.110
 We heat the pot with water 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.900
 then the vegetables inside 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.209
 lid on it and cook is short so 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.860
 for about three to five minutes 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.959
 then put in a sieve and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.819
 Drain 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.130
 We heat in a large pan 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.170
 Give about three tablespoons of oil 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.790
 meat cube and fry this 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 and you have to decide for yourself 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.750
 whether he likes it like lighter or 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.760
 darker so a little sharper seared 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.480

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.019
 in the pan 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.700
 should you use it fresh there is 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.890
 right at the beginning together with the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.590
 do everything onions and onions 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.390
 fry for about 3 more minutes 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.750
 then pour the yogurt into it 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.900
 also whipped cream or alternatively the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.720
 mix and if you give it to me 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.389
 like to have a big spoon 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.790
 tomato marrow and then at medium 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.549
 heat for about eight to ten minutes 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.739
 simmer and then take from the stove 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.079
 in the meantime, we are preparing 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.989
 in parallel, cut the bread before 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.340
 So first cut off a lid 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.829
 then with a sharp knife 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.989
 around with a distance of approx 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.760
 one centimeter for a country the bread 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.459
 take care that he is 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.079
 cuts through and then one 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.549
 the spoon bread detach inner 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.889
 still stuck particles stick out 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.870
 and we already have one 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.840

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.480

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.739
 then serve a bread that is one 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.989
 original variant 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.769

 However you say other party appropriate 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.930
 For example, recipes are better 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.729
