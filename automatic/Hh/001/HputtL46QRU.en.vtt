the<00:00:33.000> new<00:00:33.149> ones<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> few<00:00:34.469> downfalls<00:00:34.920> one

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the new ones there's a few downfalls one

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 
the new ones there's a few downfalls one
it's<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.149> small<00:00:36.600> map<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> also<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> good

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it's a small map which is also a good

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.069 
it's a small map which is also a good
thing<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.219> guess<00:00:38.430> sometimes<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
thing I guess sometimes there's not a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
thing I guess sometimes there's not a
lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> camping<00:00:40.739> spots<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> campers<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
lot of camping spots for you campers I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630 
lot of camping spots for you campers I
can't<00:00:42.629> sue<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.170> there's<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> lot<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> those

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
can't sue so there's not a lot of those

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.740 
can't sue so there's not a lot of those
this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.879> probably<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> best<00:00:45.600> spots

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this is probably one of the best spots

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
this is probably one of the best spots
to<00:00:45.989> camp<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.739> balcony<00:00:47.010> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to camp up here on this balcony but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.220 
to camp up here on this balcony but
there's<00:00:47.879> still<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.210> access<00:00:48.660> points<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
there's still two access points so

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.770 
there's still two access points so
that's<00:00:50.160> something<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.520> definitely<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.420> think

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that's something they definitely I think

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's something they definitely I think
that's<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.350> upgrade<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.890> modern<00:00:53.160> warfare<00:00:53.309> 2

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that's an upgrade from modern warfare 2

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's an upgrade from modern warfare 2
late<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.000> always<00:00:54.030> seems<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:55.020> than<00:00:55.079> one

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
late as always seems to be more than one

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
late as always seems to be more than one
access<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.850> makes<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> harder<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
access point so it makes it harder to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.220 
access point so it makes it harder to
camp<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> good<00:00:58.410> thing<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:59.730> yeah<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230
