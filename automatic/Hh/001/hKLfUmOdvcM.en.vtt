00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fingernails grow so what I did the day I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580

any difference you know it's because

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
any difference you know it's because

tell<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.640> didn't<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:44.970> think<00:01:45.060> anything

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
tell and I didn't really think anything

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.550 
tell and I didn't really think anything
of<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> only<00:01:45.930> thing<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of it the only thing that I really

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
of it the only thing that I really
noticed<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.159> certain<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> was

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
noticed for certain was that it was

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.880 
noticed for certain was that it was
falling<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.630> less<00:01:48.869> when<00:01:49.320> I'd<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> the
