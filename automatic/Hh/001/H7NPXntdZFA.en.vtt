or do all carbs make you fat the answer
is<00:00:26.609> no<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.539> need<00:00:27.570> carbohydrates<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:29.070> make

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279

carbohydrates now exactly what is a car

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
carbohydrates now exactly what is a car
carbs<00:00:43.230> can<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.530> things<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:43.950> bread<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.180> pasta

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
carbs can be things like bread and pasta

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.860 
carbs can be things like bread and pasta
and<00:00:46.110> potatoes<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:47.100> they're<00:00:47.280> also<00:00:47.570> fruits<00:00:48.570> and

vegetables and some beans and a lot of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
vegetables and some beans and a lot of
people<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.660> think<00:00:52.170> bread<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.860> pasta<00:00:53.010> when

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
people just think bread and pasta when

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
people just think bread and pasta when
they<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.820> carbs<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.960> foots<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
they think carbs when really foots and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
they think carbs when really foots and
vegetables<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.370> give<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
vegetables can give you the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.599 
vegetables can give you the
carbohydrates<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.609> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
carbohydrates that you need as well so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
carbohydrates that you need as well so
when<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> eat<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> carbohydrate<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.559> body

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
when you eat a carbohydrate your body
takes<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.850> breaks<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
takes them and breaks them down and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
takes them and breaks them down and
creates<00:01:04.530> glucose<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.119> need<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
creates glucose and you need that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.960 
creates glucose and you need that
glucose<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.590> blood<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.280> order<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
glucose in your blood in order to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
glucose in your blood in order to
function<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.350> also<00:01:10.650> takes<00:01:11.070> these

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
function well it also takes these

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
function well it also takes these
carbohydrates<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.330> stores<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.229> energy<00:01:13.979> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
carbohydrates and stores it as energy in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
carbohydrates and stores it as energy in
your<00:01:14.460> liver<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.450> muscles<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
your liver and in your muscles so if you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
your liver and in your muscles so if you
exercise<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> eat<00:01:18.840> carbs

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
exercise you really do need to eat carbs

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
exercise you really do need to eat carbs
the<00:01:20.009> problem<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> people

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the problem is is that a lot of people

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.039 
the problem is is that a lot of people
are<00:01:22.200> eating<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.770> overabundance<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
are eating an overabundance of

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
are eating an overabundance of
carbohydrates<00:01:25.049> especially<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> form<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
carbohydrates especially in the form of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
carbohydrates especially in the form of
processed<00:01:27.210> foods<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> baked<00:01:28.200> goods<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
processed foods and baked goods and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
processed foods and baked goods and
different<00:01:29.640> breads<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.840> pasta<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
different breads and a lot of pasta and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
different breads and a lot of pasta and
that's<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.250> we're<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.729> wrong<00:01:33.049> another

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that's where we're going wrong another

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
that's where we're going wrong another
thing<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> happens<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.250> carbohydrates<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
thing that happens with carbohydrates is
they<00:01:36.750> turn<00:01:37.020> into<00:01:37.229> glucose<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.549> body

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
they turn into glucose and if your body

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.969 
they turn into glucose and if your body
doesn't<00:01:38.909> use<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> turns<00:01:40.500> them<00:01:40.740> into

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
doesn't use them then it turns them into

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030 
doesn't use them then it turns them into
fat<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.540> stores<00:01:42.780> them<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.380> your<00:01:43.530> body<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
fat and it stores them in your body as

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.870 
fat and it stores them in your body as
fat<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.600> okay<00:01:46.560> what<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> do<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
fat so okay what are you going to do you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
fat so okay what are you going to do you
need<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> eat<00:01:48.390> carbs<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.899> energy<00:01:48.960> into

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
need to eat carbs for energy into

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.069 
need to eat carbs for energy into
function<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> eat<00:01:51.810> too

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
function but you don't want to eat too

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.560 
function but you don't want to eat too
many<00:01:52.200> carbs<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> gain<00:01:53.340> weight<00:01:53.570> will

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
many carbs so that you gain weight will

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
many carbs so that you gain weight will
follow<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.200> rules<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.939> have

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
follow these rules and you will have

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
follow these rules and you will have
enough<00:01:57.390> energy<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.110> carbohydrates

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
enough energy from your carbohydrates

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.569 
enough energy from your carbohydrates
without<00:01:59.340> gaining<00:01:59.579> weight<00:02:00.350> only<00:02:01.350> eat<00:02:01.590> starchy

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
without gaining weight only eat starchy

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.660 
without gaining weight only eat starchy
carbohydrates<00:02:03.509> after<00:02:04.200> activity<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> after

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
carbohydrates after activity and after

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.749 
carbohydrates after activity and after
work<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> suggest<00:02:08.399> that
