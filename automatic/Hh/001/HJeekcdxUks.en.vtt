00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello friends with you your link and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.250
 Today, we are going to shoot top with heaven 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.740
 5 cool mechanisms us lime blocks and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.380
 now I want to show one as a bonus 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.710
 cool bug see but it was cubic in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.330
 arm 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
 if we turn around like this this block 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.220
 will again so that's cool illusion 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 It turns out actually enough 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.010
 let's not pull the cat by the tail and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 start watching video well, and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 fifth place we put here and sing 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.830
 cars have long been known to everyone but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 I used to show her before 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 Now you can ride ride way Batura 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.149
 got into the boat there is nothing complicated here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.129
 this is actually our engine and this is ours 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 Essentials Salon to Batu grew now I 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.440
 I will try to regret myself there 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.899
 vodka and pushes us well we can go 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 somewhere far away can be a series of flowed 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 rifle and leave for the edge of the world 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.750
 well, in principle, with fifth place, let's all 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.210
 watch fourth to fourth 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 the place we put here are you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 ballistic missiles do not know on th tuba 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 also they already had sex on batur 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 built us two copies and we 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.119
 let's try to blow up here uvat click 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 at the expense of three at the same time and see 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.509
 Whale agreement will fly faster and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 let's see what kind of destruction on the actual 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 bring let's poke one two three 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.650
 drove and the rockets brought up now will 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 kneading oh my god who leads the lead my 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.579
 rocket well in general they are on a par 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.390
 nothing can be said 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 and it went shit through the rocket pipes 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 connects with glass and come on come on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 it all started a warhead explosion 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 activated two rockets to you and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.100
 destruction such specific 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.460
 I'll tell you my rocket has inflicted more 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.680
 destruction therefore it is in principle possible 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.540
 always finish the go tour he is upset 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
 and all so put like that batur 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 not over not upset and on this guys 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.570
 with fourth place all let's watch 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 3rd place in third place we put I 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.460
 I don't know yet what 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.770
 batur now show us all and come on 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.260
 batory doing what and there wanted to do in 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.960
 In general, here we have a dispenser shoots 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.500
 arrows yet everything is fine everything is fine 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.850
 some arrows by the way fly by 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.400
 then the motor from i quit to the button 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:29.190
 spawn dynamite and bam and scatters 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 awesome this is not such a shotgun 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.720
 shotgun and arrows 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.450
 looked like a fight some mechanism I 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.310
 I think he really deserves 3 places I 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.770
 I admit I did spend more would have done 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 so here a little bit modernized here 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.800
 I hope enough power and see how 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 time let's see everything 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.310
 let go see how beautiful it all 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.020
 it works no she did not have enough power 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.880
 so basically everything is calculated here 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.510
 guys and batur let's last 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.550
 try to break the system so let's just 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.550
 floating a bunch-a bunch of arrows in general 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.760
 come on let's all I think will be enough 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.840
 let's say we have such a defeat zone 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.570
 from here from this angle we will see you 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.480
 just this one is so cool to me 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:29.130
 Like not in principle guys let's 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.500
 watch second place to second place we 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.390
 put here such a mechanism can not 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.519
 say why he is in second place 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.320
 they are on the third actually we him 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.660
 put us three place just because 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.239
 his prasad and he is very very simple 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.489
 done and principle works well 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.380
 let the batur poke please on the lever and 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.470
 actually you can shoot like this 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.680
 burning arrows there potions do not know 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.840
 animals on and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.239
 no platoons probably can not it you 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.230
 see how the earth flies some batura 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.150
 broadcast a product shot 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.829
 let's get here and catch 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.379
 actually you see some so heap 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.200
 fly but let's get here often on 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.150
 sometimes fly over somehow in boxing wears in 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.180
 overall it is not right in us and it 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.099
 really cool general here so how are you 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.680
 everything works i think this mechanism 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.509
 really deserves second place under 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.220
 batur generally just broke up 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.139
 shelling can know you do 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.729
 there is no lock 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.930
 such a goat is the way it is already enough 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.800
 cool looks well and actually 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.110
 let's watch the coolest gear 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.860
 well and the first place guys in front of us I 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.080
 honestly I don't know what's there 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.910
 batura prepared mechanism I don't know 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.560
 guys what will it be for me is it even 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.560
 will be a secret let's poke a button 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:54.099
 what the fuck is this my god 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:58.060
 really got scared it's just his 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.080
 who pinned everything clearly just 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.599
 will explode 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.400
 it's real it's cool it's easy 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.010
 awesome well and actually guys like that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.070
 was the first place I don't know this one just 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.880
 It was like this thing here and yes 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.310
 and she pushed out just like a command 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.260
 block is extinguishes general it is real 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.760
 it was cool if it was for the sound 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.919
