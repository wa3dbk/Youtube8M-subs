of contestants and amongst 12 people we

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.919 
of contestants and amongst 12 people we
think<00:00:57.730> strategy's<00:00:58.359> working<00:00:58.390> these<00:00:58.870> things

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
think strategy's working these things

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.209 
think strategy's working these things
like<00:00:59.289> what<00:00:59.499> you're<00:00:59.649> gonna<00:00:59.769> go<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.070> break

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
like what you're gonna go and break

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.889 
like what you're gonna go and break
someone's<00:01:00.550> prop<00:01:00.789> like<00:01:01.030> clearly<00:01:01.390> doesn't<00:01:01.659> work

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
someone's prop like clearly doesn't work

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.280 
someone's prop like clearly doesn't work
that<00:01:02.109> way<00:01:02.289> we<00:01:02.409> are<00:01:02.440> not<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:02.769> evil<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:05.170> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
that way we are not so evil I guess the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.050 
that way we are not so evil I guess the
only<00:01:05.470> strategy<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.280> hard<00:01:06.580> work<00:01:06.790> and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
only strategy is the hard work and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.720 
only strategy is the hard work and
that's<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.480> I<00:01:07.690> mean<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:08.250> guess<00:01:09.250> there<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.610> no

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
that's it I mean I guess there is no

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.100 
that's it I mean I guess there is no
other<00:01:09.820> strategy<00:01:10.000> if<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.450> ask<00:01:10.600> anybody<00:01:10.870> else

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
other strategy if you ask anybody else

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.450 
other strategy if you ask anybody else
and<00:01:11.200> if<00:01:11.290> they<00:01:11.410> have<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.560> strategy<00:01:11.890> please<00:01:12.220> tell
