00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
I am back with more sonic generations

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.009 
I am back with more sonic generations
showing<00:00:11.580> off<00:00:11.730> where<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> find<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.389> red<00:00:12.630> star

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
showing off where to find the red star

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.070 
showing off where to find the red star
rings<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.740> green<00:00:14.400> hill<00:00:14.580> zone<00:00:14.610> act<00:00:15.210> 1<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.870> that's

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
rings in green hill zone act 1 so that's

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.590 
rings in green hill zone act 1 so that's
the<00:00:16.529> very<00:00:16.770> first<00:00:16.859> zone<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> classic

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the very first zone with the classic

red<00:00:21.900> star<00:00:22.230> rings<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.699> are<00:00:23.820> red<00:00:23.970> star

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
red star rings now what are red star

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
red star rings now what are red star
rings<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.869> glad<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.230> asked<00:00:25.550> basically

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
rings I'm glad you asked basically

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.169 
rings I'm glad you asked basically
they're<00:00:27.090> red<00:00:27.869> stars<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.980> their<00:00:29.640> rings<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they're red stars and their rings and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.569 
they're red stars and their rings and
you<00:00:30.750> find<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.320> five<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.800> each<00:00:31.980> act<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you find there's five in each act of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
you find there's five in each act of
every<00:00:32.940> zone<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.200> hidden<00:00:34.350> some

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
every zone some of them are hidden some

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.709 
every zone some of them are hidden some
of<00:00:34.739> them<00:00:34.829> aren't<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.480> right

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
of them aren't and you can see one right

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.180 
of them aren't and you can see one right
there<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.739> look<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:37.920> that's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
there that's what they look like that's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.139 
there that's what they look like that's
number<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.329> act<00:00:39.989> 1<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.149> essentially

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
number one for this act 1 so essentially

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.690 
number one for this act 1 so essentially
every<00:00:42.960> level<00:00:43.440> has<00:00:43.469> five<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.460> find

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
every level has five of these you find

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
every level has five of these you find
them<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.450> unlock<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> bunch<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> stuff

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
them all you unlock a bunch of stuff

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
them all you unlock a bunch of stuff
artwork<00:00:46.829> music<00:00:47.160> all<00:00:47.640> sorts<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.059> things<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
artwork music all sorts of things and

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
artwork music all sorts of things and
you<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.140> an<00:00:49.200> achievement<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.649> finding<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you get an achievement for finding a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
you get an achievement for finding a
bunch<00:00:50.280> too<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:51.000> number<00:00:51.270> two<00:00:51.420> going

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
bunch too there's number two going

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
bunch too there's number two going
around<00:00:51.899> loop-de-loop<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.559> goes<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
around loop-de-loop just goes with you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.090 
around loop-de-loop just goes with you
there<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.469> thing<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> note<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
there so the one thing to note is that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
there so the one thing to note is that
these<00:00:56.579> red<00:00:56.879> star<00:00:57.090> rings<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.570> sometimes<00:00:58.469> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
these red star rings you sometimes you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.189 
these red star rings you sometimes you
can't<00:00:58.920> find<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.430> five<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> them<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.719> run

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
can't find all five of them in one run

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
can't find all five of them in one run
so<00:01:01.530> you're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> need<00:01:02.250> multiple

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so you're going to need multiple

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
so you're going to need multiple
playthroughs<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> level<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.680> all

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
playthroughs at the level to get all

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
playthroughs at the level to get all
five<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> red<00:01:05.670> star<00:01:05.880> raised<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:07.170> picked

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
five of the red star raised so we picked

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.480 
five of the red star raised so we picked
up<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.220> section

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
up the first two in the first section

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.480 
up the first two in the first section
and<00:01:08.760> after<00:01:09.150> doing<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.080> side<00:01:10.290> jump<00:01:10.619> take

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and after doing that the side jump take

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
and after doing that the side jump take
the<00:01:11.640> lower<00:01:11.790> path<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> thought<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.650> saw

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the lower path and here I thought I saw

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.830 
the lower path and here I thought I saw
something<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.400> saw<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.820> hiding<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
something or saw one hiding what the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
something or saw one hiding what the
Holy<00:01:15.990> okay<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> feel<00:01:16.409> nothing<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.310> under<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
Holy okay to feel nothing so under this

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.539 
Holy okay to feel nothing so under this
path<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.920> keep<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> keep<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> low

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
path here keep it keep it on the low

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
path here keep it keep it on the low
path<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.570> seeing<00:01:21.840> things<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
path I think I'm seeing things here I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
path I think I'm seeing things here I
don't<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.770> doing<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.869> stick

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
don't know what I'm doing here but stick

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.630 
don't know what I'm doing here but stick
to<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.049> path<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.549> eventually

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to this path and you will eventually

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
to this path and you will eventually
come<00:01:26.909> across<00:01:27.210> moving<00:01:27.960> swing<00:01:28.259> platforms<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
come across moving swing platforms and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
come across moving swing platforms and
there's<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> red<00:01:29.909> star<00:01:30.150> ring<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there's gonna be a red star ring in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
there's gonna be a red star ring in
between<00:01:30.780> after<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> loop-de-loops<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
between after the loop-de-loops here so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.810 
between after the loop-de-loops here so
that<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.780> number<00:01:33.960> three<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that would be number three and that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
that would be number three and that
leaves<00:01:36.000> only<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.600> go<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.979> last

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
leaves only two more to go but the last

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
leaves only two more to go but the last
two<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> found<00:01:38.850> were<00:01:39.090> probably<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
two that I found were probably the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
two that I found were probably the
toughest<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.619> I'll<00:01:40.740> explain<00:01:41.040> why<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
toughest and I'll explain why in a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
toughest and I'll explain why in a
second<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.049> number<00:01:43.320> three

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
second so right here is number three

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.940 
second so right here is number three
there<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> is

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
there it is

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.279
