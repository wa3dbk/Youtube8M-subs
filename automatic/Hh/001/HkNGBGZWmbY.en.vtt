think it's gonna be really cool the
reason<00:00:27.779> why<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.740> obviously

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
reason why I think that is obviously

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.470 
reason why I think that is obviously
because<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.460> huge<00:00:29.789> fan<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> Battlefield

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.749 
franchise I've been playing it for years
and<00:00:31.710> years<00:00:31.769> since<00:00:32.040> nineteen<00:00:32.430> forty-two

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and years since nineteen forty-two

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
and years since nineteen forty-two
obviously<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.950> think

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
obviously the game not the I think

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.920 
obviously the game not the I think
baffled<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> huge<00:00:36.210> flop<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.660> think

excited<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.280> am<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> baffled

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.830 
excited for it because i am a baffled
player<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> i<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
player so i think it's going to be a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
player so i think it's going to be a
very<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.229> good<00:01:19.409> combination<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.100> played

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
very very good combination and we played

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
very very good combination and we played
the<00:01:20.340> Alpha<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> beta<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> open<00:01:21.930> beta

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and closed beta and whatnot and all that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it so we all know that that's not the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
it so we all know that that's not the
point<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> point<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.799> about

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
point here the point is what about

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.580 
point here the point is what about
premium<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.509> premium<00:01:39.990> worth<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
premium now was premium worth it in

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
premium now was premium worth it in
terms<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> battlefield<00:01:41.310> 4<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> would

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
terms of battlefield 4 at first I would

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
terms of battlefield 4 at first I would
say<00:01:42.840> no<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> reason<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.220> core

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
say no the reason is because the core

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
say no the reason is because the core
game<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.030> broken<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.899> did<00:01:46.110> not

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
game was so broken that they did not

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
game was so broken that they did not
deserve<00:01:46.649> extra<00:01:47.009> money<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.640> another<00:01:48.060> service

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
deserve extra money for another service

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
deserve extra money for another service
I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> core<00:01:49.500> mechanic<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> core

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I think that the core mechanic the core

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
I think that the core mechanic the core
gameplay<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> pure<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:51.689> itself<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
gameplay just the pure game itself the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
gameplay just the pure game itself the
kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.649> base<00:01:52.799> game<00:01:53.040> should<00:01:53.310> work<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
kind of base game should work and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.160 
kind of base game should work and
function<00:01:54.030> properly<00:01:54.450> before<00:01:54.840> you're<00:01:55.140> even

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
function properly before you're even

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
function properly before you're even
allowed<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> put<00:01:56.009> any<00:01:56.219> other<00:01:56.399> content<00:01:56.820> out

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
allowed to put any other content out

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.130 
allowed to put any other content out
there<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.329> especially<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.869> you're<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
there and especially if you're going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.600 
there and especially if you're going to
charge<00:01:58.350> people<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> content<00:01:59.250> first<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
charge people for that content first of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
charge people for that content first of
all<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.360> standpoint<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.930> DLC<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
all you all know my standpoint on DLC I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
all you all know my standpoint on DLC I
think<00:02:01.740> DLC<00:02:02.070> should<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.310> completely<00:02:02.640> free<00:02:02.909> we

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
think DLC should be completely free we

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
think DLC should be completely free we
should<00:02:03.240> go<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> stage<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.290> called

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
should go back to a stage like in called

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
should go back to a stage like in called
you<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.070> where<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> developers<00:02:06.090> wanted

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you for where if the developers wanted

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.639 
you for where if the developers wanted
to<00:02:06.450> add<00:02:06.570> something<00:02:06.600> new<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> game<00:02:07.409> they

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to add something new to the game they

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.290 
to add something new to the game they
patch<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.099> game<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.610> added<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.119> for

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
patch the game and they added it in for

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.969 
patch the game and they added it in for
free<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.840> obviously<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> patch<00:02:10.410> kind<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.709> fix

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
free so obviously the patch kind of fix

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.589 
free so obviously the patch kind of fix
is<00:02:11.009> bugs<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> glitches<00:02:11.519> but<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.269> they<00:02:12.360> wanted

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
is bugs and glitches but if they wanted

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.089 
is bugs and glitches but if they wanted
to<00:02:12.659> add<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> weapon<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> map<00:02:13.500> they<00:02:13.860> could<00:02:14.040> do

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
to add a weapon or a map they could do

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.380 
to add a weapon or a map they could do
it<00:02:14.129> through<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> patch<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.180> shouldn't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.759 
it through the patch and we shouldn't
pay<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> penny<00:02:15.810> because<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.319> should<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
pay a penny because it should be the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.050 
pay a penny because it should be the
developer<00:02:16.980> saying<00:02:17.430> thank<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:17.940> buying

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
developer saying thank you for buying

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.789 
developer saying thank you for buying
the<00:02:18.239> game<00:02:18.390> supporting<00:02:19.049> us<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.379> keep<00:02:19.680> on

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
the game supporting us and keep on

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.289 
the game supporting us and keep on
playing<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.190> spreading<00:02:20.549> news<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.269> I

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
playing and spreading news about it so I

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.550 
playing and spreading news about it so I
think<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.840> should<00:02:21.870> go<00:02:22.049> back<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.379> time

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
think that we should go back to a time

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
think that we should go back to a time
like<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.739> however<00:02:23.519> obviously<00:02:23.970> kind<00:02:24.330> of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
like that however obviously kind of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.580 
like that however obviously kind of
business<00:02:24.690> strategies<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.200> whatnot<00:02:25.409> have

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
business strategies and whatnot have

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.050 
business strategies and whatnot have
changed<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.220> industry<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
changed the industry is not like that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.220 
changed the industry is not like that
anymore<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.480> they're<00:02:27.599> gonna<00:02:27.750> try<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.019> get

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
anymore so they're gonna try to get

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.449

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
including microtransactions so DLC is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.930 
including microtransactions so DLC is

always going to be paid for however in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400 
always going to be paid for however in
terms<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.239> battles<00:02:33.569> for<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.200> wasn't

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
terms of battles for I think it wasn't

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.530 
terms of battles for I think it wasn't
worth<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.799> at<00:02:34.920> first<00:02:35.129> but<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:35.910> because<00:02:36.420> I've

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
worth it at first but now because I've

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.140 
worth it at first but now because I've
played<00:02:36.690> about<00:02:37.040> 320<00:02:38.040> hours<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.519> battle<00:02:38.910> for

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
played about 320 hours of battle for

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.119 
played about 320 hours of battle for
which<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.450> ridiculous<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:40.260> think<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.829> got

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
which is ridiculous I think that I got

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.890 
which is ridiculous I think that I got
the<00:02:41.250> most<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.180> terms<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.720> money

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the most out of it in terms of the money

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.509 
the most out of it in terms of the money
act<00:02:43.079> was<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.620> bought<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.069> game<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.459> i

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
act was in so i bought the game and i

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.100 
act was in so i bought the game and i
bought<00:02:44.640> battled<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.150> premium<00:02:45.569> all<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.959> all<00:02:46.049> we

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
bought battled for premium all in all we

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.170 
bought battled for premium all in all we
came<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.410> about<00:02:46.500> 115<00:02:47.459> dollars<00:02:47.849> or<00:02:47.970> something

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
came to about 115 dollars or something

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.610 
came to about 115 dollars or something
like<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.299> hundred<00:02:48.629> ten<00:02:48.810> dollars<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.349> i<00:02:49.379> did

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
like that hundred ten dollars so i did

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.380 
like that hundred ten dollars so i did
get<00:02:49.769> my<00:02:49.890> money's<00:02:50.190> worth<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.299> time

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
get my money's worth now but at the time

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.849 
get my money's worth now but at the time
I<00:02:51.780> didn't<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.410> kind<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.709> an

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
I didn't so it's kind of like an

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.199 
I didn't so it's kind of like an
investment<00:02:53.099> but<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.579> terms<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.849> battlefield

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
investment but in terms of battlefield

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.699 
investment but in terms of battlefield
hardline<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.599> think<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.260> game<00:02:55.440> launches

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
hardline I think if the game launches

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.410 
hardline I think if the game launches
properly<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.519> launch<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.849> smooth<00:02:57.120> then

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
properly and the launch is smooth then

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.150 
properly and the launch is smooth then
premium<00:02:57.930> would<00:02:58.079> be<00:02:58.200> worth<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:58.799> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
premium would be worth it because the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.650 
premium would be worth it because the
game<00:02:59.310> works<00:02:59.579> everything<00:02:59.940> functions<00:03:00.450> you're

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
game works everything functions you're

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.759 
game works everything functions you're
going<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:00.930> fun<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.379> you're<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
going to have fun and you're going to

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.170 
going to have fun and you're going to
want<00:03:01.890> additional<00:03:02.129> content<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.819> keep<00:03:03.000> you

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
want additional content to keep you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.699 
want additional content to keep you
enticed<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.750> keep<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.079> playing<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.560> game

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
enticed to keep you playing the game

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.110 
enticed to keep you playing the game
more<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.129> more<00:03:05.250> however<00:03:05.640> if<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> game

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
more and more however if the game

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.759 
more and more however if the game
doesn't<00:03:06.150> work<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.959> doesn't<00:03:07.019> function<00:03:07.440> and

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
doesn't work if it doesn't function and

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.259 
doesn't work if it doesn't function and
if<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.160> flock<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.760> battled<00:03:09.120> for

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
if it's a flock just like battled for

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.699 
if it's a flock just like battled for
launch<00:03:09.569> which<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.900> doubt<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.290> would<00:03:10.410> be<00:03:10.560> because

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
launch which I doubt it would be because

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.410 
launch which I doubt it would be because
it<00:03:11.069> pushed<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> release<00:03:11.790> date<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.120> twice

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it pushed the release date back twice

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.330 
it pushed the release date back twice
now<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.959> think<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.500> they<00:03:13.799> obviously<00:03:13.920> working

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
now I think so they obviously working

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.920 
now I think so they obviously working
hard<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.849> making<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> game<00:03:15.389> function

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
hard to making the game function

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.390 
hard to making the game function
flawlessly<00:03:16.049> however<00:03:16.829> if<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.160> are<00:03:17.250> any

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
flawlessly however if there are any

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.860 
flawlessly however if there are any
problems<00:03:17.609> kind<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.000> major<00:03:18.239> game-breaking

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
problems kind of major game-breaking

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.559 
problems kind of major game-breaking
problems<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.739> my<00:03:19.919> suggestion<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.579> don't<00:03:20.970> pay

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
problems then my suggestion is don't pay

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.879 
problems then my suggestion is don't pay
them<00:03:21.720> any<00:03:21.810> more<00:03:22.049> money<00:03:22.230> obviously<00:03:22.739> you've
