00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Hello my friends with you and Vova 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.879
 is always 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.220
 and then I forgot the text because 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.360
 I drank coffee in general guys today 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.880
 on the review here is such a small 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
 a package wrapper from japan is pretty thin and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.699
 it is already written here that lies in it 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.760
 the whale is like a leopard written 3 dollars 84 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 cents that is chocolat whale 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 several who remember I wrote recently in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.789
 group vkontakte what I will do soon 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 A review on the kit-kat chocolate that you need 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.449
 bake 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.430
 here he is actually this person 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 so let's take a quick look here 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.309
 here is the address of the seller here is my address and here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 this top is written site bush of japan 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 dot com and I guys went in front of the review 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 to this site and I found a lot there and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.850
 Japanese nishtyakov that is, there are many 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.860
 any epanchin and and by the way they have 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 delivery to Russia I really have not yet 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 I looked at what's there at prices that how much but 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.699
 maybe I'm somehow 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.649
 I will order from this site and if more 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.899
 you will be lucky to somehow agree with them 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.300
 in general, let's actually open 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 our parcel from Japan and then I'm something 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 I chat a lot and by the way I will 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.150
 small parcels now open 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.229
 scissors because it is much more convenient 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 than open the knife I hope max well 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.600
 that dude who sent me the knife 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.439
 I'm offended that I will not open 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.460
 small parcels with a knife in general 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.170
 so what do we discover as crumpled and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.409
 by the way as you can see from me 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.659
 still the old fort me much longer 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.850
 Liked what that white one was 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.770
 previous reviews 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 so so now we look so i 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.210
 laid out so more empty so here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 here are 3 chocolates here are kitkat 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 small actually on ebay site i 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.570
 I will leave a link to this product in the description 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.899
 there they look a little different 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.909
 have they not like that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.259
 packaging they go in general they need 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.420
 I don't know how much time 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 the recording in the oven is therefore not particularly 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.140
 long because 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.140
 it is like chocolate and by the way me 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 need an oven warmed up for the price of that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.270
 for the price of these chocolates worth these 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 here are three things 180 rubles with free 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.910
 worldwide delivery proper 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.620
 freeshipping worldwide link 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.230
 I will repeat everything again in the description 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 Well, actually what to give whether I will post them 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 first on a little plate here to you again 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.270
 will show 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.710
 packaging is such a package is nothing 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.350
 remarkable that is forever all 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.170
 it is written in Japanese there is a break 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.740
 kitkat firms got 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:54.300
 Well, in general, here and so, so now I 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:56.580
 plate I'll take so shlekk actually 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.300
 chocolates whale cat some vanilla 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.880
 pudding but in general, as it were, they can be 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:10.890
 so simple there i think so well there was 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.750
 It is depicted that they need to be baked, I guess 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.010
 you know what made a chocolate bar 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.620
 leave her so boring 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.350
 and these are baking now and we will compare 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.360
 baked kitkat vanilla pudding and 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.940
 plain kitkat vanilla pudding 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.430
 Actually I will go bake now 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 you guys will be back soon oh well guys 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.600
 our chocolate and let's look at it 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.550
 baked closer here so here it is 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.520
 looks pretty good I'll tell you 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.290
 and it smells pretty good I baked it 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.380
 about four minutes at maximum 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.480
 power in the preheated oven here such 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.410
 Now here you are you closer kitkat we have 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.130
 I will bring such 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.709
 better to see such chocolate glasses 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.630
 well let's try it straight for me 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.020
 I wonder what it is for baked 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:07.070
 chocolate kit-kat from japan but what 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:07.070
 try I'll tell you fucking taste guys 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:15.750
 something like some waffles with 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.970
 something with pudding up damn I'm not even 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.970
 I know to describe how delicious it is. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.350
 this is probably the most 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.970
 delicious and unusual chocolate which I 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.770
 have tried 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.370
 sense he baked such but here 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.250
 look at the waffles and the top is sweet 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:49.889
 stuffing with pudding then there are such 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:54.610
 cool chocolate I do not know why we 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.800
 what he baked gives him more 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 of taste, that is, he is so straightforward 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.490
 I know saturated straight all awesome 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.120
 I don’t know a thing if I don’t feel sorry 180 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.040
 rubles as if order you will not regret well 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.330
 so to speak or a variety of interesting 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.500
 let 's try not prisoners now 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.380
 chocolate is ordinary that is like in 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.260
 comparison now show here so yes 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.940
 it's usually here baked but seemingly 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.460
 Of course baked looks more interesting 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.060
 than usual let's ordinary chirk him 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.060
 try 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:42.260
 but usually honestly as usual but 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.980
 also tasty yes usual that's not 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.680
 baked but this one 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.840
 more interesting tastier overall so here 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.710
