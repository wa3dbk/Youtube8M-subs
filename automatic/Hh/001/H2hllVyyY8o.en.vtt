hello this is McKean 25 and today I'm
showing<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.179> mechanism<00:00:03.389> for<00:00:04.049> my<00:00:04.259> lego

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470

showing you the mechanism for my lego
soda<00:00:04.770> machine<00:00:05.040> version<00:00:05.460> 2<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.850> cannot<00:00:06.450> show

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
soda machine version 2 I cannot show

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.320 
soda machine version 2 I cannot show
version<00:00:07.109> 1<00:00:07.290> because<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.099> used<00:00:08.550> version<00:00:09.030> 1<00:00:09.210> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
version 1 because I used version 1 to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.339 
version 1 because I used version 1 to
make<00:00:09.450> her<00:00:09.599> version<00:00:10.019> 2<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.849> yeah<00:00:11.849> as<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.990> all

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
make her version 2 so yeah as you all

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.560 
make her version 2 so yeah as you all
now<00:00:13.559> you've<00:00:13.860> probably<00:00:14.099> seen<00:00:14.429> action<00:00:15.120> before

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
now you've probably seen action before

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.599 
now you've probably seen action before
and<00:00:16.020> if<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.260> haven't<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.830> click<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> link

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
and if you haven't just click the link

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.790 
and if you haven't just click the link
right<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> ok<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
right here and so ok so this is how it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.890 
right here and so ok so this is how it
works<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.449> look<00:00:24.660> at<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> key<00:00:26.449> it<00:00:27.449> does<00:00:27.689> not

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
works so you look at the key it does not

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
works so you look at the key it does not
have<00:00:28.170> enough<00:00:28.439> length<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.949> push<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.699> soda

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
have enough length to push this soda

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.260 
have enough length to push this soda
down<00:00:30.210> see<00:00:30.779> no<00:00:31.439> soda

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
down see no soda

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.150 
down see no soda
so<00:00:33.270> then<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.660> take<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> quarter<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.950> just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so then you take a quarter and I just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
so then you take a quarter and I just
have<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.640> holder<00:00:36.300> per<00:00:36.989> quarter<00:00:37.350> I've

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
have this little holder per quarter I've

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.580 
have this little holder per quarter I've
glued<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.780> put<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> coin

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
glued it on and you put it in the coin

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.260 
glued it on and you put it in the coin
slot<00:00:41.629> then<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.469> pull<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.950> key<00:00:44.160> back<00:00:44.460> if

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
slot then when you pull the key back if

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
slot then when you pull the key back if
the<00:00:45.510> quarter<00:00:45.899> gives<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.649> soda<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.059> key

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the quarter gives the soda or the key

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.279 
the quarter gives the soda or the key
the<00:00:48.570> extra<00:00:48.960> length<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.930> yeah<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> your

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the extra length and so yeah and your

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.260 
the extra length and so yeah and your
soda<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:53.160> come<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.690> then<00:00:54.829> do<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> again<00:00:56.270> take

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
soda will come up then do it again take

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.450 
soda will come up then do it again take

on is an 8 by 24 um yeah and so if and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.600 
on is an 8 by 24 um yeah and so if and
then<00:01:58.710> you're<00:01:58.920> probably<00:01:59.100> wondering<00:01:59.520> about

then you're probably wondering about

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.120 
then you're probably wondering about
this<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.240> um<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> why<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
