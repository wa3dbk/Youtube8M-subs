sometime in the future anyway this is a
very<00:00:48.300> nice<00:00:48.839> model<00:00:50.120> very<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:51.180> detailed

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.389 

it<00:00:57.670> also<00:00:57.940> has<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.329> diecast<00:00:59.019> chassis<00:00:59.590> which<00:01:00.370> is

it also has a diecast chassis which is

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.340 
it also has a diecast chassis which is
very<00:01:00.730> nice<00:01:01.350> proto<00:01:02.350> max<00:01:02.649> couplers<00:01:03.900> he<00:01:04.900> also<00:01:05.080> has

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
very nice proto max couplers he also has

a<00:01:05.379> power<00:01:05.680> train<00:01:06.009> as<00:01:06.220> well

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.690 

Walter's<00:01:11.620> have<00:01:11.800> released<00:01:12.100> his<00:01:12.310> model

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
Walter's have released his model

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.260 
Walter's have released his model
sometime<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.420> past<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:15.460> believe<00:01:15.490> my

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
sometime in the past and I believe my

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.250 
sometime in the past and I believe my
oppa<00:01:16.630> has<00:01:16.780> one<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.290> first<00:01:17.530> one<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:19.660> what<00:01:20.229> I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
oppa has one of the first one and what I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.590 
oppa has one of the first one and what I
have<00:01:20.530> noticed<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.520> they<00:01:22.210> don't<00:01:22.360> work

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
have noticed is that they don't work

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.460 
have noticed is that they don't work
very<00:01:22.630> well<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.590> first<00:01:23.830> one<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:26.200> what<00:01:26.440> I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
very well the first one from what I

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.070 
very well the first one from what I
heard<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.130> second<00:01:27.729> or<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.660> release

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
heard the second or this release

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.280 
heard the second or this release
actually<00:01:30.070> runs<00:01:30.729> better<00:01:31.030> as<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.330> better<00:01:31.930> drive

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
actually runs better as a better drive

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.080 
actually runs better as a better drive
system

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.099 

they<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.810> done<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> rig's<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.710> nicely<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
they have done the rig's very nicely I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.419 
they have done the rig's very nicely I
had<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.320> careful<00:01:43.740> though<00:01:43.859> they're<00:01:44.100> pretty

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
had to be careful though they're pretty

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.220 
had to be careful though they're pretty
delicate

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.950 

it<00:01:48.800> also<00:01:49.010> comes<00:01:49.370> with<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.610> magnet<00:01:51.760> for<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:52.880> hook

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it also comes with a magnet for the hook

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.570 
it also comes with a magnet for the hook
I<00:01:55.049> guess<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.250> added<00:01:56.760> for<00:01:57.000> more<00:01:57.330> detail

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
I guess just for added for more detail

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.060 
I guess just for added for more detail
or<00:01:59.580> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> boom<00:02:01.650> it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
or you can actually use it the boom it's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.680 
or you can actually use it the boom it's
not<00:02:02.369> powered<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:06.180> move<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> but

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
not powered you can actually move it but

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.720 
not powered you can actually move it but
with<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.020> hands<00:02:10.160> basically<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> more

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
with your hands basically this is more

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.949 
with your hands basically this is more
for<00:02:11.940> show<00:02:12.150> than<00:02:12.450> anything<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
for show than anything that

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
for show than anything that
functionality<00:02:15.709> now<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.870> model<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.470> DC<00:02:20.390> not

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
functionality now this model is DC not

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.770 
functionality now this model is DC not
DCC<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.920> if<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> DCC<00:02:26.940> layout<00:02:27.300> it's<00:02:27.570> not

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
DCC so if you have a DCC layout it's not

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.250 
DCC so if you have a DCC layout it's not
going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.050> work

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.690 

basically<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> plan<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
basically when I plan to do in the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.250 
basically when I plan to do in the
future<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.450> get<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> decoder<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:36.200> now<00:02:37.200> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
future is to get a decoder for it now I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.699 
future is to get a decoder for it now I
have<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.370> decided<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:40.050> type<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.290> Dakota

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
have not decided on what type of Dakota

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.190 
have not decided on what type of Dakota
I<00:02:41.100> want<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.090> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.430 

thinking<00:02:46.890> about<00:02:47.100> getting<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.520> lens<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:48.440> maybe

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
thinking about getting a lens or maybe

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.720 
thinking about getting a lens or maybe
of<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.740> lock<00:02:49.950> sound<00:02:50.250> Dakota

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.940 

and<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.450> reason<00:02:56.810> being<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.290> want<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.739> either

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
and the reason being I want to either

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.820 
and the reason being I want to either
get<00:02:58.220> those<00:02:58.520> two<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:58.970> they<00:02:59.720> actually<00:03:00.110> run

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
get those two because they actually run

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.140 
get those two because they actually run
very<00:03:01.220> smoothly<00:03:01.870> after<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.170> sound<00:03:03.500> I'm<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:05.000> too

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
very smoothly after a sound I'm not too

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.970 
very smoothly after a sound I'm not too
sure<00:03:05.420> if<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:05.989> fit<00:03:06.200> sound<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> coder<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.069> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
sure if I can fit sound the coder in it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.600 
sure if I can fit sound the coder in it
let<00:03:09.980> alone<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.280> speaker<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.769> I'm<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.580> to

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
let alone a speaker but I'm going to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.430 
let alone a speaker but I'm going to
attempt<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.480> do<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.980> will<00:03:16.130> actually

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
attempt to do it and I will actually

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.220 
attempt to do it and I will actually
post<00:03:18.440> another<00:03:18.800> video<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.540> model<00:03:20.840> whether

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
post another video on this model whether

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.910 
post another video on this model whether
the<00:03:21.410> code<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.799> installed<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:23.530> have<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.680> small

the code is installed and have the small

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.949 
the code is installed and have the small
actually<00:03:25.370> running

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.790 

so<00:03:35.500> again

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
so again

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.500 
so again
this<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.370> American<00:03:38.910> crane<00:03:39.240> by<00:03:39.990> Walters<00:03:41.510> second

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
this is American crane by Walters second

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.960 
this is American crane by Walters second
release<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:47.060> once<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.300> get<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.900> Dakotas<00:03:49.970> like

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
release and once I get the Dakotas like

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.280 
release and once I get the Dakotas like
I<00:03:51.090> said<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.360> would<00:03:51.690> have<00:03:51.900> another<00:03:52.500> video<00:03:54.290> and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
I said I would have another video and

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.090 
I said I would have another video and
over<00:03:55.740> here<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:57.450> had<00:03:57.630> seen<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.230> locomotive

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
over here you had seen this locomotive

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:07.280 
over here you had seen this locomotive
before<00:03:59.730> that's<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.620> 7890<00:04:02.570> 131<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:05.930> if<00:04:06.930> you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
before that's the 7890 131 and if you

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.870 
before that's the 7890 131 and if you
have<00:04:07.380> seen<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.740> video<00:04:07.980> before<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.430> probably

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
have seen the video before you probably

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.400 
have seen the video before you probably
wondering<00:04:09.180> why<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.870> part<00:04:10.260> again

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.909 

reason<00:04:13.410> being<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:14.959> actually<00:04:15.959> ordered<00:04:16.410> another

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
reason being I actually ordered another

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.090 
reason being I actually ordered another
Dakota<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:18.079> now<00:04:19.079> before<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.560> had<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.890> cue

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
Dakota for it now before I had the cue

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.909 
Dakota for it now before I had the cue
aside<00:04:20.370> Dakota<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:23.340> mean<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.390> was<00:04:24.630> good<00:04:24.919> but

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
aside Dakota and I mean it was good but

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.060 
aside Dakota and I mean it was good but
I<00:04:25.980> didn't<00:04:26.190> quite<00:04:26.340> like<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.700> sounds<00:04:27.120> on<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.300> I

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
I didn't quite like the sounds on it I

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.970 
I didn't quite like the sounds on it I
have<00:04:29.070> contact<00:04:29.790> ASI<00:04:29.940> about<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.930> if<00:04:31.770> they're

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.620 
from model train stuff as I said that
correctly<00:05:14.490> it's<00:05:15.490> very<00:05:15.670> good<00:05:15.880> sight<00:05:16.150> have<00:05:16.540> a
