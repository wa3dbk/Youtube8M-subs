00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello friends of fast pedelecs 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.719
 Today I got a packet of the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.150
 company www is at x.com 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 included was a small blackbox the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 your pedelec something on the jumps 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.140
 help 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.330
 the performance is very professional 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 Also the description that is enclosed 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130
 is also very easy to understand 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.439
 very professional and the installation 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 makes it easy by her 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.960
 the little black box just over the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 original sensor of your pedelecs over it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 move with the little earring 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.120
 ensures a speed of 16 km h 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.760
 then the speed is divided by three 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 that means that you are theoretically up to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 that could be fast to 75 km / h 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.930
 we will test now 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.420
 for the sake of completeness, here's one 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.759
 mentioned that this tuning does not content 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 the traffic allowed 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.220
 that is to say that this june is only for 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.380
 sport purposes on private land or 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.380
 locked routes is allowed 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.119
 what I like about the tuning box of b 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.850
 e-bikes like is the simple one 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.909
 quick montage exactly it's so good 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.009
 quickly dismantled what I do not 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.350
 like a little bit, the exposed 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.390
 able to get ready for a mountain bike 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.880
 it happens in the forest 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.009
 that I caught one in there and there 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 It could possibly be in my opinion 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.759
 tear off 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.759
 otherwise a clear thumb up
