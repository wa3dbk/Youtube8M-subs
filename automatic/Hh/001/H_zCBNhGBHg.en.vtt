00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 and hello everyone with you elephant 500 I today 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.330
 tell you what to download first 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.670
 meaning in the game world of tanks is 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.059
 one tank to be pumped 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 necessarily and this comrades apt-1 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.939
 Klim-Voroshilov model 1 Soviet 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.769
 heavy tank is beautiful so general 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.080
 perfect for level five 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.840
 I generally think this is one of the most 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.330
 the best tanks of the fifth level if not 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.149
 he has the most gorgeous armor and she 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.040
 constantly ricochet but most importantly in 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.840
 this tank is of course the gun here 22 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.230
 millimeter fugasnit which blows down with 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.510
 first time hit as you can see to the other 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 if only I could see what armored 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 shoot her all my team and nobody 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.059
 he can't punch him right now I'm 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.600
 I'll probably take him away 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.840
 man took it ready in general is not 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 tank is just heaven on earth you can 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.770
 feel free to swing this tank he is just on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.479
 level five somewhere for the day two conclusions 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.530
 swing if you start from the first 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.110
 level but the trick is what if you him 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.409
 swing after those tanks that you 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 gone this tank will be for you like a tank 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 God just you in god mode will enter the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 games world of tanks 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.100
 you will bend kill from the first 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.700
 shots demolish the tower tear the tanks 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.009
 there was such a situation with me that I 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 fired with one projectile 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.079
 and at the tank I got both demolished 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 the caterpillars at once it was generally fun 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.119
 I felt like a tank 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 fell apart but he survived after 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.350
 first shot but this is no longer tenant 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.329
 he had both tracks were ruins 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 so what's happening here but this 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.240
 my usual fight on kv-1 well, that's not 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.250
 say so one of the most such 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.159
 boring their fights are not the most fun 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.619
 there are much more fun on him fighting only 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.300
 they are not always recorded from how we see 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.550
 here is a heavy visit 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.600
 here is the only minus of this tank 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.460
 that he is a fugassnit and when he shoots 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.420
 armored targets take a lot 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.670
 very few hp not armored targets he 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.330
 picks up the first time but this is a minus 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.700
 fugasnitsa just how to say it 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:37.620
 doesn't make him weak anyway shepherds 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.620
 and he picks up for every shot and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.720
 considering his armor is pretty hard 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.240
 punch most likely this heavy shoots 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.550
 Goldoy so he so very well 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.750
 breaks through 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 churchill his valor is some kind of weak 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.980
 I waited for the place until it was shot 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.440
 No, I did not have time to pick it up 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.660
 It turned out and who is some freak here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.950
 something captures well in general what else 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.420
 pluses how to say pluses plus and i'm 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.330
 principle listed good armor 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.660
 good gun powerful tank with good 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.670
 health minus speed is natural 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.610
 speed and visibility but it's at all 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.370
 heavy tanks so well tell you here 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.170
 really at the game if i go and meet 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 some medium 3 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.560
 heavy or some other 5 leveled 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.239
 there is a 34-ku I'm not afraid of him but when I 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.370
 meet someone I know you need him 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.480
 fear because as a schmallet 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.350
 fugabnitsy you pretty well take down exactly to 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.340
 T-34 example I kill on apt-1c 1 or with 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.920
 the second time he's the first time he's usually 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.590
 demolishes him all the harp that is and criticizes 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.080
 all who can be well and the second time at 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.330
 He finishes him well I'll go now to the base 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.330
 as we see our base is captured 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.769
 so churchill hid there somewhere in there 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.910
 corner horseradish understand days probably uni 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.860
 there will be every art in march two artes 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.470
 they are unlikely to have gone somewhere 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.270
 most likely here waiting for me so here 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.630
 one art drying from the first shot 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.630
 copier and year 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.430
 Well, kill the art from the first shot 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:35.060
 certainly not the coolest cool 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:37.340
 achievement so another drying two arts 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.470
 demolished as we see them on seize 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.650
 I hope our base a little knock in 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.710
 seizure of it though it is hardly possible of course 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.660
 there 2k you 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 Churchill against whom it is also not so 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.730
 cool but I already have three frags 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.850
 which is a good idea to try to capture their base 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:03.650
 if he successfully knock here about Churchill yet 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.800
 I climb one , but I think he'll blow someone away though 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.640
 not fact not fact they have hp equally 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.100
 Churchill recharge much faster 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:18.200
 no not demolished I need to take a stand 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.840
 such that this churchill is very well 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.340
 wouldn't kill me very quickly loan to here 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.510
 behind this tank for corpse i think he 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.510
 I did not even have time to give here 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.800
 hide here and I will wait for my 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:43.970
 the enemy here is one of the most important cons 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.670
 this slowness tank kv-1 so base 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.040
 we still grab no chili but we 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.680
 lost but I played very well 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.420
 do not think that such a tank is one of 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.330
 the best tanks that should be 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.370
