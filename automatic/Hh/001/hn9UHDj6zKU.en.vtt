00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
context is very similar to folders if we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
context is very similar to folders if we
kept<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.290> games<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.830> example<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> shows<00:00:53.640> all

games<00:00:57.629> label<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.519> can<00:00:59.610> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.790> think<00:00:59.850> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
games label so you can kind of think of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.820 
games label so you can kind of think of
labels<00:01:00.479> as<00:01:00.659> folders<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.650> do<00:01:01.799> in
