00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.910
 I've got an really interesting story story here really this is a funny one 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.139
 Fox News did headlines 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.509
 I do not know once an hour twice an hour and that they know they did a title they wanted 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.639
 Breaking News Headlines Lewis was that 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
 Sometimes books that will be put up for sale put a clip 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.330
 That is this is the use of boxing 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.080
 I do not know the anchor because there is no better Heather term now 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.740
 Talk about the book How Al Gore on the so-called global warming crisis 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.430
 Louis is for sale only a dollar check of it 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.270
 Also talk about the disturbing fact of former Vice President Al Gore 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.379
 There's a picture that's what's on Twitter right now you can see right here 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.480
 The price of this book shows the so-called global warming crisis 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.520
 Well it's Milton to just one dollar 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.190
 Her also branded and I super wonderful by 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.059
 Now I'm not exactly where this photo was taken but that Amazon is rumored 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.570
 I am on Amazon.com and the book instead sells about twelve dollars 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.000
 It's at 12 pak to buy 20 single use 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
 Because this is so pathetic until the first mall 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 Let's say it was unusual that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 Old books end up really cheap after a few years written let's say 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.720
 It was really unusual 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.700
 Is this really a title now is this what Fox News considers to be 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 [Headline] 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.920
 But let's look farther from the Lewis surface that is all to try to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 Al Gore's criticism 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 Because Sean Hannity's book in Let Liberty Bells 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.909
 It costs you a penny on the Amazon market 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.680
 Steve did not see the book of Mr and Missus 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850
 A happy brochure you can imagine buying anything very silly 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.930
 This thing is 99 cents you can buy it for 99 cents and 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.509
 Even if we go there is a long list of these one most interesting 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.729
 Is of course Sarah Palin 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.969
 I remember when Sarah Palin wrote this book goes rogue. 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.829
 There are more than fourteen centuries copies I love 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.920
 Copy the volumes of it on the Amazon 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 One is available each 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.660
 It seems that news is not urgent despite David Lewis I 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980
 I would not take one of those books if you gave me a hundred dollars 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.640
 II feels like in the case of having possessed anything by demons it's one of those books 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.970
 Yes I hate that little little Louis Pat Robertson for years has been talking 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.060
 About all things possessed by devils none of which we have any 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.379
 The evidence is in fact 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.410
 I would not book Sarah Palin's chance off that he was a money clip 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.910
 That I would actually think that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.330
 In the grand scheme of things on Fox News there were 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.410
 For even more silly headings so nest I'm happy here at least they're 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.060
 Mentionsed 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.430
 Al Gore has the first book but the right change and this is the most realistic 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
 The title we heard about Al Gore is climate 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.010
 The crisis in years is that Al Gore exists 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.849
 He has written a book that has cited the name of the book correctly 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.650
 Maybe this is actually one of the best stories boxes I think of it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.800
 I say without a doubt probably the best story
