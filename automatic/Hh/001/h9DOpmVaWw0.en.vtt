onions and then we add our shark the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.819 
onions and then we add our shark the
tracy<00:02:21.739> mentioned<00:02:22.159> is<00:02:22.310> dry<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.500> all<00:02:24.650> going

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
tracy mentioned is dry this is all going

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.130 
tracy mentioned is dry this is all going
to<00:02:24.920> cook<00:02:25.069> together<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.989> sort<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:28.750> reduce<00:02:29.750> down

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
to cook together and sort of reduce down

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.080 
to cook together and sort of reduce down
wilt<00:02:30.829> down<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.099> little<00:02:31.370> bit<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:34.579> now<00:02:34.790> we're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
wilt down a little bit and now we're

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.020 
wilt down a little bit and now we're
going<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.269> have<00:02:35.450> eggs<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.489> probably

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
going to have eggs and this is probably

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300 
going to have eggs and this is probably
the<00:02:38.599> trickiest<00:02:39.079> part<00:02:39.530> because<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.099> not

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the trickiest part because you do not

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.069 
the trickiest part because you do not
want<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.670> make<00:02:40.760> scrambled<00:02:41.090> eggs<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.930> don't

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
want to make scrambled eggs so you don't

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.899 
want to make scrambled eggs so you don't
want<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.290> move<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.560> eggs<00:02:42.680> around<00:02:42.859> too<00:02:43.700> much

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
want to move the eggs around too much

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.289 
want to move the eggs around too much
once<00:02:44.420> they're<00:02:44.599> in<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> pan<00:02:45.400> but<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.180> do

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
once they're in the pan but when I do

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.910 
once they're in the pan but when I do
this<00:02:47.629> I<00:02:47.690> do<00:02:47.959> want<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.349> make<00:02:48.470> sure<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.829> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
this I do want to make sure that the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.780 
this I do want to make sure that the
eggs<00:02:49.099> get<00:02:49.760> underneath<00:02:50.420> all<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:52.519> great

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
eggs get underneath all this this great

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.099 
eggs get underneath all this this great
chard<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.659> I<00:02:53.690> do<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:56.470> pour<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:59.569> eggs<00:02:59.750> in

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
chard so what I do is pour the eggs in

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.490 
chard so what I do is pour the eggs in
sort<00:03:00.889> of<00:03:00.950> all<00:03:01.129> over<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:01.519> place<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:03.019> then<00:03:03.260> just

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
sort of all over the place and then just

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.720 
sort of all over the place and then just
sort<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.680> move<00:03:03.829> everything<00:03:04.040> around<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.430> little

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
sort of move everything around a little

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.550 
sort of move everything around a little
bit<00:03:05.209> just<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.870> make<00:03:06.019> sure<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.349> it<00:03:06.440> gets

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
bit just to make sure that it gets

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.910 
bit just to make sure that it gets
underneath<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.190> chard<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.639> then<00:03:08.030> leave<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
underneath the chard and then leave it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.550 
underneath the chard and then leave it
watch<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.700> edges<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.329> sort<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.629> see<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.200> it's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
watch the edges to sort of see if it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080 
watch the edges to sort of see if it's
starting<00:03:12.859> to<00:03:12.950> cook<00:03:13.159> sort<00:03:13.639> of<00:03:13.730> look<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:13.970> little

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and the rest of the cheats so with my

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.680 
and the rest of the cheats so with my
oven<00:04:10.340> mitt<00:04:10.490> because<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.940> Panhandle<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.570> going

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
oven mitt because the Panhandle is going

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.930 
oven mitt because the Panhandle is going
to<00:04:11.750> be<00:04:11.870> really<00:04:12.110> hot<00:04:12.440> you<00:04:13.310> gonna<00:04:13.460> just<00:04:13.640> take<00:04:13.790> it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
to be really hot you gonna just take it

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.240 
to be really hot you gonna just take it
out<00:04:14.060> real<00:04:14.270> quick<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:15.500> can<00:04:15.530> see<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:15.950> that's

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
out real quick you can see that that's

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.280 
out real quick you can see that that's
