00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.190
 moin moin friends and sincerely 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.400
 welcome to another world of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.880
 tanks video guide this time to the topic 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.170
 Graphics settings because I will 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 hey asked regularly on my stream 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.109
 what do you have for graphic settings 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 because she does not think so 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.180
 tingling but acceptable for the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.279
 frames and for that reason with it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.230
 did not want to have to repeat every time 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 I'll make a video about it this time and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.429
 I'll just show you something 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 that are exactly for settings and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.040
 Although graphics, I have the graphics quality 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.710
 on custom three the edges 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 resolutions maximum screen resolution 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 19 20 times 10 80 frame rate 60 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 color filter from full screen mode literally 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.329
 vertical synchronization from image format 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 16 9 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.860
 edge smoothing out of sight fvw 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 Edge smoothing I can actually synonymous 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.620
 let on 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.160
 I'll do a fourfold 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.449
 edge smoothing infection does not always happen 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 here cs s virum eightfold on it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 I actually had that shit 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.049
 warm at some point but 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.939
 actually I use that already because it 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.159
 looks a little better 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.119
 then oh yes, if you do not have one 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340
 have great calculator then it could be synonymous 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.130
 make out again 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 In any case, I even have the field of vision 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 experience 120 da gama is ireland that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 you have to adjust yourself so go then 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 I on the tace there I have the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.159
 Graphics should be improved to standard 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.079
 to crash the result because I wait 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.700
 again until the next graphics engine 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.030
 I'll wait for the next update 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.439
 I look for texture quality 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.409
 Lighting quality shadow quality 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.630
 everything at the same minimum 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.610
 how quality additional effects to yourself 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.720
 additional effects with riflescope the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 is very important flora density out 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.130
 reworking from swept effects 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.540
 I also from navi gras in the riflescope 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.549
 I can not turn it on anyway 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.969
 then i learned the quality that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.950
 goes by margins mode only on low 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.240
 you have to improve order with it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 even more has but I have it too 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.459
 low water quality low is the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.890
 the dickel could do the dickel 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.260
 quality and excuse me too 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.110
 Object detail levels to maximum 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.349
 run quality low presentation 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.260
 Distance to maximum 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.480
 motion blur from dynamic 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.459
 change in the cvag effect quality too 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.099
 I can turn off tracks 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.360
 not in the mode I have that yes 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:38.700
 it was by and large and then 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:43.769
 sometimes to apply what now but one 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.239
 bit louder from yes that's a 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.780
 already to the graphic settings more 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.150
 I do not have 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.129
 nothing special highlight but I wanted 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.389
 just keep asking hey what do you have 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.159
 I do not like that for settings 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.290
 must always repeat here a short 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.019
 video then wish you much fun 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.120
 hope that it helped you and 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.889
 Keep it up until next time 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.090
 the stream or until the next video 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.090
 march good until then
