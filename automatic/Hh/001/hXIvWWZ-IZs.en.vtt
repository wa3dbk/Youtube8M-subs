00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.870
 how about session friends to have zero in 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.540
 this time I invite you to see my 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.809
 video number 43 review these two 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.260
 figures I'm going to make a comparison between 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.060
 the figures of amazing spider-man 1 and the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.440
 figure of amazing spider-man 2 good 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.440
 let's start with the review 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.370
 let's start with spider-man 1 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.320
 it has the head it rotates 360 degrees has 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.840
 mobility on the back however it is not 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.050
 nothing of the other world see down 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.920
 upwards 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.649
 has little articulation or limited in 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.270
 shoulders your biceps and your arms 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.160
 can inhibit the shoulders can rotate 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 160 degree 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.379
 this is the figure that I recently repaired 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.180
 has double articulation in the arm I'm going 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.949
 to move carefully because remember that 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.290
 this figure is a bit defeated has 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.520
 double articulation in the arms 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.649
 dolls spin they move forward and 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.530
 backwards it catches my attention 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.929
 of the detail of its triggers here in 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.869
 the doll I'm going to zoom in a bit so that 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.390
 do not get tired of appreciating it looks pretty 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.070
 the figure that causes is quite father 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.800
 much controversy because the suit is not 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.170
 It is as classic as spider-man 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 If you have good details you can see 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.580
 see here then the spandex marks 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.369
 good waist does not rotate his legs 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.890
 they can open up there their thighs rotate 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.780
 the 360 ​​degrees 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.450
 he has a double point of articulation in 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.900
 the knee and your feet see they have very 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.130
 good articulation down and towards 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.250
 above 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.860
 this right now that the plane where so 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.690
 could not be put like that and not in the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 good viana wall 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.980
 is a good figure the truth is that I 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.530
 It took a bit of work to get it and 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.050
 good and you saw that the figure 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.530
 here is let's see now to his 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.630
 brother of spider-man 2 as this figure 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.360
 we can already see his articulation of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.100
 butterfly in the back has very 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.380
 good articulation of the shoulders of 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.380
 done a little bit more than its predecessor 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.380
 the arm rotates the 360 degrees has the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.740
 biceps also that rotates where the point 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.290
 of articulation in the elbows his hand 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.450
 As turns just moves forward 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 and backwards this figure brings a game 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.070
 of hands that have this then the classic 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.490
 position to shoot cobweb one is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.000
 you can remove them just by pulling here and 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.530
 the soles change to me I like more with 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.450
 the fists closed because almost all 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.090
 figures of spider-man come or with the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.739
 Open hands or doing the expression 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.350
 of the TV that is thrown in will fight 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.780
 jets that's why I like it here in the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.630
 back has a little more mobility than 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.550
 your other real figure your waist if they rotate 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.320
 the 360 degrees 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.550
 the articulation of the pri is a bit 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.930
 limited the thighs and in the 360 degrees 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.260
 has a double point of articulation in the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.460
 knees your calves turn and your 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.850
 feet also have good mobility to 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.660
 difference from the other one that happened to me 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.240
 to do it we can see that this note we do 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.710
 they have got the sideways too 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.900
 they have the articulation that that's 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.860
 pretty good the same has his figure 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.800
 I was here 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.620
 The two figures also move watch 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.050
 the 15 centimeters looks a little bit more 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.850
 high the figure of amazing spider-man 2 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.430
 because it has to be a little bit 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.930
 face the head is a little bigger 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.420
 see but practically look the same 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.880
 the 215 centimeters meet the 6 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.340
 inches let's see on the part of 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.130
 back the two figures 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.739
 because both are fairly faithful to what 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.739
 which is what went to the figure or the one 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.420
 they were even in the movies this 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.710
 longer spider than the truth to me 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.400
 I really like it 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.190
 it's not the classic costume spider but 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.100
 well they kept that from the previous suit 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.740
 from spider-man 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.140
 Well, good friends, I hope you're 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 reviews have liked and encourage them to 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.090
 the two figures right now look yet 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.380
 You can find the figure of amazing 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.590
 spider-man 2 in all stores 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.260
 departmental and well I would 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.850
 dismissal of you this was my view 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
 number 43 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.130
 I send them the best vibes and 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.130
 happy collections
