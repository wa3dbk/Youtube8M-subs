it<00:01:09.540> stores<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> ether<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.470> never<00:01:10.560> really

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it stores in ether I just never really

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.240 
it stores in ether I just never really
could<00:01:11.789> get<00:01:12.149> it<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.380> yeah

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
could get it to actually like this yeah

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.499 
could get it to actually like this yeah
well<00:01:14.399> I<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.759> never<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.149> it<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> peg

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
well I can never really get it to peg

well I can never really get it to peg
into<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:15.899> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.350> didn't<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:16.979> bother

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
into well so I just didn't really bother

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980 
into well so I just didn't really bother
too<00:01:17.340> much<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.630> holes<00:01:18.750> there

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
too much but it's got some holes there

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.760 
too much but it's got some holes there
in<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.539> see<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:21.810> pegs<00:01:22.619> all

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
in it actually you can see it pegs all

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.130 
in it actually you can see it pegs all
right<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.340> does<00:01:23.460> come<00:01:23.729> loose<00:01:23.960> as<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.559

doors and these fall off these are our
bolts<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.390> fall<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.929> let's<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
bolts they fall pretty see let's put it

bolts they fall pretty see let's put it
aside<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.670> away<00:02:13.700> side

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
aside it's just get them away side

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.309 
aside it's just get them away side
stretch<00:02:14.910> come<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.540> these<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.110> pull

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
stretch come up and these we just pull

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.010 
stretch come up and these we just pull
off<00:02:19.470> these<00:02:19.620> tab<00:02:19.860> into<00:02:20.129> there<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.459> sauce

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.510 

and<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:27.170> up<00:02:27.290> here<00:02:27.320> we<00:02:27.590> want<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.830> loosen<00:02:28.250> this

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
and then up here we want to loosen this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:44.820 
and then up here we want to loosen this
here<00:02:30.130> pull<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.310> down<00:02:43.180> see<00:02:44.180> there's<00:02:44.390> that

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
here pull that down see there's that

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.020 
here pull that down see there's that
this<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.950> coming<00:02:46.190> apart<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.640> scene<00:02:46.820> over

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
this is coming apart at that scene over

00:02:47.030 --> 00:03:03.130 
this is coming apart at that scene over
there<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:48.050> will<00:02:48.350> loosen<00:02:48.560> up<00:02:48.770> there<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.750> then

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
there that will loosen up there and then

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.770 
there that will loosen up there and then
what<00:03:03.320> happens<00:03:03.590> is<00:03:03.770> this<00:03:04.330> part<00:03:05.330> here<00:03:05.390> where

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
what happens is this part here where

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.270 
what happens is this part here where
normally<00:03:06.320> its<00:03:06.410> position<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:06.980> car<00:03:07.160> mode

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
normally its position here in car mode

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:36.490 
normally its position here in car mode
it<00:03:07.430> flies<00:03:07.730> forward<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.150> that<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:36.140> again<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
it flies forward like that and again the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.810 
it flies forward like that and again the
reason<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.830> moves<00:03:37.070> down<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.670> have

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
reason that moves down is that you have

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.310 
reason that moves down is that you have
enough<00:03:37.940> clearance<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.360> get<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.660> arm<00:03:38.810> out<00:03:38.959> and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
enough clearance to get the arm out and

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.259 
enough clearance to get the arm out and
rotate<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:45.280> if<00:03:46.280> not<00:03:46.610> it's<00:03:46.820> going<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.000> hold<00:03:47.180> it

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
rotate it if not it's going to hold it

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.509 
rotate it if not it's going to hold it
down<00:03:47.440> as<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.680> road<00:03:48.860> hitting<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.280> get<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
down as the road hitting so you get the
