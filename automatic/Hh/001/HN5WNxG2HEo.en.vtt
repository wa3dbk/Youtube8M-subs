they<00:02:13.470> show<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.739> what<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> stock<00:02:14.640> thermal

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.629 
they did say it would apply easily just
get<00:04:29.920> an<00:04:30.010> idea<00:04:30.340> how<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.790> spreads

it<00:04:35.150> doesn't<00:04:35.509> stick<00:04:35.749> very<00:04:35.960> well<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.319> paper<00:04:36.560> of

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
it doesn't stick very well the paper of

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.270 
it doesn't stick very well the paper of
course<00:04:37.150> but<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:39.229> gives<00:04:39.379> you<00:04:39.530> an<00:04:39.590> idea<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:40.039> how

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
course but it gives you an idea of how

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.390 
course but it gives you an idea of how
smooth<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.849> is<00:04:40.879> and<00:04:41.439> it<00:04:42.439> is<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.650> very<00:04:42.740> dense

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
smooth it is and it is a very dense

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.179 
smooth it is and it is a very dense
paste<00:04:43.990> not<00:04:44.990> like<00:04:45.199> some<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.499> the<00:04:45.590> runny<00:04:45.800> stuff

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:46.189 
paste not like some of the runny stuff

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:47.950 
paste not like some of the runny stuff
that<00:04:46.430> we've<00:04:46.639> seen<00:04:46.909> from<00:04:46.939> some<00:04:47.749> of<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> other

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
that we've seen from some of the other

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.320 
that we've seen from some of the other
manufacturers<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.669> looks<00:04:49.879> like<00:04:49.939> it<00:04:50.180> will

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
manufacturers so it looks like it will

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.379 
manufacturers so it looks like it will
really<00:04:50.689> stick<00:04:51.349> in<00:04:51.560> place<00:04:52.090> we're<00:04:53.090> going<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.300> do

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
really stick in place we're going to do

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.950 
really stick in place we're going to do

just some over-the-counter paste with
the<00:05:00.710> DX<00:05:01.039> for<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.520> see<00:05:01.669> what<00:05:01.849> a<00:05:01.879> difference<00:05:02.270> it

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419

just<00:05:13.580> going<00:05:13.699> to<00:05:13.729> use<00:05:13.909> our<00:05:14.650> high-speed<00:05:15.650> pc<00:05:16.490> top

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
just going to use our high-speed pc top

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.830 
just going to use our high-speed pc top
deck<00:05:17.479> tech<00:05:18.169> station<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:19.610> run<00:05:20.180> our<00:05:20.360> casts<00:05:20.719> on

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
deck tech station to run our casts on

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.360 
deck tech station to run our casts on
that<00:05:21.139> way<00:05:21.259> we<00:05:21.409> know<00:05:21.439> it's<00:05:21.710> got<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:21.889> good<00:05:22.099> airflow

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
that way we know it's got a good airflow

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.019 
that way we know it's got a good airflow
we<00:05:22.819> can't<00:05:23.060> blame<00:05:23.569> a<00:05:23.629> case<00:05:23.960> for<00:05:24.379> not<00:05:25.310> getting

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
we can't blame a case for not getting

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.079 
we can't blame a case for not getting
good<00:05:26.210> ratings<00:05:26.860> we<00:05:27.860> have<00:05:28.039> our<00:05:28.219> CPU<00:05:28.699> cleaned

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:29.089 
good ratings we have our CPU cleaned

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:31.679 
good ratings we have our CPU cleaned
thoroughly<00:05:29.360> as<00:05:29.810> well<00:05:30.020> as<00:05:30.199> our<00:05:30.409> stock<00:05:30.830> cooler

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 
thoroughly as well as our stock cooler

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.610 
thoroughly as well as our stock cooler
this<00:05:32.689> is<00:05:32.900> lapped<00:05:33.259> cpu<00:05:33.860> saudi<00:05:34.520> intel<00:05:35.270> pentium<00:05:36.169> d

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
this is lapped cpu saudi intel pentium d

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.019 
this is lapped cpu saudi intel pentium d
820<00:05:38.319> so<00:05:39.319> that<00:05:39.529> way<00:05:39.650> we'll<00:05:39.800> have<00:05:39.949> good<00:05:40.159> copper

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
820 so that way we'll have good copper

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.010 
820 so that way we'll have good copper
run<00:05:41.210> copper<00:05:42.400> conductivity<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:43.969> for<00:05:44.960> the

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
run copper conductivity and for the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.749 
run copper conductivity and for the
first<00:05:45.259> test<00:05:45.500> we're<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:45.949> going<00:05:46.129> to<00:05:46.189> try<00:05:46.430> some

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
first test we're just going to try some

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.360 
first test we're just going to try some
of<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:46.969> over<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.449> counter<00:05:48.250> actually<00:05:49.250> this

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
of this over the counter actually this

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.119 
of this over the counter actually this
is<00:05:49.550> from<00:05:49.789> radio<00:05:50.479> shack<00:05:50.620> this<00:05:51.620> is<00:05:51.830> some<00:05:52.009> of

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
is from radio shack this is some of

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.439 
is from radio shack this is some of
their<00:05:52.250> CPU<00:05:53.060> compound<00:05:54.020> so<00:05:55.009> let's<00:05:55.819> try<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.300> and

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
their CPU compound so let's try that and

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.029 
their CPU compound so let's try that and
see<00:05:56.509> what<00:05:56.599> kind<00:05:56.779> of<00:05:56.899> temperature<00:05:57.289> we<00:05:57.439> get<00:05:57.589> okay

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
see what kind of temperature we get okay

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.499 
see what kind of temperature we get okay
we're<00:05:58.250> going<00:05:58.339> to<00:05:58.399> run<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.639> couple<00:05:58.879> of<00:05:59.120> tests

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
we're going to run a couple of tests

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.980 
we're going to run a couple of tests
here<00:05:59.860> we're<00:06:00.860> going<00:06:00.949> to<00:06:01.039> run<00:06:01.159> it<00:06:01.339> at<00:06:01.460> idle

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
here we're going to run it at idle

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.260 
here we're going to run it at idle
temperature<00:06:02.990> which<00:06:03.860> has<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.550> right<00:06:04.909> now<00:06:05.089> is

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
temperature which has a right now is

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.619 
temperature which has a right now is
about<00:06:05.479> 50<00:06:05.930> 51<00:06:06.319> degrees<00:06:06.649> on<00:06:07.219> the

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:07.629 
about 50 51 degrees on the

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.839 
about 50 51 degrees on the
over-the-counter<00:06:08.629> thermal<00:06:09.439> base<00:06:09.649> and<00:06:10.129> we're

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
over-the-counter thermal base and we're

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.600 
over-the-counter thermal base and we're
also<00:06:11.000> going<00:06:11.360> to<00:06:11.509> run<00:06:12.050> a<00:06:12.080> mode<00:06:12.770> cast<00:06:13.129> on<00:06:13.399> it<00:06:13.580> and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
also going to run a mode cast on it and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.220 
also going to run a mode cast on it and
to<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.509> temperatures<00:06:15.110> do<00:06:15.289> at<00:06:15.469> low

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
to the temperatures do at low

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.430 
to the temperatures do at low
see<00:06:18.230> a<00:06:18.260> drop<00:06:18.620> down<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:19.010> about<00:06:19.190> 49<00:06:20.150> now<00:06:20.510> so<00:06:20.870> we'll

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
see a drop down to about 49 now so we'll

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.620 
see a drop down to about 49 now so we'll
use<00:06:21.620> that<00:06:21.650> as<00:06:22.070> our<00:06:22.280> baseline<00:06:22.940> for<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.450> deck

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
use that as our baseline for the deck

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.620 
use that as our baseline for the deck
okay<00:06:24.560> we've<00:06:24.740> been<00:06:24.920> running<00:06:25.130> prime95<00:06:26.030> for<00:06:26.600> a

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
okay we've been running prime95 for a

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.010 
okay we've been running prime95 for a
few<00:06:26.810> minutes<00:06:27.020> on<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:28.420> cpu<00:06:29.420> with<00:06:29.780> the

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
few minutes on the cpu with the

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.050 
few minutes on the cpu with the
over-the-counter<00:06:30.740> paste<00:06:31.250> and<00:06:31.610> as<00:06:31.730> you<00:06:31.880> can

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
over-the-counter paste and as you can

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.420 
over-the-counter paste and as you can
see<00:06:32.090> our<00:06:32.590> thermal<00:06:33.590> temperatures<00:06:34.070> are<00:06:34.340> above

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
see our thermal temperatures are above

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.260 
see our thermal temperatures are above
72<00:06:35.390> 73<00:06:35.990> degrees<00:06:36.560> under<00:06:36.860> law<00:06:37.130> so<00:06:38.030> we're<00:06:38.180> going

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
72 73 degrees under law so we're going

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.150 
72 73 degrees under law so we're going
to<00:06:38.390> shut<00:06:38.570> it<00:06:38.690> down<00:06:38.720> let<00:06:39.290> it<00:06:39.320> cool<00:06:39.590> off<00:06:39.650> and

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
to shut it down let it cool off and

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.420 
to shut it down let it cool off and
switch<00:06:40.490> over<00:06:40.670> to<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:41.180> tunic<00:06:41.720> ex4<00:06:42.530> okay<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.190> just

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
switch over to the tunic ex4 okay I just

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.800 
switch over to the tunic ex4 okay I just
want<00:06:43.580> to<00:06:43.610> take<00:06:43.730> a<00:06:43.790> shot<00:06:43.880> of<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.300> cooler<00:06:44.600> after

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
want to take a shot of the cooler after

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.570 
want to take a shot of the cooler after
I<00:06:45.050> took<00:06:45.140> it<00:06:45.440> off<00:06:45.530> just<00:06:45.890> so<00:06:46.040> you<00:06:46.130> can<00:06:46.280> see<00:06:46.550> that

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
I took it off just so you can see that

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.630 
I took it off just so you can see that
it<00:06:46.910> had<00:06:47.230> good<00:06:48.230> dispersion<00:06:48.740> of<00:06:49.070> the<00:06:49.130> thermal

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
it had good dispersion of the thermal

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.660 
it had good dispersion of the thermal
paste<00:06:49.880> so<00:06:50.210> we<00:06:50.680> know<00:06:51.680> that<00:06:51.710> the<00:06:52.070> thermal<00:06:52.460> paste

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
paste so we know that the thermal paste

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.580 
paste so we know that the thermal paste
was<00:06:52.880> making<00:06:53.240> good<00:06:53.390> contact<00:06:53.930> now<00:06:54.350> we're<00:06:54.500> going

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
was making good contact now we're going

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.660 
was making good contact now we're going
to<00:06:54.650> clean<00:06:54.920> it<00:06:55.070> off<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:55.550> switch<00:06:55.790> to<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.150> TX<00:06:56.480> for

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
to clean it off and switch to the TX for

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.070 
to clean it off and switch to the TX for
now<00:06:58.670> for<00:06:58.910> the<00:06:59.000> idol<00:06:59.300> temperature<00:06:59.810> on<00:07:00.050> the

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
now for the idol temperature on the

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.270 
now for the idol temperature on the
tunic<00:07:00.590> TX<00:07:01.130> 4<00:07:01.900> we're<00:07:02.900> idling<00:07:03.350> at<00:07:03.500> about<00:07:03.770> 45

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
tunic TX 4 we're idling at about 45

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.880 
tunic TX 4 we're idling at about 45
degrees<00:07:04.310> so<00:07:05.000> we<00:07:05.030> gained<00:07:05.360> a<00:07:05.480> few<00:07:05.690> degrees<00:07:06.350> on

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
degrees so we gained a few degrees on

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.990 
degrees so we gained a few degrees on
Idol<00:07:07.700> with<00:07:08.540> the<00:07:08.810> tuning<00:07:09.500> pace<00:07:09.770> now<00:07:10.670> let's

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.780 
Idol with the tuning pace now let's
start<00:07:11.900> up<00:07:12.050> prime95<00:07:12.620> and<00:07:13.280> see<00:07:13.430> what<00:07:13.580> it<00:07:13.670> does

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
start up prime95 and see what it does

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.580 
start up prime95 and see what it does
under<00:07:14.120> load<00:07:14.330> okay<00:07:14.960> we've<00:07:15.200> been<00:07:15.230> running
