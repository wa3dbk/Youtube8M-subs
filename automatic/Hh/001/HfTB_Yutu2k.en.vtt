00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello dear friends in touch 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.919
 michael temple in this video we'll talk 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.170
 about promotion for the photographer principle 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.599
 the anthill will be you a stranger 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 many began to make a small excursion into 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.039
 previous post on my blog we 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.650
 discussed bad tips that give 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.390
 photographer now but words about rain 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 Now the Internet is simply cluttered 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 information on the promotion of this information 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 not always applicable 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.410
 instantly I will give an example of several 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.620
 such military advice well, for example now 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'm not lying, it's not a secret that all photographers 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.710
 strive to make word of mouth and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 everywhere put on blogs write about it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 on the one hand it is absolutely 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.789
 the right to do so is necessary but what harm 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.590
 this advice is harm this advice is that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 the photographers themselves are often wrong 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.110
 perceive this advice that is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.719
 word of mouth if you talk more 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.449
 competent marketing it only doubles 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.879
 your thread is valid if you have 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 client yes and you use word of mouth 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 radio stimulate there let's say after 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.049
 shooting ask him for recommendations 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 Beijing player friends for a bonus before he 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.000
 can just multiply let's say 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.220
 double but what's the harm here 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.170
 is that it is necessary that would have to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
 so that the photographer principle does not have 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.770
 these stable order meaning you must 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 clearly understand that word of mouth 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 sundresses marketing is a way of doubling 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 but not the way of the main promotion often 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.810
 and the blues and promised yes all need to force 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 constantly force this here so people 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.380
 gave you these recommendations 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 well, most of this is self-serving here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.439
 here it is the creator is the first further 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 now well literally there every finger that 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.210
 the photographer needs a VKontakte group 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.659
 and that's when we are from good workshop and we 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.439
 it comes to cutting 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.960
 who as spins but there is a website or 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.729
 there vkontakte group that with this site 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.969
 leaflet is made to one VKontakte group 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.829
 incomprehensible and the harm here is not that 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.689
 it is not necessary to do but what is necessary 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.560
 do wisely friends and today we are with you 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.409
 let's talk about it 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
 she is with you today the topic is the principle 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.330
 anthill means it is a technique that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.700
 I give my students today to you madam 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.410
 It is with examples well, for starters, see 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 what is the principle of the anthill in general but 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.680
 imagine clusters here 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.890
 anthill to the righteous and congregation 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.620
 your target audience for example and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.959
 let's say she's from my students a cate 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.060
 business specifically on this principle 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.549
 made four weeks 160 thousand rubles 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.209
 first on auto shoot what she did 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.470
 she found such a level and 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.310
 partners with them 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 be an anthill it can be 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.069
 cafe-restaurant it can be a lounge 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.170
 beauty is completely calm it can 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.630
 be a fitness club that is it can be 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.970
 any place where your target is 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.980
 the audience and you essentially not necessarily 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.170
 to be first time specialists 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.310
 promotion to be able to set contextual 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.230
 advertising and go into the subtleties of those or 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.760
 other sites to start to master this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.700
 principle was possible to use 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.799
 almost any site so my 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.720
 pupils come but ordinary any 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.540
 organization agree on partnership 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.150
 for taking pictures there let's say interior in 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.030
 salons 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.769
 and you can agree on your 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.480
 Coupon interfered on tape made my 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.670
 pupil to do this with the Children's Center 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.120
 let's say it can be a kindergarten and to 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.450
 child photographer 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.859
 You can follow this kindergarten and agree 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.299
 have your coupon lying there and do 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.129
 made very very go stalemate 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.470
 almost immediately received the first 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.819
 order from this site yes yes it is clear that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.180
 there are some subtleties 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.859
 it is a principle up to what can be done at all 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.780
 in this principle the anthill itself 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.420
 simple let's say this is what is honest 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.909
 wrote this offline example 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.220
 offline there when you're not online 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.379
 spun the principle of the anthill can 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.629
 the simplest I would even be the dumbest 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.900
 his use of it can make social 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.180
 networks when the photographer is told that we are 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.280
 spins on VK and how 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.629
 it was not clear the most simple I 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.409
 Now vkontakte promotion what is 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.879
 is to order a post ant public or 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.130
 groups there already have your target 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.889
 audience in your region that is 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.239
 Essentially you need if you want to take 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.150
 anthill government himself his 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.570
 simple version on the internet you find 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.610
 they sell an anthill this is public 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.680
 photo shoots for girls who is there can 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.630
 it should be some kind of public 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.099
 bachelorette party find where you hang out 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.889
 your target audience so that it will be 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.050
 your region get into jupiter you 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.370
 find such a public you need 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.490
 negotiate with their administrator 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.000
 write a message he leaves the stage 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.250
 your post in this post you throw there 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.110
 share it is clear that you need to be able to write 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.910
 stock sold drying needed marketing 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.949
 what is needed preferably selling site 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.139
 can be displayed on the page in contact 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.570
 but nevertheless it is also good 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.400
 work so apply the principle 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.310
 anthill friends know where to hang out 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.790
 your stream audience your task is just 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.400

 daily contact then you have 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.250
