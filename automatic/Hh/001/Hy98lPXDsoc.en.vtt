00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

emboss<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.330> now<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> course<00:01:57.810> he<00:01:57.990> thinks<00:01:58.289> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
emboss and now of course he thinks I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.039 
emboss and now of course he thinks I
should<00:01:58.560> heat<00:01:58.740> emboss<00:01:58.860> everything<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.750> next

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
should heat emboss everything the next

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
should heat emboss everything the next
step<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.500> erase<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.159> lines<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> card

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

one<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.610> could<00:02:05.879> use<00:02:06.030> red<00:02:06.300> powder<00:02:06.569> I<00:02:06.979> suggested

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
one I could use red powder I suggested

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770

doing<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.640> red<00:02:08.879> nose<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> reindeer

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> decided<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.599> along<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.110> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so I decided to go along with it I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.559 
so I decided to go along with it I
didn't<00:02:14.310> use<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.640> embossing<00:02:14.940> bag<00:02:15.269> this<00:02:15.510> time

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
didn't use the embossing bag this time

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.449 
didn't use the embossing bag this time
so<00:02:16.110> small<00:02:16.470> brush<00:02:16.709> came<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.129> handy<00:02:17.310> for

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so small brush came in handy for

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.880 
so small brush came in handy for
removing<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.120> stray<00:02:18.360> specs<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.620> Rouge
