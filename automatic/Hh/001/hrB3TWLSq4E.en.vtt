00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.929
 hi guys today i will show you how 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.259
 make the volume of the bullet that you asked 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.259
 yes our short hair went and 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.600
 first we separate the top 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:34.530
 hair 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:39.350
 and on the lower back of the hair we 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.379
 begin to weave a spike bottom up 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 not just doing this 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.539
 be upset if you fail 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.550
 from the first try several times 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.550
 and you will succeed 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:04.170
 and the secret is that the hair is on top 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.810
 we are long the main thing to collect and 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.390
 hairs that connect them down to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.420
 top hair so that you can 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.420
 make a normal volume bundle 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.130
 we fix a spike with a rubber strap also if 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.399
 we got the lower beds in the air 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.179
 raise them to the top and twist in 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.030
 spikelet 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:44.030
 fixing with a stud or 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.619
 invisible now connect the top 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.349
 hair piece 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:56.319
 our spikelet and of course do not forget 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:56.319
 comb your hair in front 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.500
 just pull up supposedly careless 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.500
 pryadochki on both sides 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 separate the hair strand and make small 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.780
 bouffant 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.069
 and twist in the middle fixing with 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.069
 help invisible 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.000
