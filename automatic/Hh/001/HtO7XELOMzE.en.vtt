00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.140 
that but overall the toe box here has a
pretty<00:02:26.040> good<00:02:26.130> shape<00:02:26.460> i<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
pretty good shape i think on the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.810 
pretty good shape i think on the
countdown<00:02:27.480> packs<00:02:27.900> look<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> boat

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
countdown packs look kind of like a boat

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.120 
countdown packs look kind of like a boat
the<00:02:30.150> whole<00:02:30.180> shoe<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.810> felt<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.710> part<00:02:31.830> was

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the whole shoe I felt like this part was

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.510 
the whole shoe I felt like this part was
way<00:02:32.340> too<00:02:32.400> long<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.890> wasn't<00:02:34.890> quite<00:02:35.040> rounded

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
way too long and wasn't quite rounded

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.680 
way too long and wasn't quite rounded
enough<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.570> would<00:02:36.660> see<00:02:36.810> these<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.690> show
