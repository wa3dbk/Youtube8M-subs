basically<00:00:19.500> kind<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> story<00:00:20.130> started<00:00:20.789> with

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
basically kind of the story started with

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.080 
basically kind of the story started with
dokucraft<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:22.080> Creator<00:00:22.470> Doku<00:00:22.890> he<00:00:23.730> had<00:00:23.820> also

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
dokucraft the Creator Doku he had also

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.960 
dokucraft the Creator Doku he had also
dokuz<00:00:24.570> RPG<00:00:25.109> texture<00:00:25.619> pack<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.400> he<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
dokuz RPG texture pack but he kind of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
dokuz RPG texture pack but he kind of
like<00:00:27.119> faded<00:00:27.449> off<00:00:27.779> from<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> Minecraft

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
like faded off from the Minecraft

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
like faded off from the Minecraft
community<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.179> people<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.630> been

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
community and so people have been

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.350 
community and so people have been
keeping<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> alive<00:00:31.949> by<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
keeping it alive by you know kind of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060 
keeping it alive by you know kind of
replicating<00:00:33.989> his<00:00:34.110> work<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> improving<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
replicating his work and improving it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
replicating his work and improving it
and<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.809> texture<00:00:37.140> pack<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and so I think this texture pack is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.600 
and so I think this texture pack is
pretty<00:00:37.590> sweet<00:00:37.710> they've<00:00:37.980> done<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.219> awesome<00:00:38.370> job

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pretty sweet they've done an awesome job

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.260 
pretty sweet they've done an awesome job
with<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.719> HD<00:00:40.190> 32<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:41.309> 32<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
with it it is HD 32 by 32 which can be a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
with it it is HD 32 by 32 which can be a
good<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.469> bad<00:00:43.500> thing<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> same

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
good thing and a bad thing at the same

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.760 
good thing and a bad thing at the same
time<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.670> good<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
time a good thing because it is kind of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.709 
time a good thing because it is kind of
cool<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.700> better<00:00:47.910> textures<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
cool to have better textures but it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
cool to have better textures but it
might<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.320> run<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.700> keep<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
might not run as well so keep that in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.569 
might not run as well so keep that in
mind<00:00:51.739> here<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> walking<00:00:53.340> around

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
stuff you can see i think this is pretty

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
stuff you can see i think this is pretty
sweet<00:01:00.120> i'll<00:01:00.420> definitely<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:00.989> wild

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sweet i'll definitely like the wild

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
sweet i'll definitely like the wild
grass<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.539> trimmed<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
grass because it's really trimmed down I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.329 
grass because it's really trimmed down I
can<00:01:04.019> wish<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.350> higher<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.129> but

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
can wish it was higher up actually but

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
can wish it was higher up actually but
now<00:01:06.000> i<00:01:06.030> guess<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.360> fun<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
now i guess it's fun and you can see the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.710 
now i guess it's fun and you can see the
coal<00:01:08.369> looks<00:01:08.640> sweet<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> texture<00:01:09.570> pack

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
coal looks sweet this is a texture pack

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.260 
coal looks sweet this is a texture pack
that<00:01:09.869> looks<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.260> cool<00:01:10.760> it's<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:12.030> similar

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that looks really cool it's very similar

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.140 
that looks really cool it's very similar
to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> Dokus<00:01:13.470> RPG<00:01:13.979> texture<00:01:14.250> pack<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.670> thought

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to the Dokus RPG texture pack I thought

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.100 
to the Dokus RPG texture pack I thought
it<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.299> actually<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.659> same<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.080> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it was actually the same thing but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.420 
it was actually the same thing but
continued<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.310> actually

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
continued but I think it's actually

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
continued but I think it's actually
different<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
different now and so just kind of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.390 
different now and so just kind of
showing<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> guys<00:01:19.680> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> landscape

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
showing you guys kind of the landscape

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
showing you guys kind of the landscape
here<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.659> looks<00:01:21.810> sweet<00:01:22.020> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here I think that looks sweet just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.219 
here I think that looks sweet just
absolutely<00:01:22.979> awesome<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.049> there's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
absolutely awesome and you know there's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
absolutely awesome and you know there's
the<00:01:25.380> flowers<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> moving<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> water

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the flowers kind of moving on the water

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
the flowers kind of moving on the water
looks<00:01:28.380> nice<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> water<00:01:28.890> flows<00:01:29.220> nicely<00:01:29.490> as

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
looks nice the water flows nicely as

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.810 
looks nice the water flows nicely as
well<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.020> flow<00:01:31.820> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
well if I can kind of get flow that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
a really all around solid texture pack

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
a really all around solid texture pack
this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.380> I've<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.590> running<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this is one that I've been running for a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
this is one that I've been running for a
little<00:01:38.670> while<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.140> enjoy<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
little while now and I really enjoy it

little while now and I really enjoy it
this<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> will<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this is one that I will have on for a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
this is one that I will have on for a
while<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.860> definitely<00:01:43.950> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
while I think and it can definitely be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.359 
while I think and it can definitely be
like<00:01:44.430> actual<00:01:45.060> replacement<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.899> minecraft

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
like actual replacement to minecraft

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
like actual replacement to minecraft
textures<00:01:47.659> unlike<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:48.990> other<00:01:49.049> ones
