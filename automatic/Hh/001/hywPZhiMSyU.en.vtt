00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.189
 let's know the importance of having 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.010
 a drinking water meter in the 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:11.460
 housing if for this we will know 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.260
 first what is a meter is a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 equipment used to measure the amount 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.820
 of drinking water that you consume daily in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.199
 your home based on a reading 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 monthly the drinking water meter causes 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.240
 Electric power works with the flow 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 of water the hand turns when there 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.770
 water consumption and stops in case 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 otherwise if you do not have a meter 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.659
 of drinking water you can buy one in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.780
 any hardware store and order EPSase 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.219
 to install it at your home 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.030
 With a meter you can control 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.889
 your water consumption and thus save money 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.839
 the benefits we have in having 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:51.020
 a drinking water meter at home are 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.350
 the following 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.390
 you just pay for water consumption will 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.030
 lets know if inside your 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.830
 housing there is water leak encourages the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.950
 development of the savings culture 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.950
 Water 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.979
 and something very important if you think that you 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.130
 meter is not working 10 you can 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.100
 request to exact a review going on 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.500
 with a test of contrast that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 does in a laboratory or bank of 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.900
 meters is important to know how to read 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 Drinking water meter numbering 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.880
 black color record cubic meters 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 and the red numbers correspond to the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 liters of drinking water consumed 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.240
 to verify the proper functioning of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.409
 your meter closes all the keys 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.259
 water from your house 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.170
 I watched your meter and write down what numbers 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.750
 brand at that time receives the water in 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.609
 a bucket that has a measure of preference 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 then look at the red numbers of the 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.750
 meter and verify the difference that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.689
 corresponds to the liters contained in the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.759
 bucket with water the new meters to 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.709
 difference from the previous ones have 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.020
 thermoplastic caps with viewfinder 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.409
 reading where you can see yourself 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.689
 consumption record besides being 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.140
 reinforced with a concrete die that 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:15.180
 precludes the meter theft 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 billing of not well was not yet of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 18.40 this was the receipt that still 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.099
 belongs when they still did not have the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.290
 meter not but as of the month of 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.240
 January have already billed us in accordance 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.440
 possibly 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.020
 to consumption does not come to 08 60 years well 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.630
 present that the only responsible before 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.150
 the misuse or theft of the meter is you 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.760
 as owner for it takes care that people 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.770
 outside of the handle do not tamper with the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.140
 meter because in many cases they are 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.070
 thieves only the staff 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.110
 authorized hunting can access it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.630
 remember with your drinking water meter 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.630
 your water care will be more responsible
