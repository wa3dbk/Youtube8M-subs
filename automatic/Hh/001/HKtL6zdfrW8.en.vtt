controlled you can keep the movements

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.430

here especially as you roll down here

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.430 
here especially as you roll down here
we'll<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.460> few<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.760> these<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.480> all<00:02:26.320> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
we'll just do a few of these and all the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.490 
we'll just do a few of these and all the
way<00:02:26.530> down<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.090> all<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.600> way<00:02:28.810> back<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.230> breathe

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
way down and all the way back up breathe

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500 
way down and all the way back up breathe
a<00:02:29.530> whole<00:02:29.830> lot<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.100> fuller<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.790> deeper<00:02:30.820> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
a whole lot the fuller and deeper you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.240 
a whole lot the fuller and deeper you
breathe<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.080> easier<00:02:32.110> your<00:02:32.620> body<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:33.040> move

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
breathe the easier your body can move

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.640 
breathe the easier your body can move
for<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.820> calmer<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> mind<00:02:34.600> gets<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.560> if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
for you the calmer the mind gets so if

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.410 
for you the calmer the mind gets so if
you<00:02:35.770> stop<00:02:36.100> breathing<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.240> your

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
you stop breathing it's just like your

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.930 
you stop breathing it's just like your
body<00:02:37.570> has<00:02:37.930> no<00:02:38.170> fuel<00:02:38.800> no<00:02:38.830> energy<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.580> work<00:02:39.760> with

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
body has no fuel no energy to work with

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
body has no fuel no energy to work with
so<00:02:40.120> everything<00:02:40.480> becomes<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.930> lot<00:02:41.110> tough<00:02:41.770> for<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
so everything becomes a lot tough for a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.730 
so everything becomes a lot tough for a
lot<00:02:42.220> more<00:02:42.370> tense<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:43.410> couple<00:02:44.410> more<00:02:44.530> breaths

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
lot more tense a couple more breaths

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.330 
lot more tense a couple more breaths
here<00:02:48.030> all<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.210> way<00:02:49.300> down<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:50.320> like<00:02:51.130> you're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
reaching out really long with the heels

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.070 
reaching out really long with the heels

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.900 
all that a couple inches up off the
ground<00:03:02.650> I'm<00:03:02.890> going<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> curl<00:03:03.670> up<00:03:03.880> your

forehead<00:03:04.330> here<00:03:04.750> holding<00:03:05.410> here<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.860> few

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
forehead here holding here for a few

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.550 
forehead here holding here for a few
breaths<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.790> then<00:03:06.850> we'll<00:03:07.810> switch<00:03:08.020> here<00:03:08.380> so

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
breaths and then we'll switch here so

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.080 
breaths and then we'll switch here so
the<00:03:08.650> hard<00:03:08.860> part<00:03:09.100> isn't<00:03:09.280> really<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.700> switching

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the hard part isn't really the switching

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.370 
the hard part isn't really the switching
and<00:03:10.239> hold<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.570> switching<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.050> it's<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
and hold and switching but it's the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.860 
and hold and switching but it's the
holding<00:03:11.800> here<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.220> staying<00:03:12.910> might<00:03:13.540> start<00:03:13.780> to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
holding here so staying might start to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.570
