00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
now if you look at the motion in full

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:27.900 
now if you look at the motion in full
range

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.880 

that's<00:01:28.910> how<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.120> do<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.270> forehand<00:01:29.870> with<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
round so it's facing the other direction

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.810 
round so it's facing the other direction
so<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.010> hole<00:01:43.160> is<00:01:43.190> facing<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.729> other

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
direction then we go back to our normal

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.810 
direction then we go back to our normal
backhand<00:01:49.660> situation

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
backhand situation

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:02.109

point follow-through so now the full

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:18.550 
point follow-through so now the full
range<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.290> motion<00:02:06.350> should<00:02:06.920> be<00:02:06.979> as<00:02:07.190> follows<00:02:17.560> so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
range of motion should be as follows so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.220
