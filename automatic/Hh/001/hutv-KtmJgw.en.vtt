00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
first hour even though we strained a lot

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.060

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
of the fat off there's going to be a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.170 
of the fat off there's going to be a
layer<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.190> fat<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.600> will<00:04:35.700> rise<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.000> top

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
layer of fat that will rise to the top

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.480 
layer of fat that will rise to the top
and<00:04:37.480> once<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.080> cools<00:04:38.290> down<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:38.680> can<00:04:38.919> take<00:04:39.340> it

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
and once it cools down we can take it

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.210 
and once it cools down we can take it
off<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:40.480> want<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.720> do<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:41.140> before<00:04:41.530> you

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
off you want to do this before you

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.540 
off you want to do this before you
reduce<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.990> stock<00:04:44.320> because<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.280> don't<00:04:45.430> want

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
reduce the stock because you don't want

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.520 
reduce the stock because you don't want
that<00:04:45.610> fat<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.240> be<00:04:46.390> incorporated<00:04:47.140> into<00:04:47.320> the

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
that fat to be incorporated into the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.640 
that fat to be incorporated into the
stock<00:04:48.360> we<00:04:49.360> did<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> pretty<00:04:49.750> good<00:04:49.870> job<00:04:49.930> because

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
stock we did a pretty good job because

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.310 
stock we did a pretty good job because
there's<00:04:50.950> not<00:04:51.130> much<00:04:51.430> fat<00:04:52.120> on<00:04:52.390> top<00:04:52.480> of<00:04:53.050> this

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
there's not much fat on top of this
