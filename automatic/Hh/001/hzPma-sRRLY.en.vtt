00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 and much today is much cuter than other equipment is not a small team 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.190
 see if we compare it with the days 6 1 3 1

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.330
 directly against a bundle of cigarettes marlboro ks sacramento equal 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.200
 in all the

 something is heard 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.850
 all the buttons are handled that full house uses was a go back and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.800
 advance

 button 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.330
 are all the external controls that is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.760
