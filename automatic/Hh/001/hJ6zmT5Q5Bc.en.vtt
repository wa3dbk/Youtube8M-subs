00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
anyway we jump straight into the game

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.549 
anyway we jump straight into the game
and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:38.390> tried<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> clear<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:39.960> goalkeeper

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and I tried to clear of my goalkeeper

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
and I tried to clear of my goalkeeper
and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> first<00:00:41.190> goal<00:00:41.399> failed<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> him<00:00:41.969> which

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and the first goal failed to him which

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
and the first goal failed to him which
was<00:00:42.480> quite<00:00:42.690> sloppy<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
was quite sloppy by me but as as a as I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
was quite sloppy by me but as as a as I
was<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.809> nail<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.350> 21<00:00:46.710> minutes<00:00:46.890> i

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
was only one nail down at 21 minutes i

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
was only one nail down at 21 minutes i
thought<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.250> may<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> chance<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> get<00:00:48.000> back

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
thought i may have a chance to get back

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750 
thought i may have a chance to get back
into<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> game<00:00:48.770> this<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.550> as

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
into the game this time I'm not to be as

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.880 
into the game this time I'm not to be as
Ambrose<00:00:51.420> put<00:00:51.899> me<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:53.610> kneel<00:00:53.850> down<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Ambrose put me to kneel down and it just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
Ambrose put me to kneel down and it just
got<00:00:56.010> worse<00:00:56.219> from<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:57.289> Ambrose<00:00:58.289> who

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
got worse from there as Ambrose who

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
got worse from there as Ambrose who
seemed<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.129> star<00:00:59.399> man<00:00:59.809> had<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> shot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
seemed to be his star man had a shot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.420 
seemed to be his star man had a shot
blocked<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> felt<00:01:01.920> straight<00:01:02.250> into<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
blocked but it felt straight into the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.660 
blocked but it felt straight into the
path<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.879> scannell<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.719> scannell<00:01:04.559> however<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
path of scannell or scannell however you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.350 
path of scannell or scannell however you
want<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> say<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.640> nil<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
want to say it and to make it to nil I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.679 
want to say it and to make it to nil I
believe<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.320> no<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.729> yep<00:01:11.729> three<00:01:12.299> no<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
believe or three no on yep three no and

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.320 
believe or three no on yep three no and
that<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> game<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.490> didn't<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.210> have

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that was the game I didn't really have

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.990 
that was the game I didn't really have
that<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.650> worth<00:01:16.860> showing<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that much or not much worth showing so I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
that much or not much worth showing so I
thought<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.540> probably<00:01:19.170> need<00:01:19.439> some<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.890> gold

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
thought I'm probably need some more gold

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.390
