00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
students can get into the fall line with

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.330 
students can get into the fall line with
their<00:00:06.900> board<00:00:07.170> straight<00:00:07.500> from<00:00:07.799> either<00:00:08.040> edge

their board straight from either edge
it's<00:00:09.030> time<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.600> start<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.590> change<00:00:10.920> edges<00:00:11.520> right

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
it's time to start to change edges right

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.400 
it's time to start to change edges right
so<00:00:12.570> how<00:00:12.660> we're<00:00:12.780> going<00:00:12.869> to<00:00:12.930> do<00:00:13.020> this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.289> we're

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.770 
the next and final step to our beginner
progression<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:55.789> link<00:01:56.000> these<00:01:56.270> simple

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
progression is to link these simple

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.710 
progression is to link these simple
isolated<00:01:57.470> turns<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.979> we've<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.159> done<00:01:58.720> do

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
isolated turns that we've just done do

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.389 
isolated turns that we've just done do
this<00:01:59.899> it's<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.409> matter<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.829> keeping<00:02:01.130> your

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
this it's a matter of keeping your

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.880 
this it's a matter of keeping your
momentum<00:02:01.939> through<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.960> side<00:02:03.229> slit<00:02:03.619> and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
momentum through the side slit and

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 
momentum through the side slit and
through<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.970> Traverse<00:02:05.329> of<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.630> hill<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.020> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
through the Traverse of the hill so that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.450 
through the Traverse of the hill so that
you<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:06.350> make<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.530> next<00:02:06.799> turn<00:02:07.069> simply

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
you can make that next turn simply

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.460 
you can make that next turn simply
without<00:02:07.640> stopping<00:02:08.300> but<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.140> may<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:09.259> to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
without stopping but you may want to

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.320 
without stopping but you may want to
remind<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.860> students<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.340> count<00:02:10.970> through

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
remind the students is to count through

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.600 
remind the students is to count through
their<00:02:11.480> turn<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.140> keep<00:02:12.530> us<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.769> same<00:02:13.040> shape<00:02:13.400> and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
their turn to keep us the same shape and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.100 
their turn to keep us the same shape and
the<00:02:13.700> same<00:02:13.910> size<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.569> they<00:02:14.690> don't<00:02:14.750> want<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
the same size and they don't want to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.620 
the same size and they don't want to
pick<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.620> any<00:02:15.920> more<00:02:16.190> speed<00:02:16.549> than<00:02:16.730> necessary<00:02:17.269> it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
pick up any more speed than necessary it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.740 
pick up any more speed than necessary it
keeps

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.820

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
sighs turn and we'll see after fine
