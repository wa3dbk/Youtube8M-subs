is when i'm going to refresh my pc

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.469 
is when i'm going to refresh my pc
instead<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.869> will<00:01:11.110> reinstall<00:01:11.649> windows<00:01:12.479> but

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
instead this will reinstall windows but

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.249 
instead this will reinstall windows but
keep<00:01:13.750> my<00:01:13.960> personal<00:01:14.380> files<00:01:14.860> user<00:01:15.520> accounts

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.899 

the<00:01:27.590> whole<00:01:27.740> process<00:01:27.950> takes<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.760> few

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
the whole process takes just a few

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.550 
the whole process takes just a few
minutes<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.360> can<00:01:29.600> be<00:01:29.690> pretty<00:01:29.900> handy<00:01:30.320> when

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
minutes and can be pretty handy when

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
minutes and can be pretty handy when
helping<00:01:30.860> others<00:01:31.100> with<00:01:31.130> their<00:01:31.340> PCs<00:01:31.850> especially

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
helping others with their PCs especially

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.180 
helping others with their PCs especially
since<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.049> doesn't<00:01:33.200> require<00:01:33.530> backing<00:01:33.979> up<00:01:34.070> all

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
since it doesn't require backing up all

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.060 
since it doesn't require backing up all
the<00:01:34.250> data<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:35.240> another<00:01:35.420> drive<00:01:35.780> first<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.440> then

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
the data to another drive first and then

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.910 
the data to another drive first and then
putting<00:01:37.280> them<00:01:37.400> back<00:01:37.520> later<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.740> see

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
putting them back later as we can see

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
putting them back later as we can see
here<00:01:39.950> all<00:01:40.250> my<00:01:40.850> metro-style<00:01:41.180> apps<00:01:41.479> are

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
here all my metro-style apps are

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.770 
here all my metro-style apps are
preserved

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.289 

and<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.470> can<00:01:51.590> also<00:01:51.710> see<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.070> my<00:01:52.790> data<00:01:53.030> are

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.899 
and you can also see that my data are
here<00:01:53.659> as<00:01:53.750> well
