00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.360 
originally but the cracked hinge was
very<00:05:45.900> annoying<00:05:46.230> when<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:46.530> was<00:05:46.710> playing<00:05:46.920> Silent

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
very annoying when I was playing Silent

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.890 
very annoying when I was playing Silent
Hill<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.730> swapped<00:05:48.090> covers

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
Hill so I swapped covers

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.210 
Hill so I swapped covers
and<00:05:50.490> lastly<00:05:51.600> point-blank<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:52.870> which<00:05:53.140> I<00:05:53.470> ruined

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
and lastly point-blank to which I ruined

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.850 
and lastly point-blank to which I ruined
myself<00:05:54.670> by<00:05:54.880> using<00:05:55.120> acetone<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.230> remove<00:05:56.320> some

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
myself by using acetone to remove some

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.310 
myself by using acetone to remove some
stickers<00:05:57.250> so<00:05:57.750> it's<00:05:58.750> pretty<00:05:58.930> obvious<00:05:59.290> that

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
stickers so it's pretty obvious that

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.190 
stickers so it's pretty obvious that
this<00:05:59.530> one<00:05:59.740> needs<00:05:59.920> replacement<00:06:00.250> so<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.990> those

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
this one needs replacement so it's those

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.420 
this one needs replacement so it's those
three<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:02.850> can<00:06:03.850> replace<00:06:04.120> immediately<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:05.430> then

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
three I can replace immediately and then

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.790 
three I can replace immediately and then
I've<00:06:06.550> got<00:06:06.760> three<00:06:06.790> more<00:06:07.150> spares<00:06:07.540> in<00:06:08.170> case<00:06:08.410> I<00:06:08.560> get

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
I've got three more spares in case I get

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.120 
I've got three more spares in case I get
more<00:06:09.070> ps1<00:06:09.520> games<00:06:09.790> or<00:06:10.000> more<00:06:10.270> boxes<00:06:10.780> great<00:06:11.340> so

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
more ps1 games or more boxes great so

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.500 
more ps1 games or more boxes great so
that's<00:06:15.130> everything<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:15.880> was<00:06:16.150> inside<00:06:16.450> the

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
that's everything that was inside the

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.870 
that's everything that was inside the
box<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:18.900> then<00:06:19.900> I<00:06:20.230> saw<00:06:21.100> we<00:06:21.310> have<00:06:21.490> a<00:06:21.520> couple<00:06:21.790> of

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
box and then I saw we have a couple of

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.660 
box and then I saw we have a couple of
free<00:06:22.210> gifts<00:06:22.540> now<00:06:22.930> I<00:06:23.260> knew<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:23.860> was<00:06:24.190> going<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.460> get

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
free gifts now I knew I was going to get

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.300 
free gifts now I knew I was going to get
some<00:06:24.880> free<00:06:25.120> gifts<00:06:25.480> with<00:06:25.660> the<00:06:26.620> boxes<00:06:27.280> right

some free gifts with the boxes right

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.490 
some free gifts with the boxes right
over<00:06:27.730> there<00:06:27.880> but<00:06:28.180> I<00:06:28.300> had<00:06:28.570> no<00:06:28.840> idea<00:06:28.990> what<00:06:29.290> it<00:06:29.350> was

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
over there but I had no idea what it was

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.160 
over there but I had no idea what it was
going<00:06:29.650> to<00:06:29.800> be<00:06:29.950> so<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:31.330> see<00:06:31.570> you<00:06:31.660> can<00:06:31.930> see<00:06:32.050> it's

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
going to be so you see you can see it's

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.070 
going to be so you see you can see it's
something<00:06:32.380> dream<00:06:32.830> casting<00:06:33.370> oh<00:06:36.540> well<00:06:37.540> that's<00:06:37.750> a

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
something dream casting oh well that's a

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.520 
something dream casting oh well that's a
game<00:06:38.680> obviously<00:06:39.420> not<00:06:40.420> a<00:06:40.450> game<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:40.750> know<00:06:40.960> but

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
game obviously not a game I know but

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.790 
game obviously not a game I know but
certainly<00:06:42.400> going<00:06:42.610> to<00:06:42.670> try<00:06:42.910> it<00:06:43.030> and<00:06:43.840> another

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
certainly going to try it and another

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.760 
certainly going to try it and another
black<00:06:45.160> vmu<00:06:45.730> well<00:06:46.000> I<00:06:46.270> certainly<00:06:47.050> didn't<00:06:47.380> expect

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
black vmu well I certainly didn't expect

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.240 
black vmu well I certainly didn't expect
that<00:06:47.980> so<00:06:48.370> I<00:06:48.960> guess<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.140> means<00:06:50.260> I<00:06:50.470> have<00:06:50.590> plenty

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
that so I guess that means I have plenty

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.670 
that so I guess that means I have plenty
of<00:06:51.400> storage<00:06:52.210> room<00:06:52.630> for<00:06:52.810> my<00:06:52.900> drink<00:06:53.200> as<00:06:53.410> right

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
of storage room for my drink as right

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.640 
of storage room for my drink as right
now<00:06:54.420> more<00:06:55.420> than<00:06:55.570> I'll<00:06:55.660> ever<00:06:55.690> need<00:06:56.140> probably

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
now more than I'll ever need probably

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.140 
now more than I'll ever need probably
but<00:06:57.840> well<00:06:58.840> I<00:06:59.400> probably<00:07:00.400> should<00:07:00.670> try<00:07:00.790> to<00:07:00.910> get

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
but well I probably should try to get

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.110 
but well I probably should try to get
Shenmue<00:07:01.570> II<00:07:01.600> now<00:07:02.190> probably<00:07:03.190> I<00:07:03.310> believe<00:07:03.580> it<00:07:04.000> has

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
Shenmue II now probably I believe it has

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.350 
Shenmue II now probably I believe it has
very<00:07:04.420> large<00:07:04.600> savegame<00:07:05.140> so<00:07:05.470> I<00:07:05.950> can<00:07:06.940> definitely

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
very large savegame so I can definitely

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.110 
very large savegame so I can definitely
use<00:07:07.510> an<00:07:07.660> extra<00:07:07.930> extra<00:07:08.290> one<00:07:08.470> so<00:07:09.120> that's

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
use an extra extra one so that's

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.060 
use an extra extra one so that's
