00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
getting sabersense chips and now we need

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.420 
getting sabersense chips and now we need
to<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.969> is<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:28.049> up<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.379> top<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.799> these<00:02:28.890> cabinets

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to do is go up on top of these cabinets

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
to do is go up on top of these cabinets
these<00:02:29.670> computer<00:02:30.060> cabinets<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:31.260> there

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
these computer cabinets because there

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:44.000 
these computer cabinets because there
are<00:02:31.739> boxes<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.489> top<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.939> them<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.209> well

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.710 

I<00:02:44.159> think<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:44.939> said<00:02:45.120> before<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
I think like I said before this is a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.350 
I think like I said before this is a
pretty<00:02:45.900> wild<00:02:46.590> game<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.280> graphics<00:02:47.700> are<00:02:48.180> really

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
pretty wild game the graphics are really

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.000 
pretty wild game the graphics are really
great<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.360> play<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.720> 3d<00:02:52.110> so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
great and you can play it in 3d so

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.819 
great and you can play it in 3d so
that's<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.489> amazing<00:02:54.590> obviously<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> didn't

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
that's just amazing obviously I didn't

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.190 
that's just amazing obviously I didn't
record<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.430> 3d<00:02:56.819> because<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.689> recording

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
record it in 3d because the recording

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.819 
record it in 3d because the recording
wouldn't<00:02:58.829> look<00:02:58.890> very<00:02:58.950> good<00:02:59.220> but<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:01.049> am<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.709> am

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
wouldn't look very good but I am I am

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.559 
wouldn't look very good but I am I am
playing<00:03:02.129> planning<00:03:02.940> on<00:03:03.060> playing<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:04.159> for<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.220> bit

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
playing planning on playing it for a bit

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:14.509 
playing planning on playing it for a bit
in<00:03:06.569> 3d<00:03:07.530> once<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.159> goes<00:03:08.599> these<00:03:09.599> videos<00:03:13.220> okay<00:03:14.220> so

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
in 3d once it goes these videos okay so

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.800 
in 3d once it goes these videos okay so
i<00:03:14.579> think<00:03:14.670> we've<00:03:14.879> cleared<00:03:15.239> out<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.420> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
i think we've cleared out all the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
i think we've cleared out all the
collectibles<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.040> boxes<00:03:17.489> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
collectibles all the boxes and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
collectibles all the boxes and
containers<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:20.359> looks<00:03:21.359> like<00:03:21.510> there's<00:03:21.720> a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
us to one of the computers that we have

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.339 
us to one of the computers that we have
to<00:03:29.010> hack<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.700> put<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.940> Wi-Fi<00:03:30.389> transmitter<00:03:30.900> on

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
to hack or put a Wi-Fi transmitter on

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.460 
to hack or put a Wi-Fi transmitter on
sketchup<00:03:34.349> down<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.650> hall<00:03:36.260> okay<00:03:37.260> this

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
sketchup down this hall okay this

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.309 
sketchup down this hall okay this
doesn't<00:03:37.620> look<00:03:37.889> good<00:03:37.950> looks<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:38.819> there's<00:03:39.030> a

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
doesn't look good looks like there's a

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.759 
doesn't look good looks like there's a
dish<00:03:40.319> coming<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.799> us<00:03:41.060> force<00:03:42.060> field<00:03:42.389> to<00:03:43.170> sneak

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
just hold down the square button can you

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.320 
just hold down the square button can you
give<00:04:49.479> you<00:04:49.569> a<00:04:49.630> signature<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.770> then<00:04:50.919> you<00:04:51.039> gotta

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
pull this lever leaver actually opens

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.490 
pull this lever leaver actually opens
the<00:04:57.639> door<00:04:57.849> that's<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.210> front<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.479> us<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:59.349> on<00:04:59.470> a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the door that's in front of us it's on a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.339 
the door that's in front of us it's on a
timer<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.009> it'll<00:05:00.280> automatically<00:05:00.819> close<00:05:01.349> so

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
timer so it'll automatically close so

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.050 
timer so it'll automatically close so
you<00:05:02.440> have<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.680> pull<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.190> lever<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.639> then<00:05:03.789> get

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
you have to pull the lever and then get

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.580 
you have to pull the lever and then get
out<00:05:04.090> quick<00:05:04.479> and<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:08.020> looks<00:05:08.169> like<00:05:08.229> we<00:05:08.470> have<00:05:08.500> some

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
out quick and it looks like we have some

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.770 
out quick and it looks like we have some
more<00:05:08.889> enemies<00:05:09.190> come<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:09.759> it's<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.690> a

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
more enemies come in here it's like a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.930 
more enemies come in here it's like a
couple<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.169> toasters<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:13.949> believe<00:05:14.949> there<00:05:15.310> are<00:05:15.849> a

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
couple of toasters I believe there are a

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.149 
couple of toasters I believe there are a
couple<00:05:16.090> of<00:05:16.270> food<00:05:16.479> processors<00:05:17.080> well<00:05:17.409> I<00:05:17.710> dropped

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
couple of food processors well I dropped

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:26.629 
couple of food processors well I dropped
it<00:05:23.759> just<00:05:24.759> keep<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:25.030> toasters<00:05:25.539> at<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.110> distance

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
it just keep the toasters at a distance

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.420 
it just keep the toasters at a distance
keep<00:05:27.639> firing<00:05:27.880> at<00:05:28.180> them

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.050 

and<00:05:33.300> we'll<00:05:34.230> fire<00:05:34.440> at<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:37.280> two<00:05:38.280> processors<00:05:38.880> as

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
and we'll fire at the two processors as

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.320 
and we'll fire at the two processors as
well<00:05:40.190> because<00:05:41.190> we<00:05:41.430> don't<00:05:41.580> really<00:05:41.910> like<00:05:42.090> having

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
well because we don't really like having

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.870 
well because we don't really like having
that<00:05:42.630> green<00:05:42.900> stuff<00:05:42.930> thrown<00:05:43.650> at<00:05:43.740> us<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:47.730> we're

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
that green stuff thrown at us and we're

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.400 
that green stuff thrown at us and we're
going<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.030> go<00:05:48.150> up<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.480> we'll<00:05:48.960> collect<00:05:49.170> the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
going to go up and we'll collect the

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.800 
going to go up and we'll collect the
sabersense<00:05:49.950> chips<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:51.060> food
