00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 raspberry juice made with raspberries and 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 light fruit or sultan classes done in the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 same way I showed 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.910
 regarding the recipe of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.399
 panna cotta we begin the preparation 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 I put our egg whites in the planetary 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:07.820
 with a pinch of salt and start a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.820
 mount before inserting classic fruit 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.170
 now that our egg white has 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.869
 made some bubbles we can 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.079
 insert a portion of our fruit into 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.079
 classic about a third and we continue 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
 meanwhile that our albums it 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.479
 answer mount we start slamming 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:39.049
 the egg yolks add a bit of gest 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.619
 of lemon inside the egg only the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.640
 yellow part and without exaggerating to a minimum 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:51.530
 at 1 and began to pour very much 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.920
 slowly with the marisa in pastry 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.689
 it is very important to respect the dosages 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 we can switch off 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.399
 we must be careful to move it 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.929
 from top to bottom without taking it apart 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.310
 we give it a spin because of 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.080
 album and that was inside the whip 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 obviously it has remained whiter 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.830
 incorporated less place 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.580
 now slowly sieve if in this one 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.340
 phase you have someone who helps you and b 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.380
 berta the flour slowly while 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.260
 you turn better 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.140
 here's our dough is ready; 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.609
 then put a bit in the bag a little bit 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.799
 wide 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.810
 I have already obviously cut before 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.970
 put the dough in the close 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.390
 otherwise it is quite liquid e 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.390
 escapes 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 we turn the oven to 170 degrees dirty 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.290
 little by little the pan at the four corners 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.200
 so that the parchment paper will remain the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.360
 also attached in cooking 3 does not render 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.360
 from pastry I fill 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.290
 and then we begin to prepare these 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:19.510
 biscuits that we will need for the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.600
 our cake our charlotte to a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:29.460
 fluid movement constant pressure in 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.170
 oven at 170 degrees for about 15 minutes 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.990
 obviously it depends on the types of oven in the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.350
 my case maybe it will take a few minutes 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.520
 plus the last five minutes in the oven 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.650
 open if you don't have the tool in place 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.620
 to keep the oven open you can 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.780
 simply put a rag on it 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.310
 canvas our savoy are you 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.690
 ready 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.940
 here we have to prepare the part that 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.150
 goes within our structure 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.210
 so let's take our 500 grams of 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:09.330
 cream and 250 g of 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:14.310
 good quality mascarpone fruit 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.340
 light also our pod of 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.340
 vanilla 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.230
 we start at low speed because inside 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.300
 there is a thick ingredient like mascarpone 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.230
 and the liquid like the ball squirts 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.230
 all out 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.500
 ok now we can integrate at this point 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.150
 of a game only a goccino of 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.380
 raspberry syrup made in a bain-marie 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.380
 power to a minimum 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.730
 we are called it is 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.830
 ok the cream said the chantilly al 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.030
 mascarpone because it has become one 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:05.800
 mascarpone chantilly with vanilla e 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.910
 raspberry syrup voila the Savoyard 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.280
 always attacks 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.040
 there is no way not to let it not attack 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:20.970
 do not flour do not just stick with 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:20.970
 the small spoon takes up my ring 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.189
 a little raspberry juice market raspberry 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.330
 on the bottom 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.330
 but let's fill up 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.730
 let's put a few more drops of it 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.130
 syrup our raspberries before 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.770
 remove ring we let it cool in 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.180
 refrigerator for a few hours ok ours 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.160
 choice was a few hours in 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.910
 refrigerator now we can remove 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.490
 more easily mocks we decorate with 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.450
 a mint leaf and is ready for 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.450
