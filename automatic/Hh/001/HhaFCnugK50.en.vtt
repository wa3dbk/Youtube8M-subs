 an absurd five-year-old 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.680
 be very careful when buying the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.330
 school stuff do not fall on the wave you do not have

 a lot of product goes in this wave of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.120
 brand because mark costs more expensive 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 analyzes and if it's really worth it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.930
 lending without charging many companies is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.030
 who uses a cartoon and there 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.040
 there is a value to be paid by the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.410
 the company then the cost of a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.840
 example a backpack with the child is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.329
 much more expensive depending on the character 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.180
 December, for example, that is being 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.280
 placed there javey stay tuned do not fall 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 in this wave to try to save because 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.600
 the hook is not easy not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.439
 we prepared a report on this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 open topic the research season 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.640
 of school supplies 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 every year parents do item research 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.830
 that the children will use at school 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 the bookstore and stationery syndicate 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.000
 warns that the list of school materials 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.220
 will be eight percent more expensive in 2015 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 for those parents who like to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 scheduling the moment is this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 because the stationery shops are still 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.759
 emptying the price search 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 walter owners of stationery stores is already 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.960
 accustomed to movement and alert to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.439
 parents that this is the time for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.299
 because stationery is 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.540
 stocked and you can find lots 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.329
 good options are they come with two 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.759
 focus on the quality of the type of 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.579
 product right character 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.340
 according to the price sometimes also some 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 want is term also prefers a term 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.979
 longer, but in general it is a search for 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.540
 good prices and also material that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.010
 even in the quality they are 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 wishing another important tip is 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.110
 several children at the time of the survey 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.360
 suffering for parents and children will be almost 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 unavoidable because children want to 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 only what you please does not 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.970
 think of the price making it difficult to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.490
 from parents 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.680
 gilza has learned the lesson does not 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.930
 10 year old son for shopping 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.900
 this year the boy chose the theme man 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.820
 spider for all materials but Joseph 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.610
 says that the planned budget is what 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.730
 account is the bag because everyone who 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.820
 change because that age of 10 years they 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.790
 They can not stand nerd destroy and no way 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.280
 then the new notebooks do things 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.200
 already the strip took the granddaughter to the purchases 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.370
 but warns that not always does the will 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.170
 of the girl 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.880
 the important thing is not to exceed your 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.120
 shopping expectations 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.340
 I am so we choose to fall to work 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.709
 go for me is to see when 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.550
 among the cast he will be best at 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.200
 the price is that when she does some 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.220
 thing is out of this measure the lady 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.880
 how do you do 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.010
 then I want to want to give you idea is 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.620
 to know even better do not buy anything 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.380
 who is going to buy everything at once who 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.930
 not for parents who like to take 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.390
 the kids we an option is let the 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.150
 in the reading areas normally 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.550
 stationers make available the teacher 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.040
 samuel sayings for the kids 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.200
 At that moment, what we say would be 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.060
 the child of that space a little more 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.670
 of the reading moment nÃ© 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.440
 when arriving here for example in the store we 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.540
 we have all this literary space to 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.030
 child can pick up a book can sit 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.340
 that can make new discoveries through 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 of a book, we have history 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.800
