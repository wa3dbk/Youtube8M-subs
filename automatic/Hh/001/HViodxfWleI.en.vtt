00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 Let's go Yes and say here? You go about doing triangular one set of values What problem 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:15.780
 After re-seat dregs child's and such Fu in at the time of 0 positive Nari time c out e 585 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 So what happens if it is given when the value is given 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.699
 It is a problem like 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.520
 This is a very common problem in center exams and tests 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.710
 C meeting it because 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.040
 I'm going to get used to my way, I have no new knowledge to learn 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.989
 That up until now has been the official warehouse relationship of the country 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:40.270
 Especially this 3 c Tadako Theta is given a hint like when it is a bookstore 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.720
 If you're asking for a response like this, just use this formula 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.030
 To know 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.730
 And 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:53.649
 It it is is amazing, Kano factor antelope symmetry expression that use the official of the factorization 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.500
 In is another effortlessly it if familiar if you know that that is to use this formula common 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:01.030
 Because it was a problem that I can do, I'm trying to get used to it 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.619
 I will look at it more specifically 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.159
 There were 3 c Tadako 3 c hit a high 3-seater was Come sign c time of 1 of 3 minutes 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.640
 Nambayo It's Hirame- kun, who has already got used to it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.030
 Speaking of what to do, we square both sides of this 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'm also going to go up here because this is also squared 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:26.119
 If it can be said whether it can do this or not, 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.070
 What will happen to the a + b Article 2 formula is needless to say, but it also improves on a 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.159
 I think was more to fe + b to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.780
 This was the third place c kite's west 2 of Article 4 of Tadashi With + Konishi and Article 2 become had 4 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.700
 I'm coming out here that Tteyuu was Cry 3 of 4 of octopus 3 c obtained 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.409
 cheap 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:50.090
 Theta more than the child's'll girls in this case official of mutual relation of trigonometry 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:54.860
 This stand this I'm made this = 1 reaches comes to 1 it means that this was 1+ 23 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.450
 It can be old-fashioned and it may be 1/9 on equal to 1/3 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 So I moved this to here and I understand that 23 Inko's end of -9 minutes 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.000
 In Inko-san's coinie 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:10.810
 If there is 9-9 minutes if there is, it is a series of flow of this time, are you used to this? 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.140
 It is not difficult anything Tsu Jindo that are familiar only if 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:21.910
 And then it's the second problem. Find out the value of the visiting sheet + visiting sheet + density to feed . 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:27.010
 Speaking of this, this is nothing more than a sine cosine 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.760
 Of course I can't put it out, but it's difficult, but I'm polishing in the third place in a row from here after birth 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.800
 It is said that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.490
 So at this time factoring is square too 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:39.680
 I use this grid feeling often found on paper machines 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.980
 a 3 Article b stance b 3 riding can also be factored like this 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.280
 Ne 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.680
 And 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.340
 Of course, you can use this factorization formula, but say this contrast color that often appears in mathematics 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.670
 But 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.940
 This book amazing when + bookstore is like a also seek Come on now of devastation + This devastation at the time of this 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.340
 There is a useful formula transformation that can be used and that's it 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:07.940
 It is by all means want you to master the Koch 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.230
 a 3-mat + b of the three-party past a + Sanjo district shrimp or the voice of the day + day also stops at When this shop 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.090
 You will find out soon 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:19.849
 It's a beautiful woman is calling on 3 when was Jovi in third place was 3 Notei calling on of a + b 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.360
 This extra also let ne Well, neatly written in the middle or a 3-mat +3 a 2 Article b + 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.490
 3 ab 20 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.090
 I want to ask now if you come to a large number of d a 3 tatami + b 3 this only at 3 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.550
 is not it 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.300
 In other words, this is what I mean by trying to subtract this extra part and this extra part 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:41.220
 If sweet 3 a 2 Article b squared 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.060
 If you do this firmly a 3 tatami and 3 support only Paul Chan 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.950
 And this came with -3 finger this is this formula 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:56.319
 If you know that this a 3 tatami + b misery can be transformed like this 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:00.730
 Use also now have this problem Sanin Sanjo was 30 c to greatness official to say that I'm amazing comfortable 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.670
 Speaking from the top + sign cos- from the top- 33 third place 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.650
 -Let's get used to the small contest put out in the past of the 33-door festival 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.460
 Well then, we know that the value of Kosai, which puts third place , is also here. 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.810
 Because there is 1/3 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:21.180
 Last three minutes a single to or and is just now Tteyuu individual sine cosine of 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.870
 Say 13/27 Once the rest is calculated that can be assigned another all because they obtained in the cool house 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.960
 I can do it in the wind 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:34.790
 Of course it's easy to remember this formula, of course it's okay to remember this factorization formula 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:42.080
 Here is also a child who has a + b t signed out 3 c 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:45.750
 I already know about this when it comes to 1/3 and the second half is more than a sign 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.370
 c- 3rd place city ​​tide 3 c 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:55.220
 I'll be in was more than pasco-year-old c 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.210
 And the value here is also known at the end of the last here, and it is also 1 at this time that it is 1 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.800
 It was 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.759
 From the formula of this relationship 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.349
 So you can determine the value but this contrast color 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.660
 Because the cat's formula transformation is nothing more than this triangle, it will be used a lot 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.560
 Please also know here by all means 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:17.760
 In addition , let's confirm the factorization of this negative one 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.510
 a 30- b 3 riding the I mean could always on the day of issue development was a neck past a 20 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.070
 Right 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:27.569
 I will not explain this in detail anymore, though there is also a way to remember 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:32.460
 I 'm going to follow you as a master of the switch 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:36.029
 Figure 3 ab Kakkoe Date neck was devastation of ab and the common sense say that what happens 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.179
 I think this will also expand and see yourself confirmed 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:44.969
 This statement has a 3 f 9 b 3 mat properly 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:46.139
 By all means calling on here to this ne two controls were + b 3's a + 3-30- 3 finger car voice 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.590
 Or out 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.740
 30 -Besan is 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.370
 This a - b 30 other's finger or voice every day 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:59.200
 I want to master this firmly with Dale. 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:04.450
 After that has been given a value of cos issuing sign It is a form of out well a cat of taste 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.580
 I want to read put out the last sign by squaring both sides of the child because Calculate this value when 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:12.580
 This is great quality though this is also yourself 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.580
 Let's practice firm to find a Ruidai to allow in goods
