00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
to kind of go in a different direction

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.070 
to kind of go in a different direction
wanting<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.230> be<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:50.159> point<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.420> terms<00:01:51.840> of

reason um and I think for a little bit i

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.490 
reason um and I think for a little bit i
was<00:03:30.729> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.000> stumped<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.720> i<00:03:31.810> never<00:03:31.870> had<00:03:32.079> that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
was kind of stumped and i never had that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.990 
was kind of stumped and i never had that
feeling<00:03:32.560> where<00:03:33.099> I<00:03:33.129> was<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.430> what<00:03:33.729> can<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.940> talk

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
about on YouTube and I think it's

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.000 
about on YouTube and I think it's
because<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:38.019> kind<00:03:38.229> of<00:03:38.379> set<00:03:38.530> my<00:03:38.650> bar<00:03:38.889> a<00:03:38.919> little
