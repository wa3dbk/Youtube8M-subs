our since its released about a year or
so<00:00:06.390> ago<00:00:06.569> it's<00:00:07.319> probably<00:00:07.770> become<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.760> the

think just to follow Glee in my view but

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.849 
think just to follow Glee in my view but
here<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.780> let's<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> look<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
here we are let's have a look at it and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
here we are let's have a look at it and
let's<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.190> how<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.570> feels

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
let's see how it feels

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.779 
let's see how it feels
they<00:00:19.560> pick<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.070> notice<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
they pick it up you notice it's a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.000 
they pick it up you notice it's a
reasonably<00:00:21.240> heavy<00:00:21.420> pen<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.960> outrageously<00:00:22.590> so

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
reasonably heavy pen not outrageously so

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.740 
reasonably heavy pen not outrageously so
but<00:00:23.310> there's<00:00:23.550> certainly<00:00:23.850> some<00:00:24.060> substance<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
but there's certainly some substance to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.050 
but there's certainly some substance to
it<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.220> other<00:00:26.310> thing<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> notice<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
it the other thing you notice is the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710 
it the other thing you notice is the
material<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.460> quite<00:00:29.460> dry<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> touch<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
material is quite dry to the touch and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.470 
material is quite dry to the touch and
feels<00:00:31.439> warm<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> say<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
feels warm I was going to say the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
feels warm I was going to say the
material<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> slightly<00:00:34.680> hydric<00:00:35.160> hygroscopic

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
material is slightly hydric hygroscopic

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
material is slightly hydric hygroscopic
which<00:00:36.180> means<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> will<00:00:37.200> absorb<00:00:37.290> small<00:00:38.010> amounts

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which means it will absorb small amounts

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
which means it will absorb small amounts
but<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.610> quit<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.719> why<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:39.989> always

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but they quit which is why I always

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.160 
but they quit which is why I always
feels<00:00:40.649> dry<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> touch<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.020> good

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
feels dry to the touch and it's a good

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.950 
feels dry to the touch and it's a good
positive<00:00:43.469> feel<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> you'll<00:00:45.450> also<00:00:45.600> notice

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
positive feel in it you'll also notice

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
positive feel in it you'll also notice
that<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.800> appointments<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:48.000> high

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that the appointments are very high

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.920 
that the appointments are very high
standard<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.530> they're<00:00:49.649> made<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.980> bronze

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
standard and that they're made of bronze

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
standard and that they're made of bronze
now<00:00:51.930> bronze<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> everybody's<00:00:53.640> cup<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> tea

now bronze and everybody's cup of tea

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
now bronze and everybody's cup of tea
for<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> simple<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.980> over

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
for the simple reason that it will over

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.810 
for the simple reason that it will over
time<00:00:56.430> develop<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> patina<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.309> won't<00:00:59.550> stay

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
time develop a patina so it won't stay

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
time develop a patina so it won't stay
bright<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.390> shiny<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.260> his<00:01:01.379> life<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bright and shiny for all of his life you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
bright and shiny for all of his life you
can<00:01:02.039> polish<00:01:02.219> Italy<00:01:02.670> blue<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> face<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
can polish Italy blue in the face but it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.230 
can polish Italy blue in the face but it
probably<00:01:03.809> won't<00:01:04.140> retain<00:01:04.640> its<00:01:05.640> shine<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
probably won't retain its shine I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.850 
probably won't retain its shine I
personally<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
personally like the way that this is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.260 
personally like the way that this is
gradually<00:01:08.420> developing<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:10.820> passion<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.119> I

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.520 
a nib this is 23-karat palladium very
very<00:02:09.550> pure<00:02:09.880> it's<00:02:10.660> slightly<00:02:10.869> hot<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> slightly

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
very pure it's slightly hot the slightly

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.940 
very pure it's slightly hot the slightly
denser<00:02:11.860> than<00:02:12.610> gold<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.650> consequently<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.710> bit

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
denser than gold and consequently a bit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.310 
denser than gold and consequently a bit
more<00:02:15.070> durable<00:02:15.610> than<00:02:15.790> gold<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.930> how<00:02:17.050> does<00:02:17.170> it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
more durable than gold and how does it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.800 
more durable than gold and how does it
feel<00:02:17.590> well<00:02:18.130> I've<00:02:18.850> been<00:02:19.030> using<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
feel well I've been using this for the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.420 
feel well I've been using this for the
best<00:02:20.020> possible<00:02:20.200> six<00:02:20.560> months<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.370> think

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
best possible six months now and I think

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.120 
best possible six months now and I think
it<00:02:21.790> smells<00:02:22.060> absolutely<00:02:22.300> fantastic<00:02:23.290> we'll

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it smells absolutely fantastic we'll

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.890 
it smells absolutely fantastic we'll
have<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> closer<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:24.970> at<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.750> minute

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
have a closer look at that in a minute

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.680 
have a closer look at that in a minute
so<00:02:26.260> we've<00:02:27.220> got<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> couple<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.790> unusual<00:02:28.150> metals

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
so we've got a couple of unusual metals

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
so we've got a couple of unusual metals
being<00:02:28.930> used<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.530> pen<00:02:29.770> already<00:02:30.040> in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
being used in this pen already in

katakana appts the Palladium for the nib
hidden<00:02:35.230> away<00:02:35.320> inside<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> ink<00:02:36.250> chamber

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
hidden away inside is the ink chamber

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.640 
hidden away inside is the ink chamber
and<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.120> I've<00:02:37.660> got<00:02:37.840> tell<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.350> made<00:02:38.500> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
and that I've got tell you is made of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.250 
and that I've got tell you is made of
platinum<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:40.000> platinum<00:02:40.270> as<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.870> know<00:02:41.080> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
platinum and platinum as you know is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.980 
platinum and platinum as you know is
hugely<00:02:41.560> resistant<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.280> any<00:02:42.520> sort<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.000> attack

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
hugely resistant to any sort of attack

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.010 
hugely resistant to any sort of attack
by<00:02:44.350> acid<00:02:44.920> alkali<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.520> anything<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.840> will

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
by acid alkali like anything so it will

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.840 
by acid alkali like anything so it will
survive<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.860> ink<00:02:48.160> extraordinarily<00:02:48.730> well

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
survive the ink extraordinarily well

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.870 
survive the ink extraordinarily well
well<00:02:52.500> another<00:02:53.500> thing<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.920> might<00:02:54.070> notice<00:02:54.310> is

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
well another thing you might notice is

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.259 
well another thing you might notice is
the<00:02:55.390> way<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.989> cap<00:02:56.200> box<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:57.190> pop<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.090> cap

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
the way that the cap box so pop the cap

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.290 
the way that the cap box so pop the cap
on<00:02:58.510> there<00:03:00.090> that's<00:03:01.090> completely<00:03:01.480> not<00:03:03.120> come<00:03:04.120> off

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
on there that's completely not come off

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.050 
on there that's completely not come off
until<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.290> slightly<00:03:05.620> push<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.280> lovely

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
until you slightly push it in lovely

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.449 
until you slightly push it in lovely
colors<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.830> Visconti's<00:03:10.380> either

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
colors and this is Visconti's either

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.729 
colors and this is Visconti's either
clock<00:03:12.459> or<00:03:12.730> safe<00:03:13.090> lock<00:03:13.390> system<00:03:13.989> all<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.470> got<00:03:14.650> to

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
clock or safe lock system all I got to

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.810 
clock or safe lock system all I got to
say<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.040> extraordinarily<00:03:15.459> effective<00:03:17.820> what

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
say it's extraordinarily effective what

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.770 
say it's extraordinarily effective what
about<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.090> filling<00:03:19.330> system

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
about the filling system

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.160 
about the filling system
well<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:21.220> uses<00:03:21.670> Visconti's<00:03:22.480> powerful

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
well this uses Visconti's powerful

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.620 
well this uses Visconti's powerful
system<00:03:23.680> which<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.370> essentially<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.910> piston

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
system which is essentially a piston

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.199 
system which is essentially a piston
filling<00:03:25.900> system<00:03:26.459> so<00:03:27.459> which<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.820> quick

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
filling system so which is a quick

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.810 
filling system so which is a quick
run-through<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.959> show<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.860> how<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.100> works

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
run-through and show you how it works

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.679 
run-through and show you how it works
so<00:03:31.660> getting<00:03:32.410> bottle<00:03:32.709> ink

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.010 

No

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
No

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.110 
No
now<00:03:39.560> one<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> criticisms<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:40.880> homo

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
now one of the criticisms of the homo

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.970 
now one of the criticisms of the homo
sapiens<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.050> impossible<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.740> tell

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
sapiens is that it's impossible to tell

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.000 
sapiens is that it's impossible to tell
whether<00:03:43.610> there's<00:03:43.940> ink<00:03:44.240> in<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.510> or<00:03:44.810> not<00:03:45.140> either

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
whether there's ink in it or not either

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.250 
whether there's ink in it or not either
although<00:03:46.280> most<00:03:47.210> of<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.390> glass<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:48.050> it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
although most of the glass is like it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.590 
although most of the glass is like it
with<00:03:48.440> Mont<00:03:48.800> Blanc<00:03:49.040> or<00:03:49.370> most<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:50.120> things<00:03:50.420> you

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
with Mont Blanc or most other things you

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.140 
with Mont Blanc or most other things you
can<00:03:50.750> see<00:03:50.930> what's<00:03:51.170> going<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.650> solid<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:53.000> my

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
can see what's going on in solid so my

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.430 
can see what's going on in solid so my
recommendation<00:03:53.840> would<00:03:53.930> be<00:03:53.990> to<00:03:54.110> fill<00:03:54.350> it

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
recommendation would be to fill it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.530 
recommendation would be to fill it
fairly<00:03:54.710> regularly<00:03:54.830> you'll<00:03:55.700> get<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> sense<00:03:56.180> for

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
fairly regularly you'll get a sense for

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.950 
fairly regularly you'll get a sense for
how<00:03:56.900> much<00:03:57.050> ink<00:03:57.290> you're<00:03:57.530> using<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:58.870> get<00:03:59.870> an

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
how much ink you're using and get an

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.390 
how much ink you're using and get an
idea<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.350> how<00:04:00.470> often<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.800> have<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.070> refinish

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
idea of how often you have to refinish

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.090 
idea of how often you have to refinish
however<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.850> film<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.270> once<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:02.840> week<00:04:03.100> just

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
however you film one once a week just

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770 
however you film one once a week just
definitely<00:04:04.430> run<00:04:04.580> out<00:04:04.730> yet<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.360> then<00:04:05.510> maybe<00:04:05.690> I

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
definitely run out yet but then maybe I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.170 
definitely run out yet but then maybe I
don't<00:04:06.580> write<00:04:07.580> enough

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
don't write enough

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.390 
don't write enough
so<00:04:08.810> anyway<00:04:09.080> unscrewing<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.710> top<00:04:09.890> here<00:04:10.220> and

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
so anyway unscrewing the top here and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.020 
so anyway unscrewing the top here and
that<00:04:10.730> frees<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.330> piston<00:04:11.780> which<00:04:12.140> you<00:04:12.380> then

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
that frees up the piston which you then

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.140 
that frees up the piston which you then
place<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.510> pen<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.020> ink<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.940> piston<00:04:17.440> and

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
place the pen in the ink the piston and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.300 
place the pen in the ink the piston and
then<00:04:20.150> push<00:04:21.020> it<00:04:21.049> down<00:04:22.450> again<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
then push it down again and the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.310 
then push it down again and the
recommendation<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.360> leave<00:04:26.510> in<00:04:26.780> five<00:04:26.930> or

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
recommendation is to leave in five or

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.650 
recommendation is to leave in five or
ten<00:04:27.500> seconds<00:04:27.980> while<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.000> pen<00:04:29.240> gradually

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
ten seconds while the pen gradually

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.550 
ten seconds while the pen gradually
fills<00:04:29.870> with<00:04:30.140> ink<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:33.080> had<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.290> few

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
fills with ink and so that's had a few

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.490 
fills with ink and so that's had a few
seconds<00:04:33.980> that's<00:04:34.520> not<00:04:34.790> too<00:04:35.000> bad<00:04:35.360> now<00:04:36.290> we're

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
seconds that's not too bad now we're

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.330 
seconds that's not too bad now we're
just<00:04:36.620> going<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:39.430> screw<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.610> black<00:04:41.170> solidly

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
just going to screw that black solidly

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.010 
just going to screw that black solidly
so<00:04:43.340> there<00:04:43.520> won't<00:04:43.610> be<00:04:43.700> any<00:04:43.820> X<00:04:44.090> nothing<00:04:44.690> coming

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
so there won't be any X nothing coming

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.590 
so there won't be any X nothing coming
on<00:04:47.710> what<00:04:48.710> is<00:04:48.860> important<00:04:49.490> with<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.240> Visconti

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
on what is important with the Visconti

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.570 
on what is important with the Visconti
is<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.560> make<00:04:51.710> sure<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.190> take<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
is to make sure that you take the

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.030 
is to make sure that you take the
surface<00:04:53.150> eat<00:04:53.480> off<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.530> grip<00:04:54.740> area<00:04:57.040> being

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
surface eat off the grip area being

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.150 
surface eat off the grip area being
slightly<00:04:58.340> hydroscopic

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
slightly hydroscopic

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.800 
slightly hydroscopic
it<00:05:01.160> will<00:05:01.400> absorb<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.910> tiny<00:05:02.120> bit<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.450> this<00:05:02.540> ink

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
it will absorb a tiny bit of this ink

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.380 
it will absorb a tiny bit of this ink
now<00:05:03.320> actually<00:05:03.740> cleaning<00:05:04.040> removes<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:05.030> very

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
now actually cleaning removes it very

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.790 
now actually cleaning removes it very
effectively<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.290> it's<00:05:06.410> not<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.560> permanent

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
effectively so it's not a permanent

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.070 
effectively so it's not a permanent
problem<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:08.060> best<00:05:08.300> not<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.570> get<00:05:08.720> there<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:08.990> the

problem the best not to get there in the
first<00:05:09.260> place<00:05:09.880> okay<00:05:10.930> well<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:11.990> final<00:05:12.200> thing<00:05:12.530> is

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
first place okay well the final thing is

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.880 
first place okay well the final thing is
how<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.430> rides<00:05:14.230> but<00:05:15.230> I<00:05:15.260> think<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:15.650> writes

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
how it rides but I think it writes

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.430 
how it rides but I think it writes
