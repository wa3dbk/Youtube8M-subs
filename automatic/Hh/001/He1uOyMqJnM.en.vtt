00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 what are the people today in our review 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.370
 highscreen boost 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.060
 Pavel is the brightest smartphone of this 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.060
 manufacturer 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.090
 walk along till about you and so 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 know the main feature of the battery 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.360
 at 4160 milliampere hours here's the main one 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 reason to look at this device and to 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.919
 the engineers didn't try to smudge 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.509
 battery over the entire area of ​​the device for 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.599
 account of which the latter possess great 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.160
 thick ergonomics suffers from it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.650
 which is rather strange with such a small 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.810
 for a modern device diagonal yet 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.690
 that we will save the main piece for the final 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.930
 for now let's talk about the design as a whole 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 the unit looks like a comeback from the past 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 The huge control button is cleared 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.230
 as if it is now 2007 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.269
 and I have in my hands some rover pc and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.239
 this is by no means negative 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.879
 characteristic in appearance every kind is nice 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 Yes, and in the hands is as it should be 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.769
 holds and body material kick alas 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 doubt arises though I check and not 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.180
 decided and you can write it off on my 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.980
 close guessing except standard 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 key present and the activation button 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.810
 cameras but again someone about was lazy and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.050
 auto start like smartphones from 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.940
 sony, alas, did not finish both cameras here as 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.520
 and relies for a tick however in 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.920
 At this point you did not expect a breakthrough 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.050
 waited for him and from the speakers they give out 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630
 loud but fairly flat sound 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.970
 but what struck me so much is the screen 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.560
 the display is devoid of air gap for 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.530
 the bill of which the device looks like one 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.660
 black object juicy colors and excellent 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.190
 viewing angles here is what the definition serves 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.410
 for highscreen boost screen 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.240
 and the history of hitting his state employee and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.990
 made Russian roots believe 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.180
 apparatus 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.980
 as the story says was not originally 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.110
 planned to release this model with 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.630
 this display but on the assembly hall 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.070
 Something lured and in the end happy 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.620
 users got a quality 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.830
 product from sharp instead of standard 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.780
 the company pikes in all its products 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.520
 iron apparatus is also a good start up and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.400
 not the youngest but still a model 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
 snapdragon s4 with two cores and 1 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.429
 gigabytes of ram 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.379
 should have been enough to calm 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 working with android 4 1 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.350
 but the first firmware itself, alas, it turned out 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.270
 surprisingly brakes 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.670
 and while enjoying your favorite music 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.430
 Movies and simple toys are not 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.410
 make problems anyway about guys 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.740
 developers are up to date and maybe even 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.300
 fixed in a recent update 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.760
 Of course the main question is really 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.130
 is zipper empty answering that up 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.590
 You will need 2 intense days to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.390
 discharge it in normal mode 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.910
 probably a cold all the declared work 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.770
 a week is enough battery 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.100
 long flight from Moscow to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.110
 los angeles and even considering though 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.470
 honestly stunned face figures milliamps 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.080
 o'clock 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.240
 expected more pretty close 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.240
 results show and motorola max a 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.040
 he has a smaller battery with 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.050
 other side as such direct 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.810
 competitor to our guest today and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 no long-playing 2 sim and hicks 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.920
 high-quality screen 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 it's all about him highscreen boost with you 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.480
 was gropius bye bye
