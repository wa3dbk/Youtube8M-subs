00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.900

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.290
 during filming in front of the artist stands 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.460
 not an easy task to show 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.860
 beautiful picture 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.829
 but also to convey to the viewer a hidden meaning 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 I wonder if this was succeeded by the audience 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.730
 laugh I hope 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.800
 from so 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.829

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.860
 good mood and cool to hold 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:03.730

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 will produce 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.250
 good some impression will leave 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 memory will remember everything 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 recall Tim Burton remind e.g. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.940
 what's in the clip is a little unusual girl with 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.979
 Mars tried to survive in the conditions of the old 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.440
 soviet apartment and since the role 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.720
 Martian Ki was Julia herself I decided to find out 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.430
 and not 5 rules of which are necessary 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.610
 stick to survive in big 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.550
 city if you flew in from mars but judging 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.280
 according to our clip it is to have a husband to wash 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.870
 cat wash the dishes cook fighter or 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.550
 lay on your side 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.790
 limit without limits settled in your 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.210
 head for 8 sings Julia and the life of a girl with 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.400
 Mars 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.860
 and how much time in the head of a boy with 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.170
 Venus does it exist at all and most importantly 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.300
 will the song be appropriately named 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 you know, we will probably find out in 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.430
 next clip he seems to him 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.780
 should also be 8 they should like that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 at least coincide in some way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 after watching the video, I realized that I 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.350
 the typical girl who flew in with 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.450
 Venus get out and cook soup 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 then I can easily, unlike 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.740
 Martian key even in conditions 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.420
 harsh Soviet apartment hope you 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.280
 also did not confuse anything and flew 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 just stand the planet with which it is necessary 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.520
 and on this our report comes to an end with 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.520
 see you sun
