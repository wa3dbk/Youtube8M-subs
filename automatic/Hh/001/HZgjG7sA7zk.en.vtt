biceps<00:00:02.030> are<00:00:02.389> actually<00:00:02.929> only<00:00:03.290> about<00:00:03.709> thirty

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
biceps are actually only about thirty

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.030 
biceps are actually only about thirty
three<00:00:04.670> percent<00:00:04.700> of<00:00:05.149> the<00:00:05.210> arm<00:00:05.420> and<00:00:05.689> the<00:00:06.410> rest<00:00:06.920> of

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
three percent of the arm and the rest of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.770 
three percent of the arm and the rest of
the<00:00:07.130> arm<00:00:07.519> is<00:00:07.790> actually<00:00:08.300> made<00:00:08.450> up<00:00:08.600> by<00:00:08.720> the

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
the arm is actually made up by the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.890 
the arm is actually made up by the
tricep<00:00:09.260> and<00:00:09.530> it's<00:00:10.430> often<00:00:10.610> neglected<00:00:11.300> but<00:00:11.780> it

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
tricep and it's often neglected but it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.509 
tricep and it's often neglected but it
really<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.290> very<00:00:12.320> important<00:00:12.950> in<00:00:13.070> a<00:00:13.190> lot<00:00:13.340> of<00:00:13.370> the

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
really is very important in a lot of the

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:14.950 
really is very important in a lot of the
pressing<00:00:13.970> movements<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.570> pushing

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
pressing movements and the pushing

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.750 
pressing movements and the pushing
movements<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:15.590> if<00:00:16.099> you<00:00:16.160> really<00:00:16.309> want<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.610> have

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
movements and if you really want to have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.029 
movements and if you really want to have
nice<00:00:17.210> arms<00:00:17.450> that<00:00:17.780> look<00:00:17.960> good<00:00:18.110> both<00:00:18.680> from<00:00:18.920> the

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
nice arms that look good both from the

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.130 
nice arms that look good both from the
front<00:00:19.369> and<00:00:19.520> also<00:00:19.940> to<00:00:20.000> add<00:00:20.330> dimension<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:20.900> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
front and also to add dimension to the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.779 
front and also to add dimension to the
rest<00:00:21.320> of<00:00:21.410> your<00:00:21.470> body<00:00:21.680> you<00:00:22.190> really<00:00:22.430> have<00:00:22.580> to<00:00:22.670> do

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
rest of your body you really have to do

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.900 
rest of your body you really have to do
triceps<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:23.930> if<00:00:24.199> you<00:00:24.320> want<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:24.529> have<00:00:24.650> this<00:00:24.910> you

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
triceps so if you want to have this you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.970 
triceps so if you want to have this you
got<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.180> do<00:00:26.270> these<00:00:26.590> that's<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.740> bottom<00:00:27.949> line

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
got to do these that's the bottom line

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.519 
got to do these that's the bottom line
let<00:00:28.670> me<00:00:28.760> show<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:28.910> how<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.180> do<00:00:29.300> one<00:00:29.869> arm<00:00:29.990> tricep

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
let me show you how to do one arm tricep

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.239 
let me show you how to do one arm tricep
extensions<00:00:31.189> I<00:00:31.400> like<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.789> do<00:00:31.910> on<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.479> bench

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:33.249 
extensions I like to do on the bench

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:36.219 
extensions I like to do on the bench
like<00:00:34.249> this<00:00:34.489> as<00:00:35.359> a<00:00:35.420> matter<00:00:35.569> of<00:00:35.659> fact<00:00:35.749> this<00:00:36.199> is

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:38.479 
the only exercise aside from a couple of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.599 
the only exercise aside from a couple of
legs<00:00:38.690> exercises<00:00:39.379> where<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:39.679> actually<00:00:39.889> okay

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
legs exercises where it's actually okay

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.379 
legs exercises where it's actually okay
to<00:00:40.940> extend<00:00:41.539> your<00:00:41.899> arm<00:00:42.170> completely<00:00:43.389> I'm

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:44.389 
to extend your arm completely I'm

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.180 
to extend your arm completely I'm
actually<00:00:44.569> going<00:00:44.809> to<00:00:44.929> keep<00:00:45.079> this<00:00:45.319> arm<00:00:45.620> here<00:00:45.979> on

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
actually going to keep this arm here on

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.779 
actually going to keep this arm here on
the<00:00:46.940> tricep<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.859> I'm<00:00:48.859> going<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.069> brace<00:00:49.309> my<00:00:49.579> arm

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
the tricep and I'm going to brace my arm

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.459 
the tricep and I'm going to brace my arm
with<00:00:49.999> it<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.299> I'm<00:00:50.839> going<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.049> lower<00:00:51.260> the

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
with it and I'm going to lower the

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.069 
with it and I'm going to lower the
weight<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.879> opposite<00:00:53.479> side<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.839> my<00:00:54.049> chest

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
weight to the opposite side of my chest

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.730 
weight to the opposite side of my chest
and<00:00:56.109> then<00:00:57.109> extend<00:00:57.649> my<00:00:57.799> arm<00:00:58.010> completely

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.540 

it's<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.310> very<00:01:04.760> very<00:01:05.330> simple<00:01:05.810> movement<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's a very very simple movement but the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.030 
it's a very very simple movement but the
hard<00:01:07.850> part<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.360> actually<00:01:08.930> keeping<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.710> arm

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
hard part is actually keeping the arm

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.590 
hard part is actually keeping the arm
straight<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:11.360> not<00:01:12.110> doing<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:13.900> or<00:01:14.900> this<00:01:16.600> this

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
straight and not doing this or this this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.950 
straight and not doing this or this this
is<00:01:18.230> how<00:01:18.440> we<00:01:18.500> do<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> tricep<00:01:19.280> extension<00:01:19.850> at<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
is how we do the tricep extension at the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.740 
is how we do the tricep extension at the
top<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.440> exercise<00:01:21.920> we<00:01:22.850> actually<00:01:23.060> extend

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
top of the exercise we actually extend

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.230 
top of the exercise we actually extend
as<00:01:23.930> far<00:01:23.960> as<00:01:24.350> we<00:01:24.530> can<00:01:24.680> go<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.700> should<00:01:25.940> flex

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
as far as we can go and that should flex

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.780 
as far as we can go and that should flex
the<00:01:26.450> tricep<00:01:26.900> my<00:01:27.500> hands<00:01:28.010> although<00:01:28.250> I'm<00:01:28.430> holding

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
the tricep my hands although I'm holding

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.560 
the tricep my hands although I'm holding
the<00:01:28.880> weight<00:01:29.060> very<00:01:29.630> securely<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:31.700> relaxed<00:01:32.300> my

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
the weight very securely is relaxed my

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.420 
the weight very securely is relaxed my
hand<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:32.810> very<00:01:32.870> relaxed<00:01:33.470> this<00:01:33.920> arm<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.400> just

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
hand is very relaxed this arm is just

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.570 
hand is very relaxed this arm is just
for<00:01:34.880> guidance<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.560> I'm<00:01:36.560> letting<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.340> weights

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
for guidance and I'm letting the weights

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.140 
for guidance and I'm letting the weights
come<00:01:37.910> down<00:01:39.220> not<00:01:40.220> letting<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.550> touch<00:01:40.700> my<00:01:40.910> chest

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
come down not letting it touch my chest

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.270 
come down not letting it touch my chest
so<00:01:41.390> there's<00:01:41.570> still<00:01:41.780> tension<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.470> sort<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.190> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
so there's still tension and sort of a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.550 
so there's still tension and sort of a
stretch<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.880> tricep<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.510> then<00:01:44.960> extending

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
stretch in the tricep and then extending

00:01:45.560 --> 00:02:07.360 
stretch in the tricep and then extending
up<00:01:46.010> just<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:46.610> that

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.420 

now<00:02:07.990> we're<00:02:08.990> going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:09.320> changeup<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.130> this

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
now we're going to do a changeup on this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.820 
now we're going to do a changeup on this
exercise<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.870> change-up<00:02:12.380> looks<00:02:12.650> like

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
exercise to the change-up looks like

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:23.200 
exercise to the change-up looks like
this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.300 

and<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.900> would<00:02:24.050> not<00:02:24.200> believe<00:02:24.380> how<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:25.010> feels

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
and you would not believe how this feels

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:36.370 
and you would not believe how this feels
after<00:02:26.120> doing<00:02:26.600> several<00:02:27.170> repetitions<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.270> way

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.050 

you<00:02:36.860> should<00:02:37.040> actually<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.520> moving<00:02:37.940> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you should actually be moving the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.660 
you should actually be moving the
weights<00:02:38.800> slowly<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.280> under<00:02:41.120> control<00:02:42.670> however

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
weights slowly and under control however

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.210 
weights slowly and under control however
once<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.810> start<00:02:45.080> fatiguing<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.680> muscle<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
once you start fatiguing the muscle and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.540 
once you start fatiguing the muscle and
you<00:02:46.730> recognize<00:02:47.420> exactly<00:02:47.900> where<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.620> then

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
you recognize exactly where it is then

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.990 
you recognize exactly where it is then
you<00:02:49.700> can<00:02:49.850> start<00:02:51.130> pumping<00:02:52.130> iron<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> will

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you can start pumping iron if you will

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.230 
you can start pumping iron if you will
once<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.840> feel<00:02:54.080> very<00:02:54.350> secure<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:55.100> how<00:02:56.030> you're

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
once you feel very secure in how you're

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.140 
once you feel very secure in how you're
moving<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.780> weights<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.700> actually

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
moving the weights you can actually

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.090 
moving the weights you can actually
start<00:02:59.360> picking<00:02:59.780> up<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.050> momentum<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.800> about

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
start picking up the momentum to about

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.400 
start picking up the momentum to about
one<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.550> half<00:03:01.580> times<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.630> speed<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.320> were

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
one and a half times the speed you were

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.520 
one and a half times the speed you were
using<00:03:03.770> before<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:07.240> then<00:03:08.240> my<00:03:08.420> changeup<00:03:08.960> this

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
using before and then my changeup this

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.170 
using before and then my changeup this
is<00:03:09.680> what<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.920> looks<00:03:10.100> like

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.270 

I<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.319> exercise<00:03:19.650> first<00:03:22.280> because

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
I like to do this exercise first because

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.580 
I like to do this exercise first because
it's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.519> very<00:03:23.549> sharp<00:03:24.120> movement<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.079> involves

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it's a very sharp movement it involves

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.220 
it's a very sharp movement it involves
flexing<00:03:26.189> the<00:03:26.340> tricep<00:03:27.049> independent<00:03:28.049> from<00:03:28.200> the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
flexing the tricep independent from the

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.289 
flexing the tricep independent from the
way<00:03:28.469> and<00:03:28.769> if<00:03:29.189> I<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.340> my<00:03:29.609> other<00:03:29.760> tricep

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
way and if I get my other tricep

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.630 
way and if I get my other tricep
exercises<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:31.379> I'm<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:32.069> not<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
exercises going I'm really not going to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.729 
exercises going I'm really not going to
have<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:32.849> same<00:03:33.359> kind<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.750> sensation<00:03:34.170> because

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
have that same kind of sensation because

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.589 
have that same kind of sensation because
my<00:03:34.980> triceps<00:03:35.430> are<00:03:35.489> going<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.060> filled<00:03:36.389> up

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
my triceps are going to be so filled up

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.319 
my triceps are going to be so filled up
and<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.260> feeling<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:37.980> powerful<00:03:38.549> I'm<00:03:38.730> not<00:03:39.150> going

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
and so feeling so powerful I'm not going

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.119 
and so feeling so powerful I'm not going
to<00:03:39.389> really<00:03:39.569> be<00:03:39.810> able<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.019> make<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.319> superior

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
to really be able to make that superior

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.039 
to really be able to make that superior
