00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.520 
to get the 25 because it was right in
the<00:02:59.239> middle<00:02:59.420> from<00:02:59.720> all<00:02:59.840> those<00:02:59.959> choices<00:03:00.200> they

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the middle from all those choices they

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.500 
the middle from all those choices they
had<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.220> because<00:03:01.580> my<00:03:01.730> hair<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.060> super

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
had and because my hair is that super

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.380 
had and because my hair is that super
long<00:03:02.690> that's<00:03:02.930> only<00:03:03.049> two<00:03:03.230> about<00:03:03.410> here<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.390> when

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
long that's only two about here so when

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.180 
long that's only two about here so when
you<00:03:05.420> have<00:03:05.660> longer<00:03:05.900> hair<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.620> feel<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.010> a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
you have longer hair I feel like a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.500 
you have longer hair I feel like a
thicker<00:03:07.459> one<00:03:07.640> will<00:03:07.790> be<00:03:07.880> better<00:03:08.060> because<00:03:08.269> it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
thicker one will be better because it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.270 
thicker one will be better because it
would<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.780> bigger<00:03:09.049> waves<00:03:09.350> since<00:03:09.950> my<00:03:10.130> hair

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
would just be bigger waves since my hair

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.620 
would just be bigger waves since my hair
is<00:03:10.370> not<00:03:10.459> really<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.760> long<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.209> didn't<00:03:11.450> want<00:03:11.570> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
is not really that long I didn't want to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.390 
is not really that long I didn't want to
get<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.079> was<00:03:12.230> too<00:03:12.739> big<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.100> barrel

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
get one that was too big of a barrel

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.650 
get one that was too big of a barrel
because<00:03:13.549> then<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.030> would<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.390> kind<00:03:14.510> of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
because then it would just be kind of

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.240 
because then it would just be kind of
just<00:03:14.870> body<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.530> wanted<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.859> little<00:03:16.040> bit<00:03:16.190> more

I<00:04:58.480> thought<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.840> would<00:04:59.020> try<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.230> so<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.889> definitely

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
I thought I would try it so I definitely

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.460 
I thought I would try it so I definitely
love<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.030> if<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:01.450> have<00:05:01.600> my<00:05:01.780> length<00:05:02.050> hair<00:05:02.320> or

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
love it if you have my length hair or

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.900 
love it if you have my length hair or
even<00:05:02.530> maybe<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.889> little<00:05:03.040> bit<00:05:03.220> shorter<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.760> would

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
even maybe a little bit shorter I would

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.340 
even maybe a little bit shorter I would
recommend<00:05:04.300> this<00:05:04.419> size<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.050> have<00:05:05.080> long

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
recommend this size if you have long

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.600 
recommend this size if you have long
hair<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.590> think<00:05:05.860> you'd<00:05:06.010> even<00:05:06.130> get<00:05:06.280> away<00:05:06.400> with<00:05:06.550> a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
hair I think you'd even get away with a

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.860 
hair I think you'd even get away with a
bigger<00:05:06.790> one<00:05:06.850> because<00:05:07.450> I<00:05:07.540> don't<00:05:07.600> would<00:05:07.750> just

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
bigger one because I don't would just

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.840 
bigger one because I don't would just
give<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.080> more<00:05:08.680> loose<00:05:08.919> waves<00:05:09.190> depends<00:05:09.639> what's

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
give you more loose waves depends what's

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.580 
give you more loose waves depends what's
there<00:05:10.000> but<00:05:10.090> what<00:05:10.240> you're<00:05:10.360> looking<00:05:10.540> for<00:05:10.720> so
