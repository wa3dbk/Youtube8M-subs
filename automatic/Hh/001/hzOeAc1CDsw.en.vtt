2:25 here I'm gonna try to explain you
how<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.830> did<00:00:05.310> my<00:00:05.520> wings<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.089> landing<00:00:06.330> here<00:00:06.660> on

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
how I did my wings and landing here on

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.790 
how I did my wings and landing here on
my<00:00:06.930> leg<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.259> md-11<00:00:08.929> this<00:00:09.929> was<00:00:10.080> requested<00:00:10.620> by<00:00:10.650> a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
my leg of md-11 this was requested by a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.150 
my leg of md-11 this was requested by a
Ragnar<00:00:11.639> striker<00:00:14.030> former<00:00:15.030> named<00:00:15.240> speed<00:00:15.660> MK<00:00:16.289> 787

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Ragnar striker former named speed MK 787

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.759 
Ragnar striker former named speed MK 787
he's<00:00:17.640> gonna<00:00:17.820> build<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.380> 340<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> believe<00:00:21.769> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
he's gonna build an a 340 I believe and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
he's gonna build an a 340 I believe and
that<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.010> something<00:00:23.250> different

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that was something different

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.429 
that was something different
anyways<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.650> promised<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> would<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.220> this

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
anyways I promised you I would do this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:36.049 
anyways I promised you I would do this
later<00:00:31.969> and<00:00:33.110> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> basically<00:00:35.059> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
later and this is basically the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.869 
later and this is basically the
difference<00:00:36.239> between<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.950> wing<00:00:38.129> attached<00:00:38.579> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
difference between the wing attached and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.600 
difference between the wing attached and
the<00:00:38.940> wing<00:00:39.090> detached<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> yeah<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.460> was<00:00:44.460> gonna

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the wing detached so yeah I was gonna

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
the wing detached so yeah I was gonna
quickly<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:46.950> done

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
quickly show you how this is done

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.750 
quickly show you how this is done
because<00:00:47.700> basically<00:00:48.289> here's<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> wing<00:00:49.760> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
because basically here's the wing this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
because basically here's the wing this
is<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> leading<00:00:51.390> edge<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.469> wing<00:00:52.980> base<00:00:54.980> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
is the leading edge of the wing base so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.939 
is the leading edge of the wing base so
you<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.170> pretty<00:00:58.170> pretty

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you see it's it's it's pretty pretty

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
you see it's it's it's pretty pretty
pretty<00:00:59.370> thick<00:00:59.879> there's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> space<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pretty thick there's a lot of space in

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.490 
pretty thick there's a lot of space in
between<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.899> space<00:01:04.140> over

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
between and there's some space over

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.210 
between and there's some space over
there<00:01:05.180> I'm<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:09.470> get<00:01:10.470> split<00:01:10.740> over<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there I'm just gonna get split over in a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.510 
there I'm just gonna get split over in a
sec<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.869> look<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.140> does<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.100> hinge<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sec so look at this does it so hinge to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
sec so look at this does it so hinge to
remember<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.240> remember<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
remember that one remember so this is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
remember that one remember so this is
what<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> plane<00:01:17.880> looks<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.390> upside<00:01:18.840> down

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
what the plane looks like upside down

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.820 
what the plane looks like upside down
and<00:01:20.180> basically<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:24.650> grab<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and basically I'm just gonna grab the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.020 
and basically I'm just gonna grab the
other<00:01:25.950> ring<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.140> wing

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
other ring here this is the wing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.359 
other ring here this is the wing
there's<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.420> three<00:01:30.750> points<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> which

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
there's actually three points on which

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.649 
there's actually three points on which
it<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> attached<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> rest<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it is attached to the to the rest of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
it is attached to the to the rest of the
plane<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:45.350> which

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
plane so there's this point which

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.179 
plane so there's this point which
actually<00:01:46.710> fits<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
actually fits right in here like this

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.929 
actually fits right in here like this
I'm<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.549> doing<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:52.939> I'm

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
I'm not doing this right actually I'm

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm not doing this right actually I'm
gonna<00:01:54.060> remove<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:57.110> basically<00:01:58.110> if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
gonna remove this one and basically if

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.480 
gonna remove this one and basically if
we<00:01:59.070> put<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> wing<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> here

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.180 

you<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.880> point<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.630> connected<00:02:07.190> like

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you see this point is connected like

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.630 
you see this point is connected like
that<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:09.210> nicely<00:02:10.310> fits<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:13.640> then

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that just nicely fits in there then

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.210 
that just nicely fits in there then
there's<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.150> hinge<00:02:15.480> which<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.740> goes<00:02:17.010> in

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
there's this hinge which just goes in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.490 
there's this hinge which just goes in
there<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.360> later<00:02:18.570> covered<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.140> by

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there and which is later covered up by

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.390 
there and which is later covered up by
this<00:02:20.400> plate<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.990> finally<00:02:22.100> there's<00:02:23.100> two

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
this plate and finally there's two

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.660 
this plate and finally there's two
hinges<00:02:23.790> here<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:27.530> there<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.459> top

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
hinges here one so there one on the top

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.020 
hinges here one so there one on the top
and<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.950> wing<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.310> maybe

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and one on the in the wing and maybe

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.050 
and one on the in the wing and maybe
there<00:02:33.270> will<00:02:33.660> follow<00:02:34.410> one<00:02:34.709> honored<00:02:35.550> wish<00:02:35.730> but

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
there will follow one honored wish but

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.130 
there will follow one honored wish but
obviously<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:38.070> not<00:02:38.100> finished<00:02:38.370> yet<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:39.140> so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
obviously it's not finished yet there so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.290 
obviously it's not finished yet there so
here<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.400> everything<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.880> covered<00:02:42.180> up

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
here we see everything is covered up

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.650 
here we see everything is covered up
nicely<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:44.120> basically<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.360> wings<00:02:45.510> are

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
nicely and basically if the wings are

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.060 
nicely and basically if the wings are
attached<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:49.140> cover<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.830> up

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
attached like that to cover this all up

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.560 
attached like that to cover this all up
I<00:02:50.570> came<00:02:51.570> up<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:53.270> basically<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.390> can

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I came up with this basically you can

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.790 
I came up with this basically you can
just<00:02:54.800> put<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> right<00:02:55.950> over<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:57.620> there's<00:02:58.620> some

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
just put it right over here there's some

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.640 
just put it right over here there's some
smooth<00:02:59.100> tiles<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.260> really

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
smooth tiles here and this just really

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.130 
smooth tiles here and this just really
covers<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> wing<00:03:03.200> very<00:03:04.200> nicely<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.959> that's

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
covers up the wing very nicely so that's

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.090 
covers up the wing very nicely so that's
it<00:03:07.380> for<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.130> wings<00:03:08.690> basically<00:03:09.830> you've<00:03:10.830> seen

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
it for the wings basically you've seen

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.199 
it for the wings basically you've seen
how<00:03:11.310> thick<00:03:12.299> my<00:03:12.330> wings<00:03:12.810> are<00:03:13.019> oh<00:03:13.730> here's<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
how thick my wings are oh here's the is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.670 
how thick my wings are oh here's the is
the<00:03:15.360> landing<00:03:15.600> gear<00:03:15.750> door<00:03:15.959> actually<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:19.590> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the landing gear door actually this is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.970 
the landing gear door actually this is
just<00:03:19.830> very<00:03:19.890> easy<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.750> fuselage<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.799> is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
just very easy in the fuselage there is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.789 
just very easy in the fuselage there is
a<00:03:23.160> big<00:03:23.760> space<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.350> landing<00:03:25.650> gear

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
a big space here for the landing gear

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.830 
a big space here for the landing gear
and<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> wing<00:03:26.940> there's<00:03:27.180> dispatch<00:03:27.660> for

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and in the wing there's dispatch for

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.890 
and in the wing there's dispatch for
landing<00:03:28.170> gear<00:03:28.670> now<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.730> wing<00:03:30.030> base<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.630> really

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
landing gear now the wing base is really

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.970 
landing gear now the wing base is really
strong<00:03:31.489> because<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.940> by<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.390> way<00:03:33.680> because<00:03:34.680> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
strong because is by the way because I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370 
strong because is by the way because I
got<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.370> long<00:03:35.760> beams<00:03:36.420> running<00:03:36.930> through

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
got these long beams running through

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.650 
got these long beams running through
here<00:03:38.360> maybe<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.540> see<00:03:39.840> right<00:03:40.140> there<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
here maybe you see right there and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.199 
here maybe you see right there and
there's<00:03:42.660> another<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:43.110> inside<00:03:43.260> there<00:03:44.209> there's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
there's another one inside there there's

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.660 
there's another one inside there there's
a<00:03:45.330> few<00:03:45.600> more<00:03:45.840> over<00:03:46.260> there<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> then<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.459> run

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
a few more over there and then just run

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.509 
a few more over there and then just run
through<00:03:47.910> here<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:49.440> some<00:03:50.100> sort<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:51.920> eight<00:03:52.920> eight

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
through here in some sort of eight eight

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.270 
through here in some sort of eight eight
eight<00:03:53.850> while<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.510> storm<00:03:54.840> already<00:03:54.989> eight<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:56.100> an

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
eight while a storm already eight in an

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.789 
eight while a storm already eight in an
inn<00:03:56.459> oh<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.450> know<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:58.110> square

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
inn oh like that you know in square

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.720 
inn oh like that you know in square
or<00:03:59.640> square<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.150> rectangle

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.399 

yeah<00:04:05.730> Aires<00:04:06.000> here<00:04:06.360> here<00:04:06.629> here<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.019> see<00:04:07.230> them

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
yeah Aires here here here you see them

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.460 
yeah Aires here here here you see them
still<00:04:08.750> laxative<00:04:09.750> next<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.200> flaps<00:04:12.470> that's

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
still laxative next to the flaps that's

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.069 
still laxative next to the flaps that's
what<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:13.829> makes<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.220> strong<00:04:15.079> because

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
what really makes this strong because

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.920 
what really makes this strong because
this<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.590> one<00:04:16.739> big<00:04:17.070> wing<00:04:17.880> which<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.329> flat

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
this is just one big wing which is flat

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.540 
this is just one big wing which is flat
on<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:20.780> fuselage<00:04:21.780> or<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:23.190> landing<00:04:23.400> gear

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
on the fuselage or the landing gear

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.300 
on the fuselage or the landing gear
itself<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:25.669> basically<00:04:27.710> I'll<00:04:28.710> just<00:04:28.770> grab<00:04:29.100> this

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
itself is basically I'll just grab this

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.740 
itself is basically I'll just grab this
off<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:29.820> basically<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.210> these<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:32.750> know

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
off it's basically just these I know

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.700 
off it's basically just these I know
what<00:04:33.900> they're<00:04:33.990> called<00:04:34.229> and<00:04:35.030> they're<00:04:36.710> stuffed

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
what they're called and they're stuffed

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:47.379 
what they're called and they're stuffed
in<00:04:37.919> in<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.600> tube<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:44.539> things

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
in in this in this tube of of things

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.969 
in in this in this tube of of things
basically<00:04:48.389> this<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.750> just<00:04:48.780> static<00:04:49.199> so<00:04:49.590> just

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
basically this is just static so just

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:58.450 
basically this is just static so just
gonna<00:04:50.510> take<00:04:51.510> this<00:04:51.750> off

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.159 

basically<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.699> landing<00:05:00.000> gear<00:05:00.120> attracts<00:05:00.660> very

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
basically the landing gear attracts very

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.400 
basically the landing gear attracts very
easily<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.949> connected<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:03.410> just

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
easily and it's just connected it just

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.960 
easily and it's just connected it just
stands<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.070> which<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:08.419> these<00:05:09.419> are<00:05:09.630> two<00:05:10.970> 1

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
stands on this which is these are two 1

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.040 
stands on this which is these are two 1
by<00:05:12.150> 2's<00:05:12.479> 1<00:05:13.199> or<00:05:13.349> 2<00:05:13.470> bricks<00:05:14.010> with<00:05:14.940> two<00:05:15.479> holes<00:05:15.840> in

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
by 2's 1 or 2 bricks with two holes in

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.070 
by 2's 1 or 2 bricks with two holes in
there<00:05:16.260> on<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.250> on<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.520> sides<00:05:17.760> this<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:18.900> just

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
there on the on the sides this is just

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.020 
there on the on the sides this is just
really<00:05:19.710> easily<00:05:20.039> connected<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.760> there<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:23.030> mean

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
really easily connected in there I mean

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.960 
really easily connected in there I mean
it's<00:05:24.449> just<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:25.139> really<00:05:25.470> simple<00:05:25.680> actually

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
it's just it's really simple actually

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.149 
it's just it's really simple actually
let's<00:05:26.970> not<00:05:27.270> do<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:28.680> landing<00:05:28.949> gear<00:05:29.070> itself

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
let's not do it the landing gear itself

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:38.110 
let's not do it the landing gear itself
I<00:05:34.610> hope<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.970> hope<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.240> can<00:05:36.389> see<00:05:36.599> if<00:05:36.659> ah<00:05:36.750> well
