00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.089 
do they play I think like during the
week<00:05:36.729> because<00:05:36.940> we<00:05:37.120> work<00:05:37.570> pretty<00:05:37.870> hard

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
week because we work pretty hard

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.409 
week because we work pretty hard
learning<00:05:39.099> our<00:05:39.340> moves<00:05:39.550> in<00:05:39.669> our<00:05:39.789> sequences<00:05:40.240> and

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
learning our moves in our sequences and

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.350 
learning our moves in our sequences and
then<00:05:41.199> you've<00:05:41.380> got<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.860> thought<00:05:42.610> what<00:05:42.909> the

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
then you've got a I thought what the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.750 
then you've got a I thought what the
opposition<00:05:44.139> does<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.250> think<00:05:45.280> if<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.610> do

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
opposition does and I think if you do

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.490 
opposition does and I think if you do
the<00:05:45.789> homework<00:05:46.120> during<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.229> way<00:05:47.320> that's

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
the homework during the way that's

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.710 
the homework during the way that's
pretty<00:05:47.680> much<00:05:47.860> the<00:05:48.610> part<00:05:48.880> where<00:05:49.120> you're

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
pretty much the part where you're

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.379 
pretty much the part where you're
working<00:05:49.840> hard<00:05:50.229> and<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:52.090> know<00:05:52.210> if<00:05:52.270> you're

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
working hard and you know if you're

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.060 
working hard and you know if you're
pretty<00:05:52.870> much<00:05:52.990> covered<00:05:53.320> on<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.590> tech<00:05:53.770> and<00:05:53.800> D

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
pretty much covered on the tech and D

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.860 
pretty much covered on the tech and D
then<00:05:54.580> in<00:05:54.729> the<00:05:54.849> game<00:05:54.970> you're<00:05:55.180> just<00:05:55.330> having<00:05:55.750> fun

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
then in the game you're just having fun

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.570 
then in the game you're just having fun
really<00:05:56.080> stop<00:05:56.409> playing<00:05:56.889> the<00:05:56.979> game<00:05:57.099> having<00:05:57.400> fun

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
really stop playing the game having fun

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.939 
really stop playing the game having fun
Ozzy<00:05:58.510> you've<00:05:58.630> long<00:05:58.870> been<00:05:58.900> regarded<00:05:59.349> as<00:05:59.740> one<00:05:59.800> of

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
Ozzy you've long been regarded as one of

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.189 
Ozzy you've long been regarded as one of
the<00:06:00.099> more<00:06:00.220> intelligent<00:06:00.520> sides<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.330> really

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
the more intelligent sides and really

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.320 
the more intelligent sides and really
well-educated<00:06:02.590> sides<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:03.880> what<00:06:04.000> happens<00:06:04.240> if

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
well-educated sides so what happens if

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.640 
well-educated sides so what happens if
you<00:06:04.449> go<00:06:04.599> out<00:06:04.780> with<00:06:05.050> this<00:06:05.320> is<00:06:05.409> how<00:06:05.530> they're

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
you go out with this is how they're

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.350 
you go out with this is how they're
going<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.830> play<00:06:06.010> us<00:06:06.159> in<00:06:06.400> its<00:06:06.760> completely

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
going to play us in its completely

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.409 
going to play us in its completely
different<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:08.220> think<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.550> last<00:06:09.729> couple<00:06:10.360> years

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
different I think the last couple years

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.290 
different I think the last couple years
with<00:06:11.250> predetermined<00:06:12.250> what<00:06:12.669> I've<00:06:13.060> done<00:06:13.240> you

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
with predetermined what I've done you

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.810 
with predetermined what I've done you
know<00:06:13.449> then<00:06:13.690> they<00:06:14.349> kind<00:06:14.560> of<00:06:14.650> catch<00:06:14.800> us<00:06:14.949> out<00:06:15.070> so

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
know then they kind of catch us out so

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.930 
know then they kind of catch us out so
that's<00:06:16.000> what<00:06:16.300> we<00:06:16.419> try<00:06:16.659> and<00:06:16.690> avoid<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.940> planning

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
that's what we try and avoid is planning

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.060 
that's what we try and avoid is planning
for<00:06:18.970> them<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.509> you<00:06:20.169> know<00:06:20.199> if<00:06:20.349> they<00:06:20.440> go<00:06:20.560> wide<00:06:20.800> and

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
for them to you know if they go wide and

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.620 
for them to you know if they go wide and
maybe<00:06:21.430> if<00:06:21.580> that<00:06:21.729> anger<00:06:21.970> why<00:06:22.120> they<00:06:22.270> might<00:06:22.450> kick

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
maybe if that anger why they might kick

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.149 
maybe if that anger why they might kick
it<00:06:22.750> because<00:06:23.620> they've<00:06:23.740> got<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.860> lot<00:06:23.979> of<00:06:24.010> cooking

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
it because they've got a lot of cooking

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.869 
it because they've got a lot of cooking
strategy

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
strategy

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.999 
strategy
in<00:06:25.059> there<00:06:25.240> in<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:26.139> game<00:06:26.349> The<00:06:26.529> Australian's

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
and so we just try and counteract that

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.749 
and so we just try and counteract that
when<00:06:30.629> preparing<00:06:31.629> during<00:06:31.869> the<00:06:31.959> week<00:06:32.759> you're
