is a fire pit that I made I think about

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.079 
is a fire pit that I made I think about
three<00:00:37.649> years<00:00:37.890> ago<00:00:40.550> me<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:41.729> roommates

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
decided to be one of the fire pit and I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
decided to be one of the fire pit and I
didn't<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> buy<00:00:44.970> one<00:00:45.269> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.570> went<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
didn't want to buy one so I went to the
local<00:00:46.050> home<00:00:46.409> depot<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.040> improvise<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.729> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
local home depot and just improvise it I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
about to pull up to lowes will go inside

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
about to pull up to lowes will go inside
and<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.470> said<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.710> made<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.100> fire<00:01:11.280> pit<00:01:11.520> about

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and like I said I made my fire pit about

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.249 
and like I said I made my fire pit about
three<00:01:11.909> years<00:01:12.060> ago<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.509> I<00:01:12.540> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.780> improvised

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
three years ago and I kind of improvised

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.569 
three years ago and I kind of improvised
it<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.799> had<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.040> home<00:01:14.130> depot<00:01:14.490> at

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
it with what they had at home depot at

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.249 
it with what they had at home depot at
the<00:01:14.670> time<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.420> we'll<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.049> cobble

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the time so we'll see what we can cobble

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
the time so we'll see what we can cobble
together<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.829> lowes<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.759> there's<00:01:18.149> three

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
together from lowes so there's three

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
together from lowes so there's three
basic<00:01:18.750> components<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.829> fire<00:01:20.070> pit<00:01:20.399> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
basic components to the fire pit the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
basic components to the fire pit the
first<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.380> gardening<00:01:22.979> fences

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
first are these little gardening fences

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
cents each I'll show you how to put

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
cents each I'll show you how to put
those<00:01:28.020> together<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> minute<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:29.250> next

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
those together in a minute the next

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
those together in a minute the next
component<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.120> high<00:01:30.780> heat<00:01:31.170> rust-oleum<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
component is high heat rust-oleum you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.770

fences<00:02:13.200> together<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.879> way<00:02:15.000> these

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
fences together so the way these

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.759 
fences together so the way these
gardening<00:02:15.659> fences<00:02:15.989> work<00:02:16.140> these<00:02:16.260> particular

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
gardening fences work these particular

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.250 
gardening fences work these particular
ones<00:02:16.799> they<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> little<00:02:17.610> loop<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.720> each<00:02:18.780> end

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
ones they have a little loop on each end

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.600 
ones they have a little loop on each end
and<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.500> way<00:02:19.620> they're<00:02:19.799> meant<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.099> used<00:02:20.340> as

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
and the way they're meant to be used as

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.670 
and the way they're meant to be used as
you<00:02:20.760> stick<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.360> ground<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.470> next

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you stick one in the ground and the next

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.740 
you stick one in the ground and the next
one<00:02:22.799> goes<00:02:22.980> into<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> loop<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.330> previous

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
one goes into the loop of the previous

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570 
one goes into the loop of the previous
one<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.680> keep<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:26.069> as<00:02:26.189> far<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
one and you can keep going as far as you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.399 
one and you can keep going as far as you
want<00:02:26.819> we're<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.689> use<00:02:27.810> these<00:02:27.959> actually

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the loop upside down you're going to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
the loop upside down you're going to
take<00:02:37.049> your<00:02:37.109> third<00:02:37.560> fence<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:39.920> as<00:02:40.920> my<00:02:41.099> British
