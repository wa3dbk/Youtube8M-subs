going to be able to pull it off when I
had<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> mask<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.820> think<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.909> made<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
had the mask on I think that made me a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.880 
had the mask on I think that made me a
much<00:01:15.420> better<00:01:15.619> performer<00:01:16.790> because<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
much better performer because I had to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
much better performer because I had to
you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:19.920> elicit<00:01:20.750> emotion<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:22.140> using<00:01:22.350> body

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you know elicit emotion by using body

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
you know elicit emotion by using body
language<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.390> how<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.720> have

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
language and and that's how I would have

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
language and and that's how I would have
to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.170> across<00:01:25.350> things<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> audience

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to get across things to the audience

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
to get across things to the audience
right<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> knew<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:31.049> know

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
right so I knew because of that you know

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.550 
right so I knew because of that you know
that<00:01:31.409> once<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.740> took<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> mask<00:01:32.220> off<00:01:33.079> I<00:01:34.079> would

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that once I took the mask off I would

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
that once I took the mask off I would
also<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.829> able<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.340> face<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
also be able to use my face and so I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.670 
also be able to use my face and so I
thought<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.140> me<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.619> much

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
thought that would make me that much

made the you know made Kane that much

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.240 
made the you know made Kane that much
more<00:03:14.700> messed<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.150> because<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.530> if

more messed up because you know if if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.830 
more messed up because you know if if
the<00:03:17.460> scars<00:03:17.760> were<00:03:17.940> real<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.480> he<00:03:18.570> put<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the scars were real then he put on a

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050 
the scars were real then he put on a
mask<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.410> understand<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.920> but<00:03:20.730> he

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
mask you to understand that but he

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.750 
mask you to understand that but he
really<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.870> monster<00:03:22.580> psychologically<00:03:23.580> if

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
really is a monster psychologically if

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.370 
really is a monster psychologically if
the<00:03:23.940> scars<00:03:24.239> were<00:03:24.510> never<00:03:24.750> there<00:03:25.020> but<00:03:25.260> he

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the scars were never there but he

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.350 
the scars were never there but he
thought<00:03:25.620> they<00:03:25.800> were<00:03:25.860> there<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.820> his

thought they were there and it was his

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
thought they were there and it was his
own<00:03:27.570> self<00:03:27.900> image<00:03:28.110> which<00:03:28.500> had<00:03:28.680> been<00:03:28.890> distorted

own self image which had been distorted

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.190 
own self image which had been distorted

of<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.770> things<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.070> remember<00:03:38.130> at<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.610> time

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
of the things I remember at the time

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.830 
of the things I remember at the time
it's<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.150> those<00:03:39.209> moments<00:03:39.450> where<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.810> just

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
it's one of those moments where you just

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.570 
it's one of those moments where you just
really<00:03:40.170> hate<00:03:40.380> wrestling<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.040> I'd<00:03:41.340> bought

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
really hate wrestling that I'd bought

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.070 
really hate wrestling that I'd bought
into<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.880> idea<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.360> character<00:03:42.750> as<00:03:42.840> Cain

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
into this idea of this character as Cain

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.140 
into this idea of this character as Cain
and<00:03:43.320> he's<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:43.830> ugly<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.220> his<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:44.610> disfigured

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and he's so ugly and his so disfigured

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.280 
and he's so ugly and his so disfigured
and<00:03:45.239> that's<00:03:45.390> why<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> can't<00:03:45.780> show<00:03:45.959> his<00:03:46.080> face

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
and that's why I can't show his face

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.410 
and that's why I can't show his face
right<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.070> then<00:03:47.160> at<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.489> moment<00:03:47.550> oh<00:03:48.090> look

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
right and then at that moment oh look

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.320 
right and then at that moment oh look
he's<00:03:48.570> all<00:03:48.690> right<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.140> got<00:03:49.290> bit<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.530> dirt<00:03:50.330> in

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
he's all right it's got bit of dirt in

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.900 
he's all right it's got bit of dirt in
here<00:03:51.450> well<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:53.040> certainly<00:03:53.310> could<00:03:53.640> go<00:03:53.760> that

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
here well and certainly could go that

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
here well and certainly could go that
way<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.239> also<00:03:54.360> think<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.020> people

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
way but I also think that the people

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.290 
way but I also think that the people
would<00:03:55.560> go<00:03:55.709> we've<00:03:56.130> been<00:03:56.370> told<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.030> stuff

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
would go we've been told all this stuff

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.570 
would go we've been told all this stuff
and<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:57.989> not<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.440> way<00:03:58.650> everybody's<00:03:59.459> going

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
and it's not that way everybody's going

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.070 
and it's not that way everybody's going
to<00:03:59.610> have<00:03:59.670> their<00:03:59.790> different<00:04:00.360> interpretation

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
to have their different interpretation

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.250 
to have their different interpretation
of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.470> way<00:04:01.590> they<00:04:01.739> look<00:04:01.770> at<00:04:02.130> it
