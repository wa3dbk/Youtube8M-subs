00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.000
 today it's about zucchini with cheese 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 is a very easy recipe very economical and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 very tasty we start with the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.269
 ingredients of course are pumpkins 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.560
 I'm using three pumpkins 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:30.210
 Mexicans that as we know it here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.230
 they're great I'm using a can 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.379
 of corn kernels a little less than a 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.089
 cup of chopped white onion cheese 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.790
 fresh chopped pepper evaporated milk 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.540
 it's half a cup 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.650
 I'm using three tomato tomatoes 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.510
 as you call it aroma and salt and a 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.350
 little oil 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.330
 Well we started well then we will 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.970
 apply our pumpkins this we're going 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.970
 to apply half way through 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.940
 then we are going to cut them in half 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.300
 but if they are very big because 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:21.640
 you cut more smaller ones ok 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.760
 in half and we're going to cut stockings 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 slices do not make them too thick 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.800
 look 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 I'll show you look 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.750
 is the size 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.289
 then we are going to chop all of that 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289
 Same size 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.720
 it's so you do not get desperate 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 i 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.830

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.280
 Well, all our 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.550
 chopped ingredients we already apply here 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.480
 the zucchini and everything is already chopped 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 ready to start 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.550
 Well, in a saucepan, today it removes 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.420
 they have put a little oil 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:11.420
 like three tablespoons of oil 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.420
 now let's add the pumpkins 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.500
 come back a little 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.189
 and then we are going to add the tomato 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.189
 and the onion 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.980
 it was not with the tomato 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.960
 I 'm going to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.340
 let's put some salt so that the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.340
 pumpkin start to drop a little 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.350
 we are not going to scale completely 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.390
 and let's put some pepper 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.610
 He says his taste do not put it much because 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.300
 then it will remove the Aryan flavor 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.300
 client 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.390
 I had told them that we had 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.390
 half cup 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.950
 of evaporated milk let's take the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.950
 half of this 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:11.599
 and we're going to cover over medium low heat ok and 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.670
 let's wait for the pumpkin to come loose 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.239
 a little juices and that you can cook 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.239
 all 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.830
 it's good time to review how they're going 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.830
 our pumpkins 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.800
 we are also going to stir a bit already 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.990
 they are a little more cooked they are made 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.470
 a kind as of 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.610
 like from balls because that's where milk 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.870
 also because it is cooked 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.870
 of people well what 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.480
 Now let's put the granites of 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.480
 corn cob 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.750
 let's put a little more salt 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.110
 this salt is pure does not have others 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.330
 ingredients and that comes out a little bit 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:34.360
 less need to use a little more 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.360
 but it does not matter it's very good health 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.770
 let's put the other part of the milk 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.870
 and if necessary put more milk ok 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.590
 It has to clear and a color as if 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.590
 half white 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.930
 Sometimes if it's a very good cheese 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.780
 for example for the girls who are in 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.980
 mexico not sometimes you do not need that much 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:15.100
 milk because the cheese good that good 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.070
 Well let's see that they are already little legs 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.400
 and we are going to tell you what is it 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.400

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.300

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.750

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.970

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.970
 Now let's add the cheese 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.369
 that is the amount that you 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.339
 want 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.870
 if you like that much 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:50.000
