just going to go ahead and tell you guys
about<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.680> after<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.400> long<00:00:20.760> thought<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.449> think

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
about it so after a long thought I think

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.439 
about it so after a long thought I think
I'm<00:00:21.960> gonna<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.260> changing<00:00:22.560> well<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.640> know<00:00:23.910> I'm

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

gonna be changing my channel username
and<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.510> reason<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and the reason for that is because I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.240 
and the reason for that is because I
just<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.510> username<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.099> bit

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
just think my username it's just a bit

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
just think my username it's just a bit
too<00:00:32.399> hard<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.880> pronounce<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:34.110> lot<00:00:34.530> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
too hard to pronounce and a lot of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.520 
too hard to pronounce and a lot of
people<00:00:34.680> tend<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> struggle<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
people tend to struggle with the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
people tend to struggle with the
pronunciation<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:38.160> username<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
pronunciation of my username and for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
pronunciation of my username and for
those<00:00:39.809> who<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:41.000> my<00:00:42.000> name<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.329> based

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
those who don't know my name is based

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.680 
those who don't know my name is based
off<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> character<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.980> Game<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> Thrones

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
off a character from Game of Thrones

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.709 
off a character from Game of Thrones
because<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:46.050> um<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.700> name<00:00:47.879> isn't<00:00:48.300> Kaylee

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because I see um so my name isn't Kaylee

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.860 
because I see um so my name isn't Kaylee
or<00:00:48.930> Kelly<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:50.910> he'll<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.239> easier

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
or Kelly so I just think he'll be easier

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010 
or Kelly so I just think he'll be easier
if<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> change<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.100> channel<00:00:53.489> name<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> be
