00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.200
 me 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.689

 the team never believes and why does not take his orders

 because they are not playable there are not given names on 23 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.379
 the prosecution did not appeal to the rest of the northern parliaments 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.519
 in cemeteries so badly 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.379

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.829
