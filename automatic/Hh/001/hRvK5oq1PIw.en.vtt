00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.629
 but you understand that most likely 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.520
 in the summer you need will already be 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.069
 some new challenge need to inflate new 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.980
 motivation I understood you but these are ours with how 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.320
 I will tell you now not to think about it 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
 there is no sense what will be in the summer because 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.109
 what you need to focus here 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.300
 exactly that fish 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 remember how you started this interview about 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 the fact that we communicate with journalists as 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.789
 with normal people and now let's go 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.369
 some kind of pattern and tiger pattern so 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 as it is as I thought you want to body I 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.060
 I think that now we have no riddles that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 in half a year I don't know tomorrow will be 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 between asks where the new year will be 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.770
 I will mark as I speak in that city 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.059
 so I answer those as I am now 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.700
 there will be a whole preparatory collection you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.440
 went to the gathering ruby ​​football player that's not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.420
 just went share there all thoughts 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 disappear well, that need to work and plow 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 and went all for if I think about no well 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.600
 I don’t know very well how 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.309
 train athletes train and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 at the same time negotiating that through 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 half a year let's get ready now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.000
 in six months I will leave, I really think that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 football player is with other athletes 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 in pages athletes compared to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.060
 skiers they are really a lot 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.810
 train two sheets you have one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 training a day but so this year 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 Heads of nothing I want you just to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 this answer is the hardest I think 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.890
 sang will support me with what the essence is up to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.680
 training 1 everyone thinks so but with me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 heavy footballer this is exactly hold back 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.200
 certain frameworks because 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 training yes indeed 1 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.210
 but the rest of the time you should 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.590
 prepare for the next workout if 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.479
 you just stupidly went to some there 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.380
 bluing or kurolesit nothing good 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.490
 just have to understand perfectly 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.470
 training is 2 but you need to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 keep constantly exactly 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.369
 so I try to come up with all the time 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.250
 all sorts of new normal ones 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 entertainment know not understood and splits 1 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.210
 ice skate well i mean active do not 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.740
 sda to tennis and being able 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.110
 tabletop tabletop big oh well 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.729
 back cross-country skiing Road Cafe 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.500
 Lesha 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.030
