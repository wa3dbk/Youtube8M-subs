00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.639 

now<00:00:05.029> we're<00:00:05.240> able<00:00:05.359> to<00:00:05.569> build<00:00:05.779> a<00:00:05.930> boat<00:00:06.109> that<00:00:06.589> is

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
now we're able to build a boat that is

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.799 
now we're able to build a boat that is
completely<00:00:07.160> frameless<00:00:07.790> one<00:00:08.270> that<00:00:08.450> doesn't

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
completely frameless one that doesn't

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.590 
completely frameless one that doesn't
require<00:00:09.080> a<00:00:09.200> frame<00:00:09.650> to<00:00:10.010> hold<00:00:10.280> it<00:00:10.639> together<00:00:10.789> we

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
require a frame to hold it together we

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.270 
require a frame to hold it together we
use<00:00:11.840> what's<00:00:12.080> called<00:00:12.170> an<00:00:12.589> I<00:00:12.740> beam<00:00:13.009> suspension

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
use what's called an I beam suspension

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.540 
use what's called an I beam suspension
in<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.030> seat<00:00:14.690> section<00:00:15.019> of<00:00:15.349> this<00:00:15.530> boat<00:00:15.799> which

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
in the seat section of this boat which

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.210 
in the seat section of this boat which
binds<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.360> boat<00:00:17.570> together<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:18.650> coupled

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
binds the boat together that coupled

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.640 
binds the boat together that coupled
with<00:00:19.250> our<00:00:19.520> unit<00:00:19.849> rack<00:00:20.090> design<00:00:20.660> we've<00:00:21.410> got<00:00:21.619> a

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
with our unit rack design we've got a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.830 
with our unit rack design we've got a
boat<00:00:21.949> that<00:00:22.160> is<00:00:22.310> super<00:00:22.550> lightweight<00:00:22.939> with<00:00:23.660> no

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
boat that is super lightweight with no

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.279 
boat that is super lightweight with no
frame<00:00:24.260> it<00:00:24.949> comes<00:00:25.250> in<00:00:25.460> at<00:00:25.970> literally<00:00:26.630> half<00:00:26.929> or

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
frame it comes in at literally half or

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.130 
frame it comes in at literally half or
even<00:00:27.320> less<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.400> weight<00:00:28.609> of<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.029> frame<00:00:29.300> boat<00:00:29.570> so

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
even less the weight of a frame boat so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.710 
even less the weight of a frame boat so
obviously<00:00:31.099> performance<00:00:32.000> has<00:00:32.150> been<00:00:32.300> enhanced

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
obviously performance has been enhanced

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.810 
obviously performance has been enhanced
greatly<00:00:33.350> we've<00:00:33.830> got<00:00:34.040> guys<00:00:34.220> using<00:00:34.519> these<00:00:34.760> for

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
greatly we've got guys using these for
