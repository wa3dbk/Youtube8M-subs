00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.160

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.480

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.530

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.450

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.130
 description in a notation that has already 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.480
 found the best weapon of white 2i os 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 he taught them and I say his 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.610
 characteristics more or less and good 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.010
 first this has been said by some 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.690
 youtubers already but good my duty is 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.520
 inform my subscribers and others to 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.060
 I do not know because you already know to see 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.129
 The first is to give you options here 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.319
 we give to install the game you see 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.620
 we are in a multiplayer we give to 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:41.979
 options install the game here install 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.269
 it takes a lot is two gigs and well this 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.949
 it is the first and the important good that 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.579
 to improve the game performance in 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.229
 yes in full and then we give to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.209
 play online and when we go to play 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.609
 game we give you to look for game and 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:56.769
 when we are here in the menu in the 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.030
 play is the square is not the team that 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.429
 button if I was putting it low to the right 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 we give the square and we get 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.879
 search preferences and here we can 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.800
 choose if we want you not to target 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.640
 any game that usually we 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.909
 put 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.150
 garbage starting with a fucking host 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.950
 and we have much xi ie after the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.330
 we have in normal is how it comes to us 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 predetermined that sometimes they do not get 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.740
 games with very bad games something that we 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.720
 the connection is very bad and sometimes it gets us 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.160
 in good games I always leave it 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 here is better once we put it on 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.119
 will be saved forever does not take 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.220
 more in search even I think it takes 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.200
 less in looking for a match, leave it here 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.320
 in better and that assures us to always have 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.860
 a good game with a good host and without 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.910
 the man is that you will ever have a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.770
 little long whatever it is but 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.660
 I usually have it that way 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.460
 perfect, I no longer hit the ties that 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.289
 they hit tennis and it does not go so much the games and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 others so I recommend you leave it 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.100
 here in better and you stay saved 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.539
 you can always go out and you can go 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.850
 It is to your liking forever so 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.649
 that you can forget and you'll see how it goes 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.330
 much better kids and nothing I hope that 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.979

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.179
