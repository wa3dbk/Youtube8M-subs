00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
go why that's something if I compare

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
go why that's something if I compare
that<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.970> p5<00:01:06.780> series<00:01:07.320> -<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.570> think<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.840> are

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that to my p5 series - I think they are

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
that to my p5 series - I think they are
like<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.119> maybe<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:12.750> done

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like the same and maybe I've done

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
like the same and maybe I've done
something<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> volume<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
something because I think the volume is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.260 
something because I think the volume is
little<00:01:15.119> higher<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> sound<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.310> little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little higher and the sound is little

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060 
little higher and the sound is little
different<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.049> can't<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.799> finger

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
different but I can't put my finger

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
different but I can't put my finger
right<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.270> done<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> will

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
right on what they have done but I will

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.380 
right on what they have done but I will
come<00:01:22.860> back<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.360> I
