00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.420 
shots right here at 20 yards you'll see
how<00:00:51.149> easy<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.430> amazing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
how easy it is and it's pretty amazing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
how easy it is and it's pretty amazing
how<00:00:53.579> accurate<00:00:53.969> without<00:00:54.690> even<00:00:55.289> practicing<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
how accurate without even practicing you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.340 
how accurate without even practicing you
can<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:57.239> by<00:00:57.390> looking<00:00:57.780> through<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> peep

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
can be just by looking through the peep

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
can be just by looking through the peep
and<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.640> you'll<00:00:59.820> notice<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.539> among

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and also you'll notice it what among

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.619 
and also you'll notice it what among
power<00:01:01.800> stroke<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.399> drawings<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.329> we

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
power stroke your drawings but what we

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.340 
power stroke your drawings but what we
have<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
have with this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.090 
have with this
now<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.620> course<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.100> takes<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.550> time<00:01:10.100> quickly

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
now of course it takes more time quickly

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.730 
now of course it takes more time quickly
so<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.660> won't<00:01:12.660> take<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.050> so<00:01:13.200> much<00:01:13.260> time

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so that won't take up so much time

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.110 
so that won't take up so much time
what's<00:01:14.670> up

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
what's up

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480 
what's up

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so person you draw the bow back one hand

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.600 
so person you draw the bow back one hand
just<00:01:17.850> fine<00:01:18.390> grab<00:01:18.660> hold<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.110> let<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just fine grab hold of let you know that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
just fine grab hold of let you know that
gold<00:01:20.850> latch<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.610> nice<00:01:24.420> amount<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> bow

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
little part right here where it actually

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.160 
little part right here where it actually
fits<00:02:01.630> over<00:02:02.630> my<00:02:03.400> might<00:02:04.400> wrap<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.869> open<00:02:06.080> my

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
fits over my might wrap it open my

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.490 
fits over my might wrap it open my
shoulder<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.979> gotta<00:02:07.250> kind<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.640> push<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.209> just
