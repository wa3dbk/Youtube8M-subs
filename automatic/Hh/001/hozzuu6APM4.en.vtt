community<00:00:56.210> 15<00:00:56.719> gallon<00:00:57.050> tank<00:00:58.989> alright<00:00:59.989> let's

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
community 15 gallon tank alright let's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.670 
community 15 gallon tank alright let's
see<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.829> works<00:01:02.140> first<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.410> will<00:01:03.559> have<00:01:03.770> to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
see how this works first we will have to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.469 
see how this works first we will have to
set<00:01:06.680> is<00:01:06.859> container<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.909> they've<00:01:08.060> had<00:01:08.240> them

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
set is container that they've had them

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.379 
set is container that they've had them
in<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.779> store<00:01:09.319> there<00:01:09.649> for<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:09.979> bit<00:01:10.189> leave<00:01:11.179> it<00:01:11.359> in

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:11.389 
in the store there for a bit leave it in

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:12.940 
in the store there for a bit leave it in
there<00:01:11.569> so<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.929> water<00:01:12.109> temperature<00:01:12.529> will<00:01:12.829> be

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
there so the water temperature will be

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.129 
there so the water temperature will be
able<00:01:13.069> to<00:01:13.399> change<00:01:13.969> too<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.630> his<00:01:17.869> water

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:18.139 
able to change too so his water

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.809 
able to change too so his water
temperature<00:01:18.649> will<00:01:18.740> change<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.159> same<00:01:19.369> as<00:01:19.520> tank

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
temperature will change the same as tank

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.559 
temperature will change the same as tank
do<00:01:20.539> that<00:01:20.749> for<00:01:20.899> about<00:01:20.990> half<00:01:21.259> an<00:01:21.409> hour<00:01:21.499> so<00:01:22.569> see
