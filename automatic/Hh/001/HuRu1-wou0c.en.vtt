00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
in a certain direction and then you can

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.980 
in a certain direction and then you can
use<00:01:06.160> her<00:01:06.250> E<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.790> also<00:01:07.210> since<00:01:07.479> he's<00:01:07.660> slowed

while she's an egg farm so the only way

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.330 
while she's an egg farm so the only way
you<00:01:19.450> can<00:01:19.750> do<00:01:19.899> this<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.619> use<00:01:20.860> your<00:01:20.890> teleport

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
you can do this is you use your teleport

to get out of there next is gonna be a
trucks<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.509> actually<00:01:40.630> skipped<00:01:40.990> eight

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
trucks and I actually skipped eight

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.590 
trucks and I actually skipped eight
trucks<00:01:41.410> because<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:42.039> knew<00:01:42.340> nothing<00:01:42.850> cool<00:01:43.210> about

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
trucks because I knew nothing cool about

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.690 
trucks because I knew nothing cool about
him<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.260> was<00:01:44.380> unique<00:01:44.680> or<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.950> trick<00:01:45.310> Nick<00:01:45.460> can

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
him that was unique or a trick Nick can

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.340 
him that was unique or a trick Nick can
do<00:01:45.909> except<00:01:46.570> where<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.869> cast<00:01:47.049> you<00:01:47.200> eat

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
do except where you can cast you eat

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.320 
do except where you can cast you eat
before<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.950> flash<00:01:48.159> although<00:01:48.610> really<00:01:48.850> useless

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
before the flash although really useless

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.149 
before the flash although really useless
in<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.600> real<00:01:49.810> game<00:01:50.080> since<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.650> travels<00:01:51.010> really

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
in a real game since it travels really

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.580 
in a real game since it travels really
slow<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:51.850> easy<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.180> react<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.630> technical

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
slow and it's easy to react to technical

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.740 
slow and it's easy to react to technical
to<00:01:53.740> know<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.189> I<00:01:54.549> guess<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:54.970> say<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.450> his

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
to know and I guess I can say that his

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.289 
to know and I guess I can say that his
passive<00:01:56.350> does<00:01:56.710> work<00:01:57.100> with<00:01:57.280> spirit<00:01:57.610> visage<00:01:57.729> the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
passive does work with spirit visage the

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.609 
passive does work with spirit visage the
next<00:01:58.540> trick<00:01:58.659> we're<00:01:58.810> gonna<00:01:58.960> be<00:01:59.140> showing<00:01:59.320> is

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
next trick we're gonna be showing is

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.679 
next trick we're gonna be showing is
with<00:01:59.860> his<00:02:00.009> ear<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.490> ever<00:02:01.119> since<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.509> patch

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
with his ear and ever since the patch

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.810 
with his ear and ever since the patch
we're<00:02:01.990> at<00:02:02.200> zero<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.740> use<00:02:02.950> his<00:02:03.189> Q<00:02:03.460> while<00:02:03.700> in

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
we're at zero can use his Q while in

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.179 
we're at zero can use his Q while in
midair<00:02:03.939> with<00:02:04.570> his<00:02:04.720> e<00:02:04.960> his<00:02:05.409> ear<00:02:05.650> Ange<00:02:05.860> actually

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
midair with his e his ear Ange actually

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.160 
midair with his e his ear Ange actually
got<00:02:06.340> an<00:02:06.460> increase<00:02:06.939> when<00:02:07.479> he<00:02:07.540> do<00:02:07.689> combine<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
got an increase when he do combine the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.749 
got an increase when he do combine the
two<00:02:08.320> spells<00:02:08.649> together<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.340> means<00:02:09.640> is

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
two spells together this means is

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.490 
two spells together this means is
actually<00:02:09.880> harder<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.420> gank<00:02:10.690> him<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:10.959> lane<00:02:11.200> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
actually harder to gank him in lane and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.590 
actually harder to gank him in lane and
also<00:02:12.010> opens<00:02:12.340> up<00:02:12.489> some<00:02:12.700> cool<00:02:12.940> wall<00:02:13.150> hops<00:02:13.360> with

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
also opens up some cool wall hops with

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180 
also opens up some cool wall hops with
him<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.320> I'll<00:02:14.440> be<00:02:14.560> showing<00:02:14.739> some<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.040> these

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
him and so I'll be showing some of these

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.830 
him and so I'll be showing some of these
wool<00:02:15.400> hops<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.910> guys<00:02:16.060> get<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.299> general<00:02:16.720> idea

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
wool hops so you guys get a general idea

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:28.509 
wool hops so you guys get a general idea
of<00:02:17.049> what<00:02:17.350> he<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.620> do

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.740 

all<00:02:29.519> right<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.000> next<00:02:30.030> trick<00:02:30.269> is<00:02:30.420> gonna<00:02:30.540> be

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
all right so the next trick is gonna be

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.030 
all right so the next trick is gonna be
one<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.319> tricks<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.650> did<00:02:31.799> in<00:02:31.950> an

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
one of the same tricks I did in an

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
one of the same tricks I did in an
earlier<00:02:32.489> video<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.659> had<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
earlier video but I actually had a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.229 
earlier video but I actually had a
misconception<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.950> basically<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
misconception and basically what I

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.180 
misconception and basically what I
thought<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> flash<00:02:37.500> behind<00:02:37.920> an

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
thought is you have to flash behind an

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.369 
thought is you have to flash behind an
enemy<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.239> wall<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> pushing<00:02:40.290> them

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
enemy to use your wall and pushing them

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.899 
enemy to use your wall and pushing them
to<00:02:40.530> your<00:02:40.680> teammates<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.430> what<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.760> can

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
to your teammates but what you can

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.789 
to your teammates but what you can
actually<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.629> just<00:02:42.930> use<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.260> AR<00:02:43.409> when<00:02:43.709> you

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
actually do is just use your AR when you

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.740 
actually do is just use your AR when you
bump<00:02:43.980> into<00:02:44.159> them<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.670> they'll<00:02:45.269> go<00:02:45.390> towards

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
bump into them and they'll go towards

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.360 
bump into them and they'll go towards
your<00:02:45.870> teammates<00:02:46.260> since<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:46.890> wall<00:02:47.159> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
your teammates since your wall is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.069 
your teammates since your wall is
actually<00:02:47.489> coming<00:02:47.819> behind<00:02:48.329> his<00:02:48.510> ear<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.049> it

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
actually coming behind his ear so it

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.229 
actually coming behind his ear so it
actually<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:49.650> push<00:02:49.890> them<00:02:50.099> without<00:02:50.400> flash<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
actually can push them without flash the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.520 
actually can push them without flash the
next<00:02:51.480> missed<00:02:51.659> trick<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.019> gonna<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
next missed trick is gonna be at the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.800 
next missed trick is gonna be at the
Caitlyn<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.579> one<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.849> miss<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.299> gonna<00:02:54.599> be

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
Caitlyn and the one we miss is gonna be

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.680 
Caitlyn and the one we miss is gonna be
Caitlyn<00:02:55.349> doing<00:02:55.890> Baron<00:02:56.250> around<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.940> wall<00:02:57.120> so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
Caitlyn doing Baron around the wall so

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.569 
Caitlyn doing Baron around the wall so
in<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.140> new<00:02:58.349> map<00:02:58.560> there's<00:02:59.099> actually<00:02:59.370> several

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
in this new map there's actually several

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.069 
in this new map there's actually several
places<00:02:59.849> where<00:03:00.030> Caitlyn<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.629> actually<00:03:00.930> hit

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
places where Caitlyn can actually hit

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.780 
places where Caitlyn can actually hit
there<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.319> now<00:03:01.560> since<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.310> Baron<00:03:02.670> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
there and now since I think Baron is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.030 
there and now since I think Baron is
bigger<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.420> as<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.810> see<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:04.379> Caitlyn<00:03:04.829> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
bigger so as you can see I'm Caitlyn and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.069 
bigger so as you can see I'm Caitlyn and
I<00:03:05.160> can<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.670> over<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:06.209> wall<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.720> hit

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
I can go all over this wall and hit

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.619 
I can go all over this wall and hit
Baron<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.069> other<00:03:08.220> side<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.269> old<00:03:09.450> map

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
Baron on the other side in the old map

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.210 
Baron on the other side in the old map
there's<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.049> one<00:03:10.349> sweet<00:03:10.650> spot<00:03:10.890> where<00:03:11.129> you

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
there's this one sweet spot where you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.309 
there's this one sweet spot where you
had<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.640> stand<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:12.269> luckily<00:03:12.629> in<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.989> new<00:03:13.140> map

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
had to stand but luckily in this new map

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.979 
had to stand but luckily in this new map
it<00:03:13.560> doesn't<00:03:13.829> take<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:13.980> much<00:03:14.569> pathing<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
it doesn't take that much pathing the

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.630 
it doesn't take that much pathing the
only<00:03:16.170> other<00:03:16.290> champion<00:03:16.799> who<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.099> do<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
only other champion who can do this is

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.160 
only other champion who can do this is
just<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.150> when<00:03:18.450> she's<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> certain<00:03:19.019> level

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
jinx with their Q and I think an e but

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.509 
jinx with their Q and I think an e but
I'm<00:03:22.379> not<00:03:22.530> 100%<00:03:22.890> sure

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
I'm not 100% sure

I'm not 100% sure
the<00:03:23.730> next<00:03:23.970> trick<00:03:24.060> we'll<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.329> showing<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.780> with

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the next trick we'll be showing is with

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.530 
the next trick we'll be showing is with
Dinah<00:03:25.379> so<00:03:26.310> some<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.819> guys<00:03:26.849> have<00:03:27.180> pointed

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
Dinah so some of you guys have pointed

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.150 
Dinah so some of you guys have pointed
out<00:03:27.659> that<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.109> swap<00:03:28.349> positions<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
out that you can swap positions with the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.430 
out that you can swap positions with the
enemy<00:03:29.609> by<00:03:29.940> using<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.329> E<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.810> R<00:03:30.989> at<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.230> same

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
enemy by using your E and R at the same

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.839 
enemy by using your E and R at the same
time<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.130> definitely<00:03:32.549> better<00:03:32.760> than

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
time this is definitely better than

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.460 
time this is definitely better than
using<00:03:33.209> your<00:03:33.359> E<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.810> then<00:03:33.930> waiting<00:03:34.230> onto<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
using your E and then waiting onto the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.140 
using your E and then waiting onto the
enemy<00:03:34.769> comes<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.489> then<00:03:35.579> using<00:03:35.819> your<00:03:35.849> R

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
enemy comes to you and then using your R

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.420 
enemy comes to you and then using your R
right<00:03:36.690> after<00:03:37.169> since<00:03:37.709> you're<00:03:37.829> only<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.220> front

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
right after since you're only in front

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.460 
right after since you're only in front
of<00:03:38.579> them<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.660> you're<00:03:39.780> behind<00:03:40.139> them<00:03:40.290> that

of them and if you're behind them that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.289 
of them and if you're behind them that
we<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.739> get<00:03:40.889> more<00:03:41.069> Auto<00:03:41.250> attacks<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.790> of

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
we can get more Auto attacks in of

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.729 
we can get more Auto attacks in of
course<00:03:42.599> not<00:03:42.780> always<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.200> want<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.590> this

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.879 
because you might want to hold on to
your<00:03:45.450> arm<00:03:45.480> maybe<00:03:45.840> because<00:03:46.260> your<00:03:46.379> Q<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.769> coming

with some auto text then go for it the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.869 
with some auto text then go for it the
next<00:03:52.799> Miss<00:03:53.010> trick<00:03:53.220> we're<00:03:53.340> gonna<00:03:53.489> be<00:03:53.609> showing

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
next Miss trick we're gonna be showing

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.300 
next Miss trick we're gonna be showing
is<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.180> ezio<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.139> as<00:03:55.379> really<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.190> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
is with ezio so as really is one of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
is with ezio so as really is one of
those<00:03:56.370> unique<00:03:56.639> abilities<00:03:57.150> where<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.540> can't<00:03:57.750> be

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
those unique abilities where it can't be

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.199 
those unique abilities where it can't be
interrupted<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.010> basically<00:03:59.400> if<00:03:59.699> there's

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
interrupted and so basically if there's

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.300 
interrupted and so basically if there's
a<00:04:00.299> displacement<00:04:00.780> skill<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.739> casted<00:04:02.190> on

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
a displacement skill that is casted on

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.159 
a displacement skill that is casted on
you<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> casting<00:04:03.720> well<00:04:03.870> spells

trying<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.530> displace<00:04:04.859> you<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.579> e<00:04:05.609> will<00:04:05.940> always

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
trying to displace you the e will always

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.240 
trying to displace you the e will always
let<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.359> escape<00:04:06.569> from<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.199> spell<00:04:07.560> since<00:04:08.129> it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
let you escape from that spell since it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.490 
let you escape from that spell since it
is<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> teleport<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.090> not<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.299> -<00:04:09.569> this<00:04:10.139> is<00:04:10.290> also

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
is a teleport and not a - this is also

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.140 
is a teleport and not a - this is also
what<00:04:10.799> makes<00:04:10.949> a<00:04:11.129> zero<00:04:11.340> more<00:04:11.519> slippery<00:04:11.849> than

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
what makes a zero more slippery than

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.000 
what makes a zero more slippery than
utter<00:04:12.329> ad<00:04:12.540> carry's<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.260> hence<00:04:13.560> why<00:04:13.799> he's

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
carries there is the next wreck we're

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.490 
carries there is the next wreck we're
gonna<00:04:17.459> be<00:04:17.609> showing<00:04:17.849> is<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.389> a<00:04:18.570> zeros<00:04:18.810> W<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.349> E

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
gonna be showing is with a zeros W and E

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.680 
gonna be showing is with a zeros W and E
basically<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.340> can<00:04:20.489> shoot<00:04:20.669> your<00:04:20.820> W<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> an<00:04:21.510> E

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
basically you can shoot your W and an E

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.570 
basically you can shoot your W and an E
into<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> get<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.440> buff<00:04:22.650> which<00:04:23.250> gives<00:04:23.490> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
into it to get the buff which gives you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.520 
into it to get the buff which gives you
a<00:04:23.610> TAC<00:04:23.820> speed<00:04:24.090> it's<00:04:24.510> kind<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.870> useless<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.320> most

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
a TAC speed it's kind of useless in most

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.379 
a TAC speed it's kind of useless in most
scenarios<00:04:25.740> since<00:04:26.550> you'll<00:04:26.760> probably<00:04:27.000> use<00:04:27.150> your

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
scenarios since you'll probably use your

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.180 
scenarios since you'll probably use your
W<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.810> shoot<00:04:28.020> at<00:04:28.139> someone<00:04:28.410> rather<00:04:28.919> than

W to shoot at someone rather than

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
enemy and then right up to him the next

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.200 
enemy and then right up to him the next
trick<00:04:57.069> we're<00:04:57.280> gonna<00:04:57.370> be<00:04:57.490> showing<00:04:57.849> is<00:04:58.030> with

trick we're gonna be showing is with

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.999 
trick we're gonna be showing is with
hecarim<00:04:58.509> so<00:04:59.080> basically<00:04:59.440> when<00:04:59.770> you're<00:04:59.889> using

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
hecarim so basically when you're using

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.409 
hecarim so basically when you're using
your<00:05:00.099> ultimate<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.729> you're<00:05:00.879> about<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.090> land

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
your ultimate and you're about to land

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.719 
your ultimate and you're about to land
you<00:05:01.659> can<00:05:01.780> actually<00:05:01.930> flash<00:05:02.349> to<00:05:02.919> get<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.159> CC<00:05:03.550> in

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
you can actually flash to get the CC in

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.339 
you can actually flash to get the CC in
a<00:05:03.819> different<00:05:04.150> area<00:05:04.270> along<00:05:04.750> with<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> impact

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
a different area along with the impact

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.260 
a different area along with the impact
damage<00:05:05.530> this<00:05:06.099> would<00:05:06.280> be<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.970> would<00:05:07.120> actually

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
damage this would be this would actually

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.930 
damage this would be this would actually
be<00:05:07.449> a<00:05:07.539> useful<00:05:07.720> trick<00:05:08.289> if<00:05:08.470> hecarim<00:05:08.940> actually

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
be a useful trick if hecarim actually

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.879 
be a useful trick if hecarim actually
used<00:05:10.090> flash<00:05:10.360> but<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.960> know<00:05:11.080> most<00:05:11.319> harems<00:05:11.740> will

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
used flash but you know most harems will

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.339 
used flash but you know most harems will
run<00:05:12.099> ghost<00:05:12.400> for<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.210> bonus<00:05:13.509> damage<00:05:13.659> and<00:05:14.110> of

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
run ghost for the bonus damage and of

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.230 
run ghost for the bonus damage and of
course<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.800> chasing<00:05:15.130> people<00:05:15.220> down<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:16.150> if

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
course just chasing people down but if

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.450 
course just chasing people down but if
you<00:05:16.360> do<00:05:16.509> run<00:05:16.750> flash<00:05:16.960> then<00:05:17.289> definitely<00:05:17.530> be

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
you do run flash then definitely be

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.100 
you do run flash then definitely be
aware<00:05:18.699> of<00:05:18.819> this<00:05:18.940> trick<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.990> can

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
surprise enemies by flashing on to them

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.879 
surprise enemies by flashing on to them
and<00:05:21.880> then<00:05:22.150> seeing<00:05:22.840> them<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.440> net<00:05:23.620> recovery

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
and then seeing them the net recovery

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.589 
and then seeing them the net recovery
showing<00:05:24.280> which<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.639> also<00:05:24.940> shown<00:05:25.180> in<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.419> last

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
showing which is also shown in a last

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.450 
showing which is also shown in a last
clip<00:05:25.840> too<00:05:26.050> is<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:26.620> basically<00:05:27.069> every<00:05:27.430> time

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
clip too is that basically every time

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.980 
clip too is that basically every time

you use your ultimate you want to put it

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.839 
you use your ultimate you want to put it
behind<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.530> enemy<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.550> enemies

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
behind the enemy so that the enemies

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.309 
behind the enemy so that the enemies
feared<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.389> starts<00:05:31.599> running<00:05:31.780> towards<00:05:32.199> your
