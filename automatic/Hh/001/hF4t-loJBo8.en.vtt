00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
out from the left and right top and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660 
out from the left and right top and
bottom<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> gotta<00:00:50.280> start<00:00:50.430> paying

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
bottom so you gotta start paying

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
bottom so you gotta start paying
attention<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.629> tell<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:51.870> away

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
attention I'm gonna tell you right away

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
attention I'm gonna tell you right away
it's<00:00:52.440> very<00:00:52.500> hard<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> zombies<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's very hard to see the zombies you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's very hard to see the zombies you
know<00:00:54.840> either<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.520> type

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
know either they need to be a some type

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
know either they need to be a some type
of<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> different<00:00:57.030> color<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.140> much<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
of a different color not so much the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
of a different color not so much the
background<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.010> sure<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.340> part<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
background I'm sure that's part of the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.670 
background I'm sure that's part of the
way<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.600> makes<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> game<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.410> difficult

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
way that makes the game more difficult

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
way that makes the game more difficult
but<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> top<00:01:02.520> bridge<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.059> see<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
but on the top bridge you can see the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.340 
but on the top bridge you can see the
zombie<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> right

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
zombie on the right

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.800 
zombie on the right
I<00:01:04.379> can't<00:01:04.979> barely<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.549> him<00:01:05.670> may<00:01:05.880> need<00:01:06.119> eagle

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I can't barely see him may need eagle

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.410 
I can't barely see him may need eagle
eyes<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.400> that's<00:01:08.549> part<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
eyes to see that so that's part of a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270 
eyes to see that so that's part of a
problem<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.049> game<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.830> makes<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

it at a 90 degree angle on the far right

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.630 
it at a 90 degree angle on the far right
so<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.770> depends<00:03:12.040> how<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.489> hold
