Matier home survival ideas and I got my

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
Matier home survival ideas and I got my
Fresnel<00:00:13.049> lens<00:00:13.410> out<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.719> I<00:00:15.719> am<00:00:15.839> testing<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.740> see

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
Fresnel lens out and I am testing to see

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.849 
Fresnel lens out and I am testing to see
if<00:00:17.279> it'll<00:00:18.240> boil<00:00:18.480> water<00:00:21.230> it's<00:00:22.230> been<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.650> for

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
if it'll boil water it's been on for

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.920 
if it'll boil water it's been on for
literally<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:24.060> minutes<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> probably<00:00:24.750> should

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
literally two minutes I probably should

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
literally two minutes I probably should
have<00:00:25.050> filmed<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> whole<00:00:25.500> thing<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:26.550> just

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
have filmed the whole thing but I'm just

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
have filmed the whole thing but I'm just
gonna<00:00:26.789> post<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> quick<00:00:27.390> video<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
gonna post a quick video it is

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.930 
gonna post a quick video it is
definitely<00:00:29.179> bubbling<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> water<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:30.810> boiling

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
definitely bubbling the water or boiling

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.470 
definitely bubbling the water or boiling
it<00:00:32.940> doesn't<00:00:33.270> burn<00:00:33.390> through<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:35.820> don't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it doesn't burn through the can I don't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
it doesn't burn through the can I don't
have<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> set<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.140> its<00:00:37.410> highest<00:00:37.770> focal<00:00:38.309> point

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
have it set on its highest focal point

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.389 
have it set on its highest focal point
which<00:00:38.969> means<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.260> getting<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.829> bulk<00:00:41.250> of

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
which means it's not getting the bulk of

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
which means it's not getting the bulk of
the<00:00:41.550> heat<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:43.520> as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.700> guys<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.230> it<00:00:46.230> will

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the heat and as you guys can see it will

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.520 
the heat and as you guys can see it will
boil<00:00:46.710> water<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.270> had<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> pan<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
boil water so if you had like a pan you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.869 
boil water so if you had like a pan you
could<00:00:49.680> put<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> black<00:00:50.340> rock<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
could put like a black rock at the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.319 
could put like a black rock at the
bottom<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> pan<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.489> I<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.850> no<00:00:54.030> doubt

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
bottom of the pan and I have no doubt

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.680 
bottom of the pan and I have no doubt
it'll<00:00:54.600> boil<00:00:54.780> gallons<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> water<00:00:56.539> which<00:00:57.539> would

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it'll boil gallons of water which would

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
it'll boil gallons of water which would
work<00:00:58.140> great<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.390> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
work great for you know if you had a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.799 
work great for you know if you had a
spot<00:01:01.410> where<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.680> were<00:01:02.090> camping<00:01:03.090> plus<00:01:03.629> there's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
spot where you were camping plus there's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.820 
spot where you were camping plus there's
no<00:01:03.870> smoke<00:01:04.700> like<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> campfire<00:01:06.119> would<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.830> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
no smoke like a campfire would be so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.090 
no smoke like a campfire would be so
anyway<00:01:08.729> let's<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.409> rapidly<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.920> thing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
anyway let's see how rapidly this thing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.359 
anyway let's see how rapidly this thing
gets<00:01:11.280> boiling<00:01:12.439> that's<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.740> already<00:01:14.010> pretty

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
gets boiling that's going already pretty

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.890 
gets boiling that's going already pretty
good<00:01:17.030> I'm<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.240> hoping<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> doesn't<00:01:18.600> turn

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
good I'm just hoping it doesn't turn

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
good I'm just hoping it doesn't turn
into<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.200> geyser<00:01:19.530> okay<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.460> I'd<00:01:20.700> say<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
into a geyser okay so I'd say that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.710 
into a geyser okay so I'd say that
suckers<00:01:21.450> boiling

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.360
