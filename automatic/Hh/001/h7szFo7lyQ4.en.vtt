light<00:00:59.080> so<00:00:59.290> we<00:00:59.320> could<00:00:59.559> have<00:00:59.650> explored<00:00:59.949> more<00:01:00.250> of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
light so we could have explored more of

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.189 
light so we could have explored more of
that<00:01:00.519> in<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.879> next<00:01:01.030> season<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.600> heard<00:01:02.019> there

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
that in the next season I heard there

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.020 
that in the next season I heard there
was<00:01:02.320> actually<00:01:02.619> good<00:01:02.769> if<00:01:02.949> they<00:01:03.100> had<00:01:03.309> no<00:01:03.549> seiza<00:01:03.909> I

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
was actually good if they had no seiza I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.580 
was actually good if they had no seiza I
heard<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.299> going<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.510> be<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.600> time<00:01:04.869> skip<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:05.530> I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
heard is going to be a time skip so I

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.630 
heard is going to be a time skip so I
don't<00:01:05.770> know<00:01:05.860> how<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.010> would<00:01:06.250> have<00:01:06.490> worked

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
don't know how that would have worked

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.840 
don't know how that would have worked
with<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.330> whole<00:01:07.479> Dark<00:01:07.720> Side<00:01:07.930> Story<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.700> could

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
with the whole Dark Side Story it could

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.429 
with the whole Dark Side Story it could
have<00:01:09.940> been<00:01:10.030> interesting<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.659> definitely<00:01:11.170> trust

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
have been interesting I definitely trust

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.980 
have been interesting I definitely trust
greg<00:01:11.799> weisman<00:01:12.070> if<00:01:12.340> he<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:13.000> gonna<00:01:13.149> do<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.600> season

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
greg weisman if he was gonna do a season

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.899 
greg weisman if he was gonna do a season
3<00:01:14.170> how<00:01:14.469> that<00:01:14.649> time<00:01:14.829> skip<00:01:15.189> would<00:01:15.490> affect

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
3 how that time skip would affect

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.279 
3 how that time skip would affect
everybody<00:01:16.180> um<00:01:17.820> yeah<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.240> think<00:01:19.719> in<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.229> end

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
everybody um yeah but I think in the end

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.529 
everybody um yeah but I think in the end
of<00:01:20.469> this<00:01:20.560> episode<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:21.189> mean<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:22.210> end<00:01:22.329> of<00:01:22.420> this

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
of this episode I mean the end of this

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.080 
of this episode I mean the end of this
episode<00:01:22.719> and<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.829> guess<00:01:24.189> of<00:01:24.369> gang<00:01:24.549> of<00:01:24.670> season<00:01:24.939> 3

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
episode and I guess of gang of season 3

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.940 
episode and I guess of gang of season 3
if<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.329> did<00:01:25.450> happen<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:26.259> definitely<00:01:26.469> would<00:01:26.770> get

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
if it did happen we definitely would get

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.499 
if it did happen we definitely would get
more<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.369> light<00:01:27.549> I<00:01:27.789> think<00:01:28.030> they've<00:01:28.299> been<00:01:28.479> a

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
more of the light I think they've been a

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.940 
more of the light I think they've been a
problem<00:01:28.810> since<00:01:29.170> these<00:01:29.380> are<00:01:29.439> one<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:29.829> they

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
problem since these are one and they

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.440 
problem since these are one and they
would<00:01:30.219> be<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.490> big<00:01:30.670> villains<00:01:31.000> made<00:01:31.270> there

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
would be the big villains made there

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.179 
would be the big villains made there
will<00:01:31.630> be<00:01:31.780> another<00:01:31.990> villain<00:01:32.350> here<00:01:32.859> and<00:01:33.009> there

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
will be another villain here and there

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.090 
will be another villain here and there
but<00:01:33.460> um<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.380> definitely<00:01:35.380> think<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.890> lights

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
but um I definitely think the lights

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.620 
but um I definitely think the lights
would<00:01:36.609> would<00:01:37.030> have<00:01:37.119> been<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.359> big<00:01:37.479> villain

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
would would have been the big villain

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.139 
would would have been the big villain
for<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.020> whole<00:01:38.140> series<00:01:38.560> if<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.670> did<00:01:39.850> continue

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
for the whole series if it did continue

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.450 
for the whole series if it did continue
um<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:41.380> think<00:01:41.469> they're<00:01:41.859> probably<00:01:41.979> be<00:01:42.280> another

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
um I think they're probably be another

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.609 
um I think they're probably be another
story<00:01:42.789> like<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.299> reach<00:01:43.479> I'm<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:44.229> kind<00:01:44.530> of

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
story like the reach I'm like kind of

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.349 
story like the reach I'm like kind of
that<00:01:44.770> sub<00:01:45.100> sorry<00:01:45.490> we<00:01:45.700> have<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> mole<00:01:46.179> in<00:01:46.299> the

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
that sub sorry we have a mole in the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.139 
that sub sorry we have a mole in the
beginning<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.960> then<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.499> had<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.679> reach<00:01:48.039> um<00:01:48.369> I

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
beginning and then we had the reach um I

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.380 
beginning and then we had the reach um I
do<00:01:49.420> think<00:01:50.049> well<00:01:50.740> maybe<00:01:50.770> they<00:01:51.280> plant<00:01:51.850> season<00:01:52.240> 3

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
do think well maybe they plant season 3

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.120 
do think well maybe they plant season 3
to<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.600> their<00:01:52.749> final<00:01:53.049> season<00:01:53.679> they<00:01:53.799> might<00:01:54.009> have

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
to be their final season they might have

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.709 
to be their final season they might have
just<00:01:54.280> concentrate<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.179> light<00:01:55.359> and<00:01:55.390> say

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
just concentrate on the light and say

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.899 
just concentrate on the light and say
that's<00:01:55.929> their<00:01:56.200> big<00:01:56.380> villain<00:01:56.740> because<00:01:57.399> that's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
that's their big villain because that's

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.700 
that's their big villain because that's
definitely<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.329> story<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.869> still<00:01:59.289> has<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.560> be

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
definitely a story that still has to be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.700 
definitely a story that still has to be
concentrated<00:02:00.130> on<00:02:00.899> Lex<00:02:01.899> being<00:02:02.109> president<00:02:02.469> I

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
concentrated on Lex being president I

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.590 
concentrated on Lex being president I
think<00:02:02.770> would<00:02:03.069> be<00:02:03.219> a<00:02:03.249> big<00:02:03.490> impact<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.389> show

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
think would be a big impact on the show

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.709 
think would be a big impact on the show
and<00:02:04.929> seeing<00:02:05.799> either<00:02:06.009> him<00:02:06.369> try<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.880> run<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
and seeing either him try to run for the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.020 
and seeing either him try to run for the
election<00:02:08.229> or<00:02:08.440> him<00:02:09.069> become<00:02:09.460> president<00:02:09.940> how

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
election or him become president how

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.390 
election or him become president how
that<00:02:10.270> affected<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.750> world<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.380> think<00:02:12.250> that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that affected the world I think that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.860 
that affected the world I think that
could<00:02:12.490> have<00:02:12.610> been<00:02:12.670> interesting<00:02:13.450> i<00:02:13.540> think<00:02:13.569> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
could have been interesting i think the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630 
could have been interesting i think the
team<00:02:14.080> would<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.260> grown<00:02:14.500> also<00:02:15.100> long<00:02:15.459> it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
team would have grown also long it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.509 
team would have grown also long it
always<00:02:15.940> does<00:02:16.209> um<00:02:16.720> or<00:02:17.319> people<00:02:17.530> would<00:02:18.220> have<00:02:18.340> left

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
always does um or people would have left

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.180 
always does um or people would have left
because<00:02:18.879> i<00:02:18.909> feel<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> lot<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.510> people<00:02:19.629> didn't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
because i feel a lot of people didn't

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
because i feel a lot of people didn't
the<00:02:20.550> team<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.090> they're<00:02:21.630> definitely

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the team I think they're definitely

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.140 
the team I think they're definitely
would<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.470> reasons<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.190> people<00:02:23.280> only<00:02:23.520> team<00:02:23.940> i

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
would be reasons for people only team i

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.510 
would be reasons for people only team i
think<00:02:24.390> i<00:02:24.570> was<00:02:25.080> season<00:02:25.380> 2<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.800> happen<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
think i was season 2 that happen and I

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.100 
think i was season 2 that happen and I
think<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.850> season<00:02:27.030> three<00:02:27.330> people<00:02:27.930> are<00:02:27.990> going

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
think what season three people are going

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.080 
think what season three people are going
to<00:02:28.200> leave<00:02:28.290> team<00:02:28.560> also<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.190> then<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> more

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
to leave team also but then and more

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.460 
to leave team also but then and more
people<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:30.690> definitely<00:02:30.990> Stephanie

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
people I think definitely Stephanie

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.990 
people I think definitely Stephanie
Brown<00:02:31.650> could<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.010> been<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> person<00:02:32.610> because

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
Brown could have been a person because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.350 
Brown could have been a person because
she<00:02:33.030> was<00:02:33.510> introduced<00:02:34.110> um<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:36.390> UM<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> show

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
she was introduced um to UM to the show

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.410 
she was introduced um to UM to the show
as<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.410> cameo<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.940> she<00:02:42.180> could<00:02:42.330> have

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
as a cameo so I think she could have

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870 
as a cameo so I think she could have
definitely<00:02:42.570> been<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.930> person<00:02:43.170> um<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.400> also<00:02:44.610> think

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
definitely been a person um I also think

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.610 
definitely been a person um I also think
we<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.810> could<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.080> bought<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> lot<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
we we could have bought a lot of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.020 
we we could have bought a lot of
flashbacks<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> could<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:47.910> been<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
flashbacks I think it could have been a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.480 
flashbacks I think it could have been a
really<00:02:48.270> good<00:02:48.510> flashback<00:02:49.020> season<00:02:49.410> um<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.370> know

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
really good flashback season um you know

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
how did Aquagirl die you know how did

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.770 
how did Aquagirl die you know how did

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
Tula how did Jason Todd die I think

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.700 
Tula how did Jason Todd die I think
those<00:02:57.900> who<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.110> could<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.560> those

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
those who it could be like those

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.290 
those who it could be like those
unanswered<00:02:59.070> questions<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.880> could<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.150> gone

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
unanswered questions we could have gone

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.510 
unanswered questions we could have gone
a<00:03:00.330> lot<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:01.050> having<00:03:01.470> mal<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> Bumblebee

a lot of I'm having mal and Bumblebee

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.100 
a lot of I'm having mal and Bumblebee
turn<00:03:02.850> into<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.270> those<00:03:03.660> high<00:03:03.840> school

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
turn into that those high school

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.750 
turn into that those high school
students<00:03:04.530> into<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.010> superheroes<00:03:05.490> they<00:03:05.610> are

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
students into the superheroes they are

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.730 
students into the superheroes they are
now<00:03:05.970> did<00:03:06.330> they<00:03:06.420> find<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.930> Superboy<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
now did they find out that Superboy and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.580 
now did they find out that Superboy and
Miss<00:03:07.860> Martian<00:03:08.640> were<00:03:09.360> superheroes<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.170> think

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
Miss Martian were superheroes I think

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.200 
Miss Martian were superheroes I think
that<00:03:10.830> could<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.340> been<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.460> interesting

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
that could have been really interesting

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.490 
that could have been really interesting
story<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.780> maybe<00:03:12.960> we<00:03:13.110> could<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.350> got<00:03:13.470> a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
story that maybe we could have got a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
story that maybe we could have got a
flashback<00:03:14.070> season<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.330> course<00:03:15.570> be

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
flashback season and but of course be

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.980 
flashback season and but of course be
primary<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.550> light<00:03:17.760> situation<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:18.960> I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
primary to on the light situation but I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.060 
primary to on the light situation but I
think<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.290> could<00:03:19.380> have<00:03:19.500> been<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.620> really<00:03:19.890> good

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
think it could have been a really good

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.880 
think it could have been a really good
season<00:03:20.130> if<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:21.170> tied<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.200> all<00:03:22.410> together<00:03:22.560> with

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
season if they tied it all together with

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.970 
season if they tied it all together with
flashbacks<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:23.790> present<00:03:24.690> time<00:03:24.870> or<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.680> don't

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
flashbacks and present time or I don't

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.170 
flashbacks and present time or I don't
think<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:26.220> should<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.400> done<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.670> time<00:03:26.820> skip

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
think they should have done on time skip

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.000 
think they should have done on time skip
for<00:03:27.450> next<00:03:27.690> season<00:03:27.959> if<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.170> did<00:03:28.380> have<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
for next season if they did have you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.890 
for next season if they did have you
know<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.340> next<00:03:29.700> season<00:03:29.820> but<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.540> think<00:03:30.780> it'd<00:03:30.870> be

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
know a next season but I think it'd be

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.930 
know a next season but I think it'd be
really<00:03:31.020> cool<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.770> we<00:03:31.950> didn't<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.610> somehow

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
really cool that we didn't like somehow

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.030 
really cool that we didn't like somehow
connected<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.260> main<00:03:34.410> story<00:03:34.709> these

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
connected to the main story these

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
connected to the main story these
flashbacks<00:03:35.340> but<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.480> could<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.660> been

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
flashbacks but that could have been

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.190 
flashbacks but that could have been
really<00:03:36.840> cool<00:03:37.200> um<00:03:38.510> honestly<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.690> feel<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:39.959> if

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
really cool um honestly I feel like if

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.870 
really cool um honestly I feel like if
flash<00:03:40.440> would<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.800> alive<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.640> really

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
flash would be alive I think that really

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.699 
flash would be alive I think that really
was<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.570> cliffhanger<00:03:42.810> for<00:03:43.230> Cesar<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
was just a cliffhanger for Cesar to I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.250 
was just a cliffhanger for Cesar to I
mean<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.790> now<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.540> cat<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.989> Kid

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260

Flash is dead you know that stuff way
that<00:03:48.930> happened<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.500> think<00:03:49.980> if<00:03:50.070> his<00:03:50.130> season<00:03:50.310> 3

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
that happened I think if his season 3

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.729 
that happened I think if his season 3
did<00:03:50.850> happen<00:03:51.030> i<00:03:51.269> feel<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.690> he<00:03:51.930> wouldn't<00:03:52.560> have

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
did happen i feel like he wouldn't have

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.800 
did happen i feel like he wouldn't have
died<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.550> i<00:03:53.610> feel<00:03:53.820> like<00:03:53.970> somehow<00:03:54.300> he<00:03:54.540> could

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
died and i feel like somehow he could

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.440 
died and i feel like somehow he could
have<00:03:54.900> came<00:03:55.050> back<00:03:55.290> um<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:56.760> had<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.239> gut

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
have came back um I just had a gut

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.720 
have came back um I just had a gut
feeling<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.810> wasn't<00:03:58.290> his<00:03:58.410> end<00:03:58.650> its<00:03:58.980> away<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
feeling that wasn't his end its away the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.120 
feeling that wasn't his end its away the
way<00:03:59.850> he<00:04:00.060> went<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.690> felt<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.920> just

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
way he went I just felt like I I just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
way he went I just felt like I I just
feel<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.370> he's<00:04:02.550> not<00:04:02.730> dead<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.360> obviously

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
feel like he's not dead but obviously

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.170 
feel like he's not dead but obviously
again<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.980> season<00:04:05.310> 2<00:04:05.430> ended<00:04:05.580> he's

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
again with the season 2 ended he's

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.940 
again with the season 2 ended he's
definitely<00:04:06.750> dead<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.110> if<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.230> had<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.410> season<00:04:07.769> 3

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
definitely dead but if we had a season 3

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.680 
definitely dead but if we had a season 3
feel<00:04:08.459> like<00:04:08.580> they<00:04:08.670> would<00:04:08.790> have<00:04:08.910> explored<00:04:09.420> that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
feel like they would have explored that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.100 
feel like they would have explored that
a<00:04:09.750> little<00:04:10.019> bit<00:04:10.110> more<00:04:10.320> um<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:11.640> think<00:04:12.570> Superboy

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
a little bit more um I think Superboy

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.240 
a little bit more um I think Superboy
Miss<00:04:13.380> Martian<00:04:13.769> would<00:04:13.890> have<00:04:13.980> been<00:04:14.070> together

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
Miss Martian would have been together

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
Miss Martian would have been together
they're<00:04:14.820> obviously<00:04:15.209> be<00:04:15.570> more<00:04:15.780> couples<00:04:16.169> I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
they're obviously be more couples I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.949 
they're obviously be more couples I
think<00:04:17.070> Nightwing<00:04:17.459> woulda<00:04:18.330> join<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> team

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
think Nightwing woulda join the team

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.960 
think Nightwing woulda join the team
again<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.709> he<00:04:19.830> would<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.400> think<00:04:20.880> he

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
again I think he would have I think he

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.030 
again I think he would have I think he
just<00:04:21.000> needed<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.720> break<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.440> woulda<00:04:22.830> saw

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
just needed a break and we woulda saw

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.450 
just needed a break and we woulda saw
him<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:23.750> his<00:04:24.750> normal<00:04:25.140> life<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.650> seeing<00:04:26.100> like

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
him in his normal life and seeing like

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.250 
him in his normal life and seeing like
all<00:04:26.700> right<00:04:26.820> well<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:27.360> I'm<00:04:27.419> Dick<00:04:27.660> Grayson<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
all right well now I'm Dick Grayson and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.200 
all right well now I'm Dick Grayson and
I<00:04:28.710> guess<00:04:28.919> we'll<00:04:29.130> see<00:04:29.280> him<00:04:29.400> still<00:04:29.669> as<00:04:29.820> dying<00:04:30.030> way

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
I guess we'll see him still as dying way

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.450 
I guess we'll see him still as dying way
helping<00:04:30.539> Batman<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.260> think<00:04:31.860> he<00:04:31.950> just<00:04:32.130> wanted<00:04:32.370> a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
helping Batman I think he just wanted a

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.519 
helping Batman I think he just wanted a
break<00:04:32.610> from<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.940> team<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.810> think<00:04:34.020> we

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:34.529 
break from the team so I think we

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:35.899 
break from the team so I think we
again<00:04:34.769> we<00:04:34.919> would<00:04:35.069> soar<00:04:35.339> him<00:04:35.489> more<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.759> his

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
again we would soar him more of his

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.309 
again we would soar him more of his
normal<00:04:36.239> life<00:04:36.359> and<00:04:36.659> I<00:04:36.719> think<00:04:36.929> we<00:04:37.049> would<00:04:37.259> have

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
normal life and I think we would have

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.369 
normal life and I think we would have
soared<00:04:37.589> more<00:04:37.829> grieving<00:04:38.309> with<00:04:38.669> flash<00:04:38.969> um<00:04:39.379> well

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
soared more grieving with flash um well

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.249 
soared more grieving with flash um well
kid<00:04:40.649> flash<00:04:40.859> with<00:04:41.099> um<00:04:41.339> Wally<00:04:42.259> especially

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
kid flash with um Wally especially

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.749 
kid flash with um Wally especially
through<00:04:43.709> date<00:04:43.919> because<00:04:44.039> I<00:04:44.189> feel<00:04:44.339> like<00:04:44.459> he

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
through date because I feel like he

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.319 
through date because I feel like he
needed<00:04:44.999> to<00:04:45.419> um<00:04:45.839> kind<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:47.639> morn<00:04:47.879> and<00:04:48.089> I<00:04:48.269> think

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:48.329 
needed to um kind of morn and I think

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:51.769 
needed to um kind of morn and I think
that's<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.719> he<00:04:48.809> did<00:04:48.959> lead<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.289> team<00:04:49.469> um<00:04:50.779> also

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:51.779 
that's what he did lead the team um also

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.719 
that's what he did lead the team um also

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
I think we maybe would have been able to

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.669 
I think we maybe would have been able to
see<00:04:56.549> more<00:04:56.849> regular<00:04:57.209> room<00:04:57.359> or<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.719> runaways<00:04:58.349> if

see more regular room or the runaways if

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.289 
see more regular room or the runaways if
season<00:04:59.039> three<00:04:59.219> did<00:04:59.399> happen<00:04:59.579> because<00:05:00.119> they

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:00.299 
season three did happen because they

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.839 
season three did happen because they
really<00:05:00.539> wrapped<00:05:00.749> up<00:05:00.959> that<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.529> that<00:05:02.459> those

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
really wrapped up that on that those

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.669 
really wrapped up that on that those
plots<00:05:03.149> and<00:05:03.449> sees<00:05:03.629> it<00:05:03.809> too<00:05:03.959> even<00:05:04.109> though<00:05:04.349> i<00:05:04.379> feel

i<00:05:04.859> feel<00:05:04.949> like<00:05:05.249> they<00:05:05.369> had<00:05:05.489> more<00:05:05.699> story<00:05:05.999> but

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
i feel like they had more story but

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.239
