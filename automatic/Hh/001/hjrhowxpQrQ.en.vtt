00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello friends here this beast 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.130
 future breath 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.980
 it we have here electrical shield I 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.249
 I suspect that someone will be interested 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.869
 how the electrical panel looks like water 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.519
 fuse automatons in such bounce 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.300
 when 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.220
 it means you can then return it to its place 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.319
 a bunch of wires 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.359
 after all it is signed on yellow 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:39.079
 signed where what goes here and no question 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:44.289
 that was what our new mouth went through 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:48.440
 1 small door 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:53.960
 started putting here we have a door here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 so here's the door the doors are empty a 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.109
 are fetal 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.100
 such we usually put tight they even 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.590
 and more expensive but insulation is best since 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 the troll in all respects we are accustomed 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.630
 such here is another door with the frame 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.630
 the door here so it is all inserted 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.910
 bounced off the door we generally are not wrong 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.410
 much here this one came to what you 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:41.890
 have seen it here another can say here 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:45.850
 we've got the door and here respectively 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:52.940
 accordingly, here is a heavy one 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.920
 nice clear yes here on the pen of liza 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:01.490
 barrels that there laid on the design yes here 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.020
 while probably all as far as I know 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.800
 today must paint the walls but how 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:15.400
 already 9 am and no one yet 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.400
 so we will not wait
