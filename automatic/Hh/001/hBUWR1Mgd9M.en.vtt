00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
bad so I got this because I wanted to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.300

the agave and lip mask I thought it was
gonna<00:05:03.729> be<00:05:03.789> better<00:05:04.060> because<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.360> looked<00:05:04.569> a<00:05:04.689> lot

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
gonna be better because it looked a lot
