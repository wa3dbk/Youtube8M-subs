00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.530
 market a shopping center where the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.780

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.709
 shopping hellfest 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.690
 the equivalent of one month's worth of 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.920
 average business by realizing three 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 days in general it's still 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.490
 it's even a good operation 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 looking for nothing in particular at 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.450

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.239
 for everything that is merchandise a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 hundred euros we will stay 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.390
 reasonable and to finish the little 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.850
 Photo souvenir 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:03:00.030
 story to tell the ffs 2014 I was there 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:02.370
 for work the headbanging set for 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 to realize that we have a brain so 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.930
 we make movements with the head 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.910
 back and forth so the brain is typing 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
 a little forward a little bit backwards 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.380
 and here we say I'm alive then 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 when we have a lot of hair it takes a 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.940
 another dimension a kind of amplitude or 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.410
 brains tape more and more hard no 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.330
 this is the headbanging simply 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.280

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.630
 red carpet for the american rob zombie 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.190
 both musician and director 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 this gives a press conference 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.940
 before concert a little surreal at 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.590
 level of questions including this one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.579

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.530

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.880
 filmography of horror cinema
