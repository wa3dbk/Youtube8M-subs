 hi i am andre and this is the 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.389

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.389
 and bluetooht headset 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.380
 included is a handy charging cable 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.670
 the usb port also links through 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.770
 so you can use another device 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.169
 connect and charge you also get 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.480
 a car charger and an attachment you it 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.189
 first thing you notice when you enter the market 2 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.329
 holding your hands is that he is very sorry 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.259
 is small 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.570
 in addition, it also has a layer 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.160
 weight of 7 grams and therefore you feel it 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.270
 almost not that you have the headset in your ear 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.040
 have you sit 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.690
 the entire headset consists of hard 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.420
 plastic on the loose silicone 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.430
 attachments after the market 2 promises one 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.310
 stylish and handy bluetooht headset 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 to be with voice control when we look 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.090
 to the possibilities then they are in 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.770
 my with what you can expect from one 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.300
 contemporary headset 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.070
 apart from the usual functions such as 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.170
 record or hang up a conversation 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.000
 It is possible to whistle calls 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.950
 to adopt two devices 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.620
 connect at the same time through means 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.269
 of multipoint technology and you can 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.909
 use voice control to hold a conversation 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.200
 to accept or reject 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.999
 and you do that with the english terms 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.380
 answer and I continue 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:13.990
 by adding the deep sleep mode 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.240
 the market 2 can be up to 11 days standby 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.850
 and has maximum talk time 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 seven hours if you would like to go to music 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.689
 want to listen then that is of course 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.219
 with this headset also possible the music 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.479
 naturally stops as the phone 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.579
 is ringing 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.950
 two microphones are present internally 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.079
 and of course there is also noise reduction 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.609
 the quality of the calls is good 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.490
 but sometimes it worked 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.049
 Noise reduction not entirely optimal 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.030
 to see more information about 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.979
 the market 2 you can use the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.259
 my head set application from plantronics 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 where for example you also have conversations 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.829
 can record 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.310
 despite the noise reduction sometimes 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.469
 could have been a little better 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.569
 is the plantronics marque 2 a good one 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.060
