00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.160
 Hmm 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.910
 me 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:19.450
 alba. Hello, everyone can see the net 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.710
 Only by looking at score up limited practice course lesson 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.710
 This time is a tea shot 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:36.030
 I think that you will often get the driver in the hall on the third floor of the fur 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:43.200
 It is very important to earn a distance with the driver and release after the second shot 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 But I also'm true that would bend the ball in the other hand driver where this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.329
 Like a hall 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.730
 In the hall to get fairway is narrow or or ob to the eye 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.840
 Let's use fairway wood 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 The height of the tea-up 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.940
 Please tea up 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.940
 The position of the ball is on the left armpit 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.200
 The grip is 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.200
 Hold it short like this and try to beat it correctly 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.510
 Please keep a 70% swing so that you can keep balance at the finish 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.150
 As you can see from the above four points 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.450
 Do not be cautious just because you hold the fairway wood 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.020
 Keep a good shot and try hard 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 Let's capture 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 Let's hit it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.659
 How was everyone 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:07.710
 Raw student tee shot is directly connected to the score 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.710
 Let's by all means please try to practice from the next loud So met or your
