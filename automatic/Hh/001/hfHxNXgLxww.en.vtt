right there I think that's going to be a

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.089 
right there I think that's going to be a
huge<00:03:57.720> difference<00:03:58.049> maker<00:03:58.409> in<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.709> match<00:03:58.799> I

huge difference maker in this match I

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.469 
huge difference maker in this match I
think<00:03:59.129> Sheamus<00:03:59.519> are<00:03:59.699> going<00:03:59.849> to<00:03:59.909> roll<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.299> and

think Sheamus are going to roll in and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.170 
think Sheamus are going to roll in and
perhaps<00:04:00.810> retain<00:04:01.259> his<00:04:01.379> championship<00:04:01.409> now<00:04:02.189> what
