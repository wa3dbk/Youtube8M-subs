the<00:01:02.370> yarn<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.909> same<00:01:03.179> fashion<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.650> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the yarn in the same fashion then we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490 
the yarn in the same fashion then we
simply<00:01:05.280> let<00:01:05.700> our<00:01:05.850> needle<00:01:06.150> guide<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.960> yarn<00:01:07.230> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
simply let our needle guide the yarn to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.730 
simply let our needle guide the yarn to
the<00:01:07.800> back<00:01:08.570> that's<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> give<00:01:10.050> us<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.409> loop

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the back that's going to give us a loop

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.969 
the back that's going to give us a loop
around<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:12.030> left<00:01:12.270> hand<00:01:12.540> needle<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> then

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
around our left hand needle and then

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.790 
around our left hand needle and then
just<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.670> would<00:01:15.080> at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.260> end<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.620> knit

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
just like we would at the end of a knit

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.910 
just like we would at the end of a knit
stitch<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:18.150> slide<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.750> existing<00:01:19.290> stitch<00:01:19.560> off

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
stitch we slide the existing stitch off

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.730 
stitch we slide the existing stitch off
let's<00:01:20.910> do<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.210> again<00:01:22.040> left<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:24.740> wrap

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
let's do that again left to right wrap

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.620 
let's do that again left to right wrap
around<00:01:27.410> through<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> back<00:01:29.540> there's<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
around through to the back there's a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
around through to the back there's a
loop<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.520> slide<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.980> left-hander

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
loop and slide off now as a left-hander

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.250 
loop and slide off now as a left-hander
one<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.480> I<00:01:36.510> have<00:01:36.780> found<00:01:37.080> that's

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
one thing that I have found that's

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.670 
one thing that I have found that's
really<00:01:37.670> crucial<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.960> having<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.500> good

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
really crucial is having really good

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
really crucial is having really good
tension<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.490> order<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:42.660> be<00:01:42.930> able<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.850> get<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
tension in order to be able to get the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.890 
tension in order to be able to get the
purl<00:01:45.600> stitch<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.680> work<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> move<00:01:50.720> left<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
purl stitch to work and move left to

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.700 
purl stitch to work and move left to
right<00:01:52.250> wrap<00:01:53.250> around<00:01:53.930> notice<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.290> index

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
right wrap around notice how my index

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.290 
right wrap around notice how my index
finger<00:01:56.130> pivots<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.940> down<00:01:57.470> while<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:58.500> am

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
finger pivots up and down while I am

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.630 
finger pivots up and down while I am
getting<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.450> purl<00:02:00.720> stitch<00:02:00.870> ready<00:02:02.570> it's<00:02:03.570> up

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
getting the purl stitch ready it's up

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.839 
getting the purl stitch ready it's up
bring<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.390> by<00:02:07.290> bringing<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
bring it down and by bringing it down it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.229 
bring it down and by bringing it down it
really<00:02:09.330> helps<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> secure<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.580> yarn<00:02:11.819> when

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
really helps to secure the yarn when

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.559 
really helps to secure the yarn when
we're<00:02:12.420> ready<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:13.620> move<00:02:13.830> forward<00:02:14.390> once<00:02:15.390> we've

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
we're ready to move forward once we've

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.680 
we're ready to move forward once we've
done<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.680> keep<00:02:16.950> looping<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:18.209> keep<00:02:18.450> going

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
done that we keep looping we keep going

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.320 
done that we keep looping we keep going
we<00:02:19.260> keep<00:02:19.530> drawing<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.879> find<00:02:21.090> it's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
we keep drawing now if you find it's

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.420 
we keep drawing now if you find it's
getting<00:02:21.599> harder<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.170> harder<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.769> slide

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
getting harder and harder to slide

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.550 
getting harder and harder to slide
simply<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.959> stitches<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.499> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
simply take the stitches that you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.630 
simply take the stitches that you
already<00:02:25.769> have

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
already have

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
already have
bunch<00:02:27.060> them<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.600> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:29.040> bunching

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
bunch them up a little bit that bunching

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.420 
bunch them up a little bit that bunching
is<00:02:29.819> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> move<00:02:30.870> them<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.920> it's

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
is going to move them all up and it's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.699 
is going to move them all up and it's
going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> give<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.090> more<00:02:33.240> play<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
going to give a little more play for the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.390 
going to give a little more play for the
