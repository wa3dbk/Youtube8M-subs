the dough is going to be quite stuff but

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.090 
the dough is going to be quite stuff but
it<00:01:18.259> should<00:01:18.469> still<00:01:18.740> hold<00:01:19.039> its<00:01:19.280> shape<00:01:21.100> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it should still hold its shape and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.179 
it should still hold its shape and
that's<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.170> ready<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.409> bake<00:01:27.189> now

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
that's it now it's ready to bake now

tin<00:01:36.469> foil<00:01:38.079> which<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.289> well<00:01:39.500> greased<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.219> for

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
tin foil which is well greased but for

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.190 
tin foil which is well greased but for
some<00:01:40.700> reason<00:01:41.000> still<00:01:41.239> sticks<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.899> fat<00:01:42.020> bar

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
some reason still sticks to the fat bar

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.499 
some reason still sticks to the fat bar
bar<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:42.920> prefer<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.549> use<00:01:43.579> baking<00:01:44.420> paper<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
bar so I prefer to use baking paper the

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.809 
bar so I prefer to use baking paper the
baking<00:01:47.840> paper<00:01:47.989> I<00:01:48.439> still<00:01:48.920> grease<00:01:49.189> even<00:01:49.759> though

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
baking paper I still grease even though

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.639 
baking paper I still grease even though
I<00:01:49.849> know<00:01:49.969> it's<00:01:50.179> not<00:01:50.270> gonna<00:01:50.420> stick<00:01:50.719> because<00:01:50.959> you

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
I know it's not gonna stick because you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.719 
I know it's not gonna stick because you
know<00:01:51.799> but<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.280> tastes<00:01:52.489> good<00:01:54.250> but<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.399> baking

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
know but it tastes good but the baking

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.149 
know but it tastes good but the baking
paper<00:01:55.849> just<00:01:56.149> allows<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:57.349> fat<00:01:57.649> bar<00:01:57.799> bar<00:01:57.979> to

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
paper just allows the fat bar bar to

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.010 
paper just allows the fat bar bar to
extend<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:58.849> you<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.149> open<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.509> up<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.810> little

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
extend and you can open it up a little

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.469 
extend and you can open it up a little
more<00:02:00.409> easily<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:01.520> check<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:01.909> it's<00:02:02.090> done

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
more easily to check if it's done

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.410 
more easily to check if it's done
so<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.530> take<00:02:03.739> piece<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.099> dough<00:02:04.250> flatten<00:02:05.179> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
so just take piece of dough flatten it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.009 
so just take piece of dough flatten it
out<00:02:05.599> so<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.189> no<00:02:07.549> thicker<00:02:08.299> than<00:02:08.599> an<00:02:08.720> inch

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019

it's<00:02:09.799> two<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.160> half<00:02:10.280> centimeters<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:12.160> just

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
it's two and a half centimeters and just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.840 
it's two and a half centimeters and just
roughly<00:02:13.400> shape<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.970> into<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.600> flat<00:02:14.959> slab<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
roughly shape it into a flat slab and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.410 
roughly shape it into a flat slab and
wrap<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.000> loosely<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.889> baking<00:02:22.549> paper<00:02:22.790> so

you<00:02:26.420> can<00:02:26.569> open<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.989> later<00:02:27.139> on<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.620> how
