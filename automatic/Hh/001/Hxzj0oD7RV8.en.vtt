00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.419 
give her like those big eyes and make it
on<00:00:32.449> like<00:00:32.689> anime<00:00:34.690> thingamabob<00:00:35.690> err<00:00:35.719> and

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
on like anime thingamabob err and

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.410 
on like anime thingamabob err and
whatever<00:00:37.429> I<00:00:37.969> think<00:00:38.179> I<00:00:38.269> failed<00:00:38.569> but<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:40.420> tried

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
whatever I think I failed but I tried

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.919 
whatever I think I failed but I tried
and<00:00:42.109> I<00:00:42.859> mean<00:00:43.339> half<00:00:43.879> of<00:00:43.999> me<00:00:44.179> is<00:00:44.239> kind<00:00:44.539> of<00:00:44.629> like<00:00:44.690> I

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
and I mean half of me is kind of like I

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.629 
and I mean half of me is kind of like I
wish<00:00:45.139> I<00:00:45.260> just<00:00:45.289> left<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:45.859> as<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.039> line<00:00:46.339> art

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:46.639 
wish I just left it as a line art

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:50.020 
wish I just left it as a line art
because<00:00:47.149> I<00:00:47.859> feel<00:00:48.859> like<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.280> Lambo<00:00:49.760> liner

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
because I feel like the Lambo liner

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.449 
because I feel like the Lambo liner
itself<00:00:50.659> is<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:51.079> really<00:00:51.409> pretty<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.859> look<00:00:51.979> at

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:52.459 
itself is just really pretty to look at

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:58.949 
itself is just really pretty to look at
but<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:53.749> did<00:00:54.440> color<00:00:54.799> it<00:00:55.069> and<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:57.670> kind<00:00:58.670> of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
but I did color it and I kind of

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.359 
but I did color it and I kind of
struggled<00:00:59.959> with<00:01:00.139> the<00:01:00.260> background<00:01:00.799> because

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
struggled with the background because

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.570 
struggled with the background because
it's<00:01:01.670> such<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.119> small<00:01:02.779> piece<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.170> paper<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:03.829> I

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
it's such a small piece of paper and I

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.429 
it's such a small piece of paper and I
didn't<00:01:04.940> really<00:01:05.150> have<00:01:05.330> anywhere<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.810> go<00:01:06.229> with

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
didn't really have anywhere to go with

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.789 
didn't really have anywhere to go with
the<00:01:06.560> background<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.090> try<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:10.000> add<00:01:11.170> some<00:01:12.170> sort

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
the background so I try to add some sort

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.450 
the background so I try to add some sort
of<00:01:14.170> perspective<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.469> give<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.159> background

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
of perspective and give the background

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.200 
of perspective and give the background
some<00:01:17.060> space<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:18.049> like<00:01:18.490> how<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.520> did<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
some space with like how I did the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.380 
some space with like how I did the
clouds<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.640> mountain<00:01:22.640> or<00:01:22.909> whatever

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
clouds and the mountain or whatever

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.069 
clouds and the mountain or whatever
thingy<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.350> background<00:01:24.859> but<00:01:25.130> ha<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:26.570> don't

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
thingy in the background but ha I don't

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.190 
thingy in the background but ha I don't
know<00:01:27.289> what<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.979> background<00:01:28.460> was<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.640> struggle

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
know what the background was a struggle

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.789 
know what the background was a struggle
but<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:31.700> liked<00:01:32.090> how<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.299> character<00:01:32.899> came<00:01:33.530> out

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
but I I liked how the character came out

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.580 
but I I liked how the character came out
by<00:01:34.340> itself<00:01:34.880> I'm<00:01:35.600> not<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:36.109> big<00:01:36.350> fan<00:01:36.530> of

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
by itself I'm not a big fan of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.230 
by itself I'm not a big fan of
background<00:01:37.219> but<00:01:37.869> okay<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.890> can't<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.429> do

over the place

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.160 
over the place
so<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.950> added<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.700> trying<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.600> cover<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
so that added to the trying to cover the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.220 
so that added to the trying to cover the
background<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.310> like<00:03:27.600> darker<00:03:28.600> green
