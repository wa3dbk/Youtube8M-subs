always<00:01:13.830> good<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> guess<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
always good to and how I guess it is

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.320 
always good to and how I guess it is
already<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.950> her<00:01:17.189> mine<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> my

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
already but I her mine I was just in my

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.480

house<00:01:18.570> over<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.890> heard<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
house over here and I heard a like a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
house over here and I heard a like a
bark<00:01:20.759> sound<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.630> went<00:01:21.840> outside<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bark sound and I went outside and I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
bark sound and I went outside and I
realized<00:01:23.159> they'd<00:01:23.280> actually<00:01:23.460> installed<00:01:24.060> her

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
realized they'd actually installed her

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
realized they'd actually installed her
mountains<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.590> added<00:01:25.920> wolves<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
mountains all but added wolves in the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
mountains all but added wolves in the
Warcraft<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> point<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.290> took<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> fog

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
Warcraft at this point I took it the fog

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
Warcraft at this point I took it the fog
and<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.270> pretty<00:01:30.390> surprised<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> one

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and so I was pretty surprised the one

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
and so I was pretty surprised the one
that<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.590> did<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> found<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that they did and I found one and I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.749 
that they did and I found one and I
looked<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:34.070> google<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.250> how<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> tame

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
looked up on google about how to tame

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.530 
looked up on google about how to tame
them<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.299> i<00:01:36.360> guess<00:01:36.630> i<00:01:38.090> assuming<00:01:39.090> adding<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
them so i guess i assuming adding to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.429 
them so i guess i assuming adding to
myself<00:01:39.900> some<00:01:40.670> bones<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.960> don't<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.290> them

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
myself some bones if you don't have them

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429 
myself some bones if you don't have them
i<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.829> find<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:45.049> mob<00:01:46.049> spawner

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
i think you can find them in mob spawner

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
i think you can find them in mob spawner
rooms<00:01:46.979> chest<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.979> then<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.340> skeletons

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
rooms chest and then I think skeletons

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.530 
rooms chest and then I think skeletons
crop<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.479> tomorrow<00:01:53.090> probably<00:01:54.090> am<00:01:56.090> yeah<00:01:57.090> ok

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
crop them tomorrow probably am yeah ok

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.220 
crop them tomorrow probably am yeah ok
so<00:01:57.600> once<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.409> oh<00:01:58.969> wait<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.329> just
