00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.899
 Welcome to the summer here 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 when hiking the line technology and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.020
 lifestyle seems beautiful that you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.300
 take a look at these midsummer 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 Temperatures at least here in the north 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 we have 32 degrees right here or today 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.420
 had or even a bit about it in 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 it may not look that way south 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.109
 nice but what if this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 review in the winter look turns 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 anyway ask what is actually talking 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.000
 Today it's about music and you see 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 here's what my neck is about dangling 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 the jobs because it is in ear headphones and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.649
 I would like today we imagine 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
 want to clarify if that was it but on the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.180
 quality packaging writes because 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.820
 really it looks at you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.820
 after our little intro to the same 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 new yorks maybe it was unpacked 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.860
 that we are you, that's all there is to it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 on the boss itself are already two 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 small on it if you get it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.610
 are still three other sizes the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.619
 You should also be able to exchange 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.000
 then we have the ios to the come 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.009
 could probably take just now 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.869
 already and he to a likely 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.210
 book leads you are you still have one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.149
 clip and hold the cables together 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.369
 a usb charging cable for typical one 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.470
 transport bag protection bag for the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.640
 headphones and of course one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.929
 manual in various languages 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.520
 the box allows high quality 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.819
 Processed they are made of plastic 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 and made of metal and are of one or 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.830
 with a ribbon cable that I do not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.590
 can entangle connected with each other 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.140
 the whole coated here a cable 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.909
 there is also one 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 Remote control also looks very high quality 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.000
 from plusminus for the volume and for 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.409
 title leaps and in the middle the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.770
 multifunction buttons with which he to 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.750
 for example, if you are using bluetooth with 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.819
 who wanted to connect the dream of the white 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.450
 The connection could be easy 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:03.929
 five seconds on it and press on the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.550
 blue signal or the feedback in the 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.190
 headphones are waiting for you too 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.259
 I could not connect through nfc 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.260
 try but know that cups 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.629
 works really well for one 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.000
 good sound it is absolutely important that 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.129
 we used the right earpads 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.610
 so you should all do it with it 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.950
 also delivers on the try and then on 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.800
 best too with the sound of java then 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.340
 you even have dolby digital plus on 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.010
 the ears 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.180
 baby exchange I'll show you now 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.040
 thats is quite easy 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.000
 Here's just a little more 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 cushion this silicone and could 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.550
 then just as expensive 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.690
 sit on 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.860
 it's all very easy and then 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.580
 you should do it all the time 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.420
 listen to 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.090
 then it is important for the sound and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.980
 Of course, for the seat that you 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.260
 right earpads wild for the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.070
 proper fit is also important 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.900
 if she's afraid that you have the rocks 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 fall out of the ears both are yes stop 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.300
 a little bit bigger and feel on 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.330
 beginning a bit is unusual about 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.760
 the so-called airways you can 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.150
 even sit on it sit the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.820
 box really perfect and tight in the ear 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.720
 without the whole presses that are too 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.400
 very soft and he feels it 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.730
 one day not at all and with it 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.890
 the rockstar is really perfect in there 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.470
 Ear also when we sport the attaches 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.959
 I'll show you that too I would 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.930
 recommend the verdict further decrease 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.580
 that is easier then and you have to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.040
 head left the mark 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.020
 and right on the one, of course, and the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.480
 you have the same mark as well 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.810
 you have to say that in july 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.090
 but so bring into coincidence that the l 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.800
 or that he is in the right one each 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.530
 direction or in the same direction 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.440
 time and then it could all be here 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.370
 Just touch it is over 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.739
 silicone said quite soft 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.430
 You can do that a bit too 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.980
 so that you can do that later, even if 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.320
 this default is not here 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.430
 should be true for you 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.740
 then you can also do that and 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.240
 and ear adjust pay attention should 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.490
 her the microphone that i here 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.199
 is not covered and then 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.199
 can you at already back on her 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.750
 cushion or the clock in case of choice 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.520
 put on it and try it too 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.550
 just the different sizes of 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.860
 ios and which looks you best 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.210
 fit 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.800
 The battery lasts for about six hours 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.810
 music and five and a half hours 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.509
 call and then have to go to the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.780
 socket and charged values ​​over 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:57.330
 USB cable you can behind the 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.970
 Connecting flap of the left headphone 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.660
 we see here and then there was 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.320
 just insert the cable and then into the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.840
 charger from device or to the usb in 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.240
 the usb port of a computer and then 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.949
 It will be in about one and a half hours 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.660
 fully charged again 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.430
 Of course I want you to have a feature 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.560
 not withheld and that is the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.970
 possibility the ava rocks in the standby 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.070
 to shift the mode 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.590
 and then she would just have to 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.169
 back the magnetic together 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.970
 then yes then connect with each other 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.460
 and are automatically in the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.810
 standby mode set and we save 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.889
 By doing so, of course, if he has electricity 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.039
 takes apart again 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.080
 then they will be reconnected immediately 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.909
 with your device is the green light 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.770
 then the blue and you can already 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.440
 Again , they have music together 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.630
 she said comfortably around her neck and 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.270
 do not be afraid to have them 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.630
 loses a really good idea like me 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.590
 think that has come up as the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.729
 Sperm whales are really under 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.500
 Everyday earphones for all those 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.220
 so a little more independent of cables 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.349
 want to be 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.729
 They also hold up well during sports 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.009
 in the ears also a bit bigger 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.000
 are always just part of the unix 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:16.259
 use and fit the appropriate one 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.419
 was upholstery associations in terms of sound 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.900
 for a little too little pastor 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.479
 I like her 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.430
 with more but this is really 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.560
 matter of taste sounds easy 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.199
 and then decide for yourself if they will 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.789
 liked or not we know 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.380
