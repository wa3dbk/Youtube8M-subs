00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.250 

a<00:00:58.520> basic<00:00:59.520> modification<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> truck<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a basic modification to the truck as you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.240 
a basic modification to the truck as you
can<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:02.700> addition<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.630> supercharger

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
can see the addition of the supercharger

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.290 
can see the addition of the supercharger
will<00:01:05.250> give<00:01:05.370> you<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:05.520> idea<00:01:05.550> how<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.910> runs<00:01:06.060> here

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
will give you an idea how it runs here

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.690 
will give you an idea how it runs here
in<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> minute<00:01:06.980> but<00:01:07.980> we're<00:01:08.160> over<00:01:08.310> riveting

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
in just a minute but we're over riveting

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.220 
in just a minute but we're over riveting
the<00:01:08.790> blower<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.660> one<00:01:09.870> point<00:01:10.080> three

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
the blower here about one point three

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.380 
the blower here about one point three
three<00:01:10.620> two<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.400> we're<00:01:11.910> talking<00:01:12.060> probably

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
three two one so we're talking probably

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
three two one so we're talking probably
20,000<00:01:13.080> rpm<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.590> blower<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.670> we'll<00:01:15.270> show<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
20,000 rpm on blower and we'll show you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.610 
20,000 rpm on blower and we'll show you
exactly<00:01:15.600> how<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> thing<00:01:16.200> around<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.560> in

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
exactly how the thing around here in

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.570 
exactly how the thing around here in
just<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.340> moment

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.030 

it's<00:01:22.420> also<00:01:22.600> eliminated<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.350> lot<00:01:23.380> with<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.950> new

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
it's also eliminated a lot with the new

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.590 
it's also eliminated a lot with the new
power<00:01:24.220> added<00:01:24.490> power<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.000> engine<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.330> isn't

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
power added power the engine that isn't

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620 
power added power the engine that isn't
lugging<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:25.990> hard<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:27.730> also<00:01:27.910> have<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> ones

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
lugging is hard and we also have a ones

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.050 
lugging is hard and we also have a ones
have<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> shroud<00:01:30.370> going<00:01:30.700> around<00:01:30.940> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
have a have a shroud going around the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.040 
have a have a shroud going around the
radiator<00:01:31.360> now<00:01:31.690> with<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.530> very<00:01:32.890> high<00:01:33.280> speed<00:01:37.050> it's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
radiator now with a very high speed it's

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.810 
radiator now with a very high speed it's
I<00:01:38.290> think<00:01:39.160> 235<00:01:40.030> CFM<00:01:40.690> electric<00:01:41.380> motor<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:42.580> it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
I think 235 CFM electric motor it's it's

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.650 
I think 235 CFM electric motor it's it's
one<00:01:43.480> of<00:01:43.570> these<00:01:45.180> electronic<00:01:46.180> motors<00:01:46.510> which

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
one of these electronic motors which

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.540 
one of these electronic motors which
which<00:01:46.870> doesn't<00:01:47.140> draw<00:01:47.290> all<00:01:47.770> motors<00:01:48.100> electronic

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
which doesn't draw all motors electronic

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.430 
which doesn't draw all motors electronic
of<00:01:48.610> course<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:49.480> it's<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.960> motors

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
of course but it's one of the motors

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.920 
of course but it's one of the motors
doesn't<00:01:50.650> roll<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.800> lot<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.010> current<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:51.930> we'll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
doesn't roll a lot of current so we'll

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.860 
doesn't roll a lot of current so we'll
give<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.140> an<00:01:53.230> idea<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.470> its<00:01:53.710> life
