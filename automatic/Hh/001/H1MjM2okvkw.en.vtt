00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.550 

I<00:00:14.330> get<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> lot<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> questions<00:00:16.110> when<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.350> comes

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
I get a lot of questions when it comes

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
I get a lot of questions when it comes
to<00:00:16.830> rest<00:00:17.430> pause<00:00:18.380> technique<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.029> most<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
to rest pause technique and most of you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.620 
to rest pause technique and most of you
know<00:00:21.599> rest<00:00:21.990> pause<00:00:22.380> from<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.460> shortcut<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.390> size

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
know rest pause from my shortcut to size

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.320 
know rest pause from my shortcut to size
program<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.740> also<00:00:26.189> incorporate<00:00:27.090> rest

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
program but I also incorporate rest

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.140 
program but I also incorporate rest
pause<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> lot<00:00:28.020> of<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.320> other<00:00:28.920> programs<00:00:29.790> as

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
pause in a lot of my other programs as

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.020 
pause in a lot of my other programs as
well<00:00:30.950> the<00:00:31.950> questions<00:00:32.399> though<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> get

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
well the questions though that I get

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
well the questions though that I get
unrest<00:00:33.420> pause<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.040> well<00:00:35.040> first<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> how

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
unrest pause is well first of all is how

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880 
unrest pause is well first of all is how
do<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
do you do it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
do you do it
precisely<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:40.370> does<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> count<00:00:41.940> as

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
precisely and then does that count as

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.709 
precisely and then does that count as
one<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> sets<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.730> shortcut<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
one of the sets so with shortcut the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.819 
one of the sets so with shortcut the
size<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.320> example<00:00:47.359> the<00:00:48.359> first<00:00:48.660> exercise<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
size for example the first exercise that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.360 
size for example the first exercise that
you<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.519> for<00:00:51.420> each<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.589> most<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you do for each for well most of the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.599 
you do for each for well most of the
main<00:00:54.500> muscle<00:00:55.500> groups<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.859> chest<00:00:56.370> for

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
main muscle groups like chest for

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.060 
main muscle groups like chest for
example<00:00:57.089> that<00:00:57.449> first<00:00:57.510> exercise<00:00:58.019> bench<00:00:58.710> press

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
example that first exercise bench press

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.319 
example that first exercise bench press
you<00:00:59.339> do<00:00:59.820> four<00:01:00.210> sets<00:01:00.710> now<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> rest<00:01:03.030> pause

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you do four sets now you do a rest pause

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.380 
you do four sets now you do a rest pause
on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.470> last<00:01:04.710> set<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> fourth<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.150> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
on the last set on the fourth set so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
on the last set on the fourth set so
what<00:01:06.570> does<00:01:06.690> that<00:01:06.720> mean<00:01:07.140> does<00:01:07.620> that<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.980> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
what does that mean does that mean you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.810 
what does that mean does that mean you
do<00:01:08.220> three<00:01:08.520> sets<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.120> then<00:01:09.570> rest<00:01:09.990> pause<00:01:10.820> counts

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
do three sets and then rest pause counts

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
do three sets and then rest pause counts
as<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.540> fourth<00:01:13.500> set<00:01:13.770> no<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.820> do

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
as the fourth set no you actually do

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
as the fourth set no you actually do
four<00:01:15.870> sets<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.890> rest<00:01:17.100> periods<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
four sets with your rest periods and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
four sets with your rest periods and
then<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> fourth<00:01:18.990> set<00:01:19.439> after<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> muscle

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
then on the fourth set after a muscle

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
then on the fourth set after a muscle
failure<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.240> rest<00:01:21.479> pause<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> rez

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
failure you do rest pause what is rez

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.730 
failure you do rest pause what is rez
pause<00:01:22.979> well<00:01:23.250> let's<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.689> through<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
pause well let's take you through how to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.370 
pause well let's take you through how to
do<00:01:26.070> rest<00:01:26.610> pause<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.299> let's<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.960> say<00:01:28.079> this<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
do rest pause and let's just say this is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.359 
do rest pause and let's just say this is
my<00:01:28.560> last<00:01:28.939> set<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.719> exercise<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
my last set of this exercise so you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
my last set of this exercise so you
don't<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.969> do<00:01:33.119> rest<00:01:33.360> pause<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.899> just<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
don't have to do rest pause on just the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
don't have to do rest pause on just the
last<00:01:34.530> set<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:34.979> exercise<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
last set of each exercise but I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.600 
last set of each exercise but I
typically<00:01:36.710> incorporate<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> last<00:01:38.250> set

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
typically incorporate it on the last set

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
typically incorporate it on the last set
just<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.600> fatigue<00:01:40.590> your

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
just so that you don't fatigue your

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
just so that you don't fatigue your
muscle<00:01:41.670> groups<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.170> previous

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
muscle groups so much on the previous

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.639 
muscle groups so much on the previous
sets<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.670> hampers<00:01:44.969> your<00:01:45.329> strength<00:01:45.810> later

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
sets that it hampers your strength later

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
sets that it hampers your strength later
on<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> second<00:01:48.509> or

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
on on those you know that second or

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
on on those you know that second or
third<00:01:48.840> or<00:01:49.110> fourth<00:01:49.439> set<00:01:50.130> later<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
third or fourth set later on so I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.270 
third or fourth set later on so I
typically<00:01:51.299> save<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.049> last<00:01:52.289> set<00:01:52.680> when

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
typically save it for that last set when

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
typically save it for that last set when
you're<00:01:53.460> basically<00:01:54.000> done<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> moving<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you're basically done and moving on to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.849 
you're basically done and moving on to
another<00:01:55.259> exercise<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.359> rest<00:01:57.600> pause<00:01:57.930> you

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
another exercise so with rest pause you

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.029 
another exercise so with rest pause you
basically<00:01:59.640> take<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.329> set<00:02:00.659> all<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.859> way<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
basically take the set all the way to

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.399 
basically take the set all the way to
failure<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:02.880> doing<00:02:03.149> tricep<00:02:03.630> press

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
failure so if I'm doing tricep press

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
failure so if I'm doing tricep press
downs<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.189> example<00:02:05.759> you're<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> go

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
downs for example you're going to go

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.249 
downs for example you're going to go
let's<00:02:07.320> say<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:07.859> third<00:02:08.190> set<00:02:09.259> hugging

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
let's say this is my third set hugging

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.250 
let's say this is my third set hugging
the<00:02:10.350> 12<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> 15<00:02:11.690> rep<00:02:12.690> range<00:02:13.050> say<00:02:13.470> I'm<00:02:14.460> going

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.869 

and<00:02:17.560> then<00:02:17.830> when<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> hit<00:02:18.400> failure<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.379> to

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
and then when I hit failure I'm going to

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.699 
and then when I hit failure I'm going to
put<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.000> weight<00:02:22.180> down<00:02:23.160> watch<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.489> clock<00:02:24.760> rest

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
put the weight down watch the clock rest

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.390 
put the weight down watch the clock rest
somewhere<00:02:26.709> around<00:02:27.959> 15<00:02:28.959> seconds<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
somewhere around 15 seconds and you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.220 
somewhere around 15 seconds and you
don't<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.849> be<00:02:30.970> exact<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.959> 10

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
don't have to be exact it can be 10

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.160 
don't have to be exact it can be 10
seconds<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.310> could<00:02:33.489> be<00:02:33.640> 20<00:02:34.150> seconds<00:02:34.660> but

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
seconds it could be 20 seconds but

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.610 
seconds it could be 20 seconds but
somewhere<00:02:35.709> around<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.130> 15-second<00:02:37.120> mark

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
somewhere around that 15-second mark

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.650 
somewhere around that 15-second mark
once<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.830> time<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.330> back

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
once that time is up I go right back

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.860 
once that time is up I go right back
with<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> same<00:02:42.040> exact<00:02:42.580> weight<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.360> I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
with the same exact weight and I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.979 
with the same exact weight and I
continue<00:02:44.440> doing<00:02:45.030> reps<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.360> exercise

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.430 

again<00:02:49.989> until<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> hit<00:02:54.180> muscle<00:02:55.180> failure<00:02:55.440> it's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
again until I hit muscle failure it's

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.390 
again until I hit muscle failure it's
that<00:02:56.709> simple<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:58.329> that<00:02:58.510> simple<00:02:58.540> now

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
that simple it's really that simple now

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.530 
that simple it's really that simple now
there's<00:03:00.400> different<00:03:00.610> ways<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.000> incorporate

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
there's different ways to incorporate

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.110 
there's different ways to incorporate
rest<00:03:01.989> pause<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:03.099> most<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.430> my<00:03:03.549> programs

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
rest pause but for most of my programs

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.440 
rest pause but for most of my programs
this<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.200> style<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.769> rest<00:03:06.069> pause<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:07.150> I'm

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
this is the style of rest pause that I'm

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.250 
this is the style of rest pause that I'm
talking<00:03:08.170> about<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.019> take

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
talking about so it's just that you take

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.240 
talking about so it's just that you take
that<00:03:11.440> set<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:12.700> muscle<00:03:13.420> failure<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.099> then<00:03:15.099> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
that set to muscle failure and then the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.670 
that set to muscle failure and then the
rest<00:03:15.459> pause<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:16.060> not<00:03:16.269> on<00:03:16.450> another<00:03:16.930> set<00:03:17.380> it's

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
rest pause is not on another set it's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.039 
rest pause is not on another set it's
just<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.190> continuation<00:03:19.090> or<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.420> set<00:03:19.840> that

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
just the continuation or that set that

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.140 
just the continuation or that set that
you<00:03:20.530> reach<00:03:20.799> muscle<00:03:21.099> failure<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.850> because

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
you reach muscle failure on because

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.629 
you reach muscle failure on because
you're<00:03:22.299> only<00:03:22.450> resting<00:03:22.989> about<00:03:23.260> 15<00:03:24.069> seconds

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
you're only resting about 15 seconds

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.780 
you're only resting about 15 seconds
we're<00:03:25.569> considering<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.829> same<00:03:27.160> set

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
we're considering it the same set

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.550 
we're considering it the same set
because<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.239> really<00:03:28.569> didn't<00:03:28.870> rest<00:03:29.079> long

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
because you really didn't rest long

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.050 
because you really didn't rest long
enough<00:03:29.859> that's<00:03:30.010> what<00:03:30.190> we<00:03:30.280> call<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.549> rest<00:03:30.730> pause

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
enough that's what we call it rest pause

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.410 
enough that's what we call it rest pause
it's<00:03:31.900> not<00:03:32.200> really<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> rest<00:03:33.100> making<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.090> two

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
it's not really a rest making that two

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.470 
it's not really a rest making that two
different<00:03:34.540> sets<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:36.310> really<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.940> just

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
different sets it's really like just

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.620 
different sets it's really like just
taking<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.900> brief<00:03:38.230> little<00:03:39.130> pause<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.940> then

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
taking a brief little pause and then

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.750 
taking a brief little pause and then
you're<00:03:40.810> continuing<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.549> weight<00:03:42.730> in

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
you're continuing with the weight in

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.879 
you're continuing with the weight in
fact<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.389> some<00:03:43.630> exercises<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:44.799> to

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
fact on some exercises you don't have to

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.949 
fact on some exercises you don't have to
put<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.190> weight<00:03:45.370> down<00:03:45.400> like<00:03:46.090> squats<00:03:46.810> for

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
put the weight down like squats for

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.020 
put the weight down like squats for
example<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> choice<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.880> can

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
example you have the choice of you can

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.550 
example you have the choice of you can
stick<00:03:49.359> if<00:03:49.600> it's<00:03:49.780> comfortable<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.470> want

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
stick if it's comfortable and you want

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.690 
stick if it's comfortable and you want
to<00:03:50.709> stand<00:03:50.920> there<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.400> bar<00:03:52.120> on<00:03:52.450> your<00:03:52.720> back

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
to stand there with the bar on your back

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.879 
to stand there with the bar on your back
before<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.900> continue<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.680> can<00:03:56.799> just

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
before you continue on you can just

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.759 
before you continue on you can just
stand<00:03:57.160> there<00:03:57.340> for<00:03:57.519> 15<00:03:57.880> seconds<00:03:58.410> which<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.650> I

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
stand there for 15 seconds which like I

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.300 
stand there for 15 seconds which like I
said<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.130> pause<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.420> rest<00:04:01.690> pause<00:04:02.200> or<00:04:03.069> you

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
said a pause it's a rest pause or you

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.309 
said a pause it's a rest pause or you
can<00:04:03.459> unrack<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.359> but<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> lot<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.750> times<00:04:04.989> like<00:04:05.079> to

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
can unrack it but a lot of times like to

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.690 
can unrack it but a lot of times like to
squaw<00:04:05.680> by<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.489> time<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.940> unrack<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.410> then

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
squaw by the time you unrack it and then

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.000 
squaw by the time you unrack it and then
get<00:04:09.700> set<00:04:10.000> back<00:04:10.150> up<00:04:10.359> again<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:10.840> 15<00:04:11.470> seconds<00:04:11.950> or

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
get set back up again it's 15 seconds or

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.949 
get set back up again it's 15 seconds or
already<00:04:12.190> over<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:13.060> lot<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.569> times<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.840> might

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
already over so a lot of times you might

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.330 
already over so a lot of times you might
as<00:04:14.079> well<00:04:14.169> just<00:04:14.410> stand<00:04:14.739> there<00:04:14.799> with<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.130> weight

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
as well just stand there with the weight

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.690 
as well just stand there with the weight
on<00:04:15.669> your<00:04:16.079> shoulder<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.590> can<00:04:18.099> kind<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.370> see

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
on your shoulder so you can kind of see

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.640 
on your shoulder so you can kind of see
with<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.090> example<00:04:19.539> where<00:04:19.930> it's<00:04:20.109> not<00:04:20.229> really

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
with that example where it's not really

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.920 
with that example where it's not really
a<00:04:20.680> whole<00:04:21.489> new<00:04:21.789> set<00:04:22.180> now<00:04:22.389> it's<00:04:22.599> just<00:04:22.720> like

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
a whole new set now it's just like

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.020 
a whole new set now it's just like
you're<00:04:23.110> taking<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.830> little<00:04:24.010> pause<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.669> between

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you're taking a little pause in between

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.030 
you're taking a little pause in between
reps<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.930> then<00:04:26.200> continuing

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
reps and then continuing

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.540 
reps and then continuing
the<00:04:27.700> set<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.390> hope<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.560> helps<00:04:29.980> for<00:04:30.400> those

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
the set so I hope that helps for those

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.790 
the set so I hope that helps for those
of<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.940> who<00:04:31.330> are<00:04:31.870> having<00:04:32.080> trouble<00:04:32.350> sort<00:04:32.740> of

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
of you who are having trouble sort of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.220 
of you who are having trouble sort of
understanding<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> rest<00:04:33.970> pause<00:04:34.360> technique

understanding the rest pause technique

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.560 
understanding the rest pause technique
it's<00:04:35.920> like<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.340> said<00:04:36.400> that's<00:04:36.760> simple<00:04:37.360> you're

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
it's like I said that's simple you're

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.960 
it's like I said that's simple you're
just<00:04:37.780> taking<00:04:37.930> a<00:04:38.200> brief<00:04:38.530> little<00:04:39.250> pause<00:04:39.640> in

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
just taking a brief little pause in

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.000 
just taking a brief little pause in
between<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.420> set<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.080> then<00:04:41.260> continuing<00:04:41.890> on

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
between that set and then continuing on

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.650 
between that set and then continuing on
to<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.220> same<00:04:42.610> exact<00:04:43.000> weight<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.480> you're

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
to the same exact weight that you're

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.530 
to the same exact weight that you're
using<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.530> doesn't<00:04:44.980> count<00:04:45.250> as<00:04:45.550> one<00:04:46.300> of<00:04:46.420> those

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
using it doesn't count as one of those

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.810 
using it doesn't count as one of those
sets<00:04:46.900> if<00:04:47.320> you're<00:04:47.830> supposed<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.220> doing<00:04:48.340> 4

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
sets if you're supposed to be doing 4

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.840 
sets if you're supposed to be doing 4
sets<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.420> exercise<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.440> do<00:04:50.680> all<00:04:50.980> 4<00:04:51.460> sets

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
sets of that exercise you do all 4 sets

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.840 
sets of that exercise you do all 4 sets
then<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.870> rest<00:04:53.110> pause<00:04:53.380> comes<00:04:53.800> at<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.520> end<00:04:54.550> of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
then the rest pause comes at the end of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.150 
then the rest pause comes at the end of
that<00:04:54.940> fourth<00:04:55.270> set<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:55.840> three<00:04:56.200> sets<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:57.010> do

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
that fourth set it's three sets you do

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.980 
that fourth set it's three sets you do
all<00:04:57.340> three<00:04:57.670> sets<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.300> then<00:04:58.690> when<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.930> hit

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
all three sets and then when you hit

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.170 
all three sets and then when you hit
failure<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.590> third<00:04:59.830> set<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.670> do<00:05:00.970> that

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
failure in the third set you do that

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.370 
failure in the third set you do that
rest-pause<00:05:01.600> set<00:05:02.580> that's<00:05:03.580> rest<00:05:04.210> pause<00:05:04.480> in<00:05:04.870> a

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
rest-pause set that's rest pause in a

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.640 
rest-pause set that's rest pause in a
