00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:11.210
 good good good good blame the bad 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 Hi guys, it's okay, just play in the church. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.670
 Are you watching my picture? 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 fish journey where throughout this law 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm going through several tips on 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 supplementation option aiming at 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 weight loss 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.960
 today will be a special tip on the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 protein supplementation, ie 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.140
 more efficient and effective supplementation 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 exist 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 let's start with the famous and popular 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.570
 most dear of all is the protein 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 the huawei is a supplementation is based on 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 whey protein or even 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.309
 the serum of retinal 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.879
 only source protein and turn into powder 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.820
 all of them are powder without flavor etc. 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.030
 and what is the differential of what he has 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.149
 rapid digestion and absorption, ie you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 takes that protein quickly and is 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.460
 degraded in amino acids and goes where 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
 you need to promote blood for 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 fabrics etc. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.580
 the industry has basically three 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 gil titles and that is the one and concentrated i 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 isolated and hydrolyzed to my god 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 Any difference, huh? 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 First, there is a difference in the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.460
 production and secondly, there is 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.650
 price and concentrated would be the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 that is to say, taken from the serum of 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.329
 hydration or the pop ready book 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.720
 has rough has a little carbohydrate one 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.200
 little fat the industry goes there and gives 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 a refined one in this 8 has concentrated and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.880
 Pro is viewed there takes isolated ie 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 worker had alternative to lactose 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.549
 take away everything that has around you right 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.520
 roughly it is a better product is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.130
 for so it is pure and there comes the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 hydrolyzed huawei which is a kind of well 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.810
 more expensive you can observe, that is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 differentiated protein is more expensive and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.750
 with his differential 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.440
 they take the isolated and break this law 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.180
 in order to facilitate 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.400
 but it's management or when you take 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.260
 a goal and hydrolyzed protein you 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.810
 is practically working amino acids 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.210
 pure you take that time will already 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 pro boy take blood is totally 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.320
 Who has taken Saturday when you take 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.280
 a dose or hydrolyzed for you to take 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.230
 a glass of water 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.720
 You do not feel anything. The management is super. 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.000
 ultra mega fast then it is very indicated 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.380
 for those who have stomach trouble to 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.900
 who has a sad look at who takes 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.580
 the efficient maltese in the stomach or 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.920
 performance athletes who are 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.440
 one thing that really has great 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.160
 digestion and absorption there by passing a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.220
 forward 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.590
 we have a blend, it would be a mixture of 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.360
 there are many versions of the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.220
 market transmission of various types of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.370
 this protein is a mixture of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 house and not with it I have and combines or 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.320
 be the goal of these blends in these mix 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.470
 protein is different type of absorption 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.200
 in a product only you take the first is 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.630
 absorbed after albumin and finally to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.310
 casein for example is pretty cool because 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.070
 you maintain that amino acid profile 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.810
 in your blood for longer 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.510
 I do not have it here because I do not use it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.030
 taste but also has something to mine 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.610
 moment is egg white protein 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.489
 sure does not matter - dehydrate the clear 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.530
 of the egg turns into a powder and the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.540
 It's pretty slow that it 's pretty cool to take the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
 night as well as caffeine and 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.280
 to finalize a protein that is not new 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.989
 supplementation both in the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.030
 abroad as here in Brazil that the 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.769
 meat protein is the protein in meat 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.560
 Red even if we say that is the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.550
 pro kiss is the guy and I go in the versions 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 Americans are picking up protein in meat 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.010
 even if they take this protein 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.900
 dehydration and make the right powder is well 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.269
 Legal also fast protein management 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.030
 alone is slightly more concentrated in 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.709
 iron to give if then so has 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.140
 very cool results. 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.459
 new protein much younger than ei mas 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.420
 it's a way you go to your 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.400
 Implementation 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.650
 it's not that it 's better or worse than enem 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.130
 no it's just different it comes in taste 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.660
 chocolate but the market already 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.760
 have released some of the flavors do not have 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 meat flavor itabom people then this is 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.959
 the basic difference 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.519
 between the most common types of protein 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.990
 in our diet so I use it 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.330
 recommended because it is a product 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.400
 excellent for you both gain mass 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.360
 how to burn fat and keep your 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.470
 muscle mass 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.849
 It's good, I hope you liked it. 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.849
 The tip is more
