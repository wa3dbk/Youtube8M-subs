00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone welcome for a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.150
 new video focus on call of duty 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.099
 advanced warfare today we're going 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.400
 talk about the difference between the ball 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.870
 27 obsidian steed and the carbon version 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.089
 since it is true that there carbon 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.170
 general rule is a little bit popular 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.730
 less by people who do not have the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 little joystick as being a little bit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.550
 the substitute is actually in this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.380
 video i will offer you a little bit 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 the difference between these two years for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 to know if the fact that you do not have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 the object john steed but you have the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.429
 carbon for example will you impacted so much 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 that in the gameplay is what 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.090
 steed oxygen is really so much better 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.680
 that's what she's so good at 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 what we say we'll see that all 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.899
 right now 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 so the first thing I'm going to you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 talk about features like 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 usually at the beginning i'm going to do a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 small quick comparison but you're going 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.160
 see that I will go very very fast 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.719
 in the details see in the properties 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.829
 in the details really so you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.000
 do not be surprised if you really see 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.890
 a lot of numbers things like that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 do not worry i will tell you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 all this after that then let's start 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.199
 right away by the features 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 basic weapons then obsidian 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 steed at the damage level will make thirty 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 four 34 25 while the carbon will do 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.309
 34 33 25 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.480
 what will change quite the deal 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.650
 since in the end this little point of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.450
 damage will allow loeb said john 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.979
 steed of killing three bullets at average 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.680
 distance while the carbon she does 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.360
 can not because of his 33 the cadence 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 as for her of course on the big 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 game steed and decrease to be 600 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 balls per minute on the first five 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 bullets then 750 thereafter while 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.890
 the carbon will be at 666 out of the five 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.049
 first balls then 857 thereafter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.580
 of course balusters a bonus of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 scope for the obsidian small bonus of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.640
 cadence for the carbon of mans I 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.770
 should say carbon penalty for the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.310
 big n cadence malus for the president 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.200
 yann steed 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 it's true that one in the other can 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.740
 to compensate oneself we will see later that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.579
 that's not quite the case 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 then at the level of accuracy at 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.390
 judged nine young steed at 10% of 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.149
 clarification to the judge and less but by 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.770
 against her at 10% also time for 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 aim in less so that is to say that the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 difference between these two weapons for these 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.390
 two features that makes that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.770
 the ideal object steed draws less quickly and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.060
 you will want to aim more often 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.350
 since it's a bonus of time to aim 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.850
 while carbon as she pulls 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.229
 the faster you will want to make 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.729
 judge shot and a little bit more often 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.110
 since it will be more efficient so one 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.670
 in the other these two characteristics 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.049
 and represents very well what both 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 weapons are supposed to do so I'm not going 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.840
 really talk about it more than that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.930
 really it's really falling down 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.660
 hair in the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.700
 in each specificity of disarmament by 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 against what will be interesting it is 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 a bit of compare wearing them to kill 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.260
 in three bullets of these two weapons like 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.750
 I told you just now 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.980
 finally bring the big and steel arms 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.300
 to a damage bonus so what goes 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.860
 increase the distance she is going 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.440
 able to kill in three bullets and this 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.860
 distance they increased by 2.5 m for the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.450
 carbon at 35 meters for loaded and steel 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.400
 so for killing three balls you go 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.900
 you are really very far away with the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760
 president jan steen it's really a 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 weapon that kill extremely far in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 three brooms that is extremely 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 effective but you also need to know 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.260
 that of course balbyniennes steed 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.510
 arrives with a cadence penalty then 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.709
 is the pace penalty going 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.940
 just not a problem at the level 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.739
 of these bullies three bullets for 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.730
 precisely at the level of carbon is this 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.290
 that carbon will succeed in putting 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.030
 four balls before the little john steed 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.650
 succeeding m 3 it's a little bit the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.209
 question since if it has carbon in may 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.680
 four fronts local obsidian ch'ti 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.650
 to put three where carbon will be 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.380
 best in the matter it's basically the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.970
 time to kill between the 5 and takes 2.5 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.300
 m since we know that the carbon of all 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.549
 way will be better under 5 meters and 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.720
 will be better above 35 meters 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.920
 considering that anyway they have 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.840
 exactly the same damage to these 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.220
 places the only difference is that c 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.290
 that the tea dance kids will be better 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.880
 between 5 and 30.5 m and that's really it 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.810
 the big difference q that's where you 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.120
 go meet the most enemies 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 clearly then the times to kill 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.670
 between 5 and 35 meters will be for the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.110
 carbon of 270 milliseconds then 210 and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.330
 for the little diane steed of 200 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.010
 milliseconds powerful 60 milliseconds 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.840
 so that's right you'll say 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.060
 it's going to sell a lot in the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.130
 details but then we realize that 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.870
 final if I transform myself that a little in 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.290
 percentage that president yann steed 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.750
 about 25% of time to kill in 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 less than carbon c1 because you will put 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.450
 a quarter of a time to kill in less 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.489
 with the Brazilian steed that with the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.380
 carbon in this in this door and there 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.720
 between 5 and 35 meters which is really 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.920
 it's monstrous 1 25% to kill in 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.120
 the less it's really monstrous and it's 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.549
 that makes the big difference between 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.959
 the country house and unfortunately 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.250
 for carbon that's what will kill her 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.579
 that's clearly what will kill her 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.380
 since in addition I add over if 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.180
 you remember well the rates the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.930
 cadences for the big and steve of 6 years 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.709
 and for the 666 666 carbon it's not 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.479
 very well it does not stick to 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.600
 to the freeride of the game if you are on 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.949
 console at 60fps the carbon will shoot 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.630
 as fast as oxygen steed 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.340
 clearly the carbon goes down 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.960
 from 666 to 6 years old so you go 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.630
 strictly nothing see see no 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.039
 difference and at the level of the case of the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.030
 second rate so that when you 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.639
 let's pull the trigger for 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.250
 for more than five balls balanov 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.160
 identity is at 750 and carbon at 857 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.009
 then the 758 will go down to 720 with the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.169
 rounded game engine and carbon 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.060
 she will go from 800 to 57 57 ah I will you 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.520
 let guess September so in the end 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.990
 if I take it all the 2 1 for 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.970
 to have exactly the same pace so 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.410
 on consoles clearly the brigade so 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.030
 much better parts on 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.410
 consoles since the times will kill 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.789
 that I told you just now do not 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.229
 not apply on console clearly 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.849
 so you may have some 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.710
 slight differences depending on 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.729
 framerate of the game of variations on 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.349
 your console you're going to have some 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.729
 slight differences but it's not going to be 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.870
 enough to make carbon a 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.030
 better weapon than little john steed 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.919
 it is clear and net on pc is 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.300
 slightly different Thursday slightly 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.069
 because the western cider is when 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.569
 even better but it's still 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.800
 very slightly different from the carbon 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.150
 still manages to trace a small 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.349
 little slope not enough to be at 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.970
 level of obsidian steen but if you 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.830
 did not miss said diane on pc the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.090
 carbon remains very good but clearly 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.770
 on console if you have the little guy 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.849
 do not stay at night 1 it's clearly 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.750
 day and night and that's why I 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.789
 think a lot of their consoles 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.289
 finds the oxygen really excellent and 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.699
 it's mainly because it decreases in 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.479
 done because the other variants are 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.560
 diminished it's not because 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.940
 the oxygen to increase is because 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.070
 the base the other variants of the ball 27 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.180
 are diminished so here on this I hope 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.440
 that this video will have you more than you 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.880
 will have learned things the wounded there 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.960
 above as usual wish you 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.190
 a good day and a good evening 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.940
 we'll meet again next time 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.940
 go ciao
