here from rcnightmare.com today we're
going<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.310> show<00:00:22.400> you<00:00:22.430> how<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:23.710> replace<00:00:24.710> a

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
going to show you how to replace a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.380 
going to show you how to replace a
steering<00:00:25.970> servo<00:00:26.300> on<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:26.779> HPI<00:00:27.230> blitz<00:00:28.150> so<00:00:29.150> what

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
steering servo on the HPI blitz so what

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.150 
steering servo on the HPI blitz so what
we<00:00:29.480> have<00:00:29.630> in<00:00:29.869> front<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.110> us<00:00:30.230> our<00:00:30.470> front<00:00:30.980> of<00:00:31.040> me

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
we have in front of us our front of me

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.940 
we have in front of us our front of me
here<00:00:31.400> is<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.700> HPI<00:00:32.150> blitz<00:00:32.470> truck<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.739> top

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
here is the HPI blitz truck with the top

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.049 
here is the HPI blitz truck with the top
off<00:00:34.450> everything<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.980> what<00:00:37.760> I've<00:00:37.850> done

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
off everything and what I've done

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.240 
off everything and what I've done
already<00:00:38.239> is<00:00:38.510> I've<00:00:38.750> taken<00:00:39.020> off<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.680> servo<00:00:40.070> and

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
already is I've taken off the servo and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.820 
already is I've taken off the servo and
kind<00:00:40.580> of<00:00:40.610> loosen<00:00:41.000> up<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.270> screws<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:42.710> is

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
kind of loosen up the screws this is

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.229 
kind of loosen up the screws this is
just<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.040> demonstration<00:00:43.220> so<00:00:43.790> I'm<00:00:43.850> not<00:00:43.940> gonna<00:00:44.059> be

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
just a demonstration so I'm not gonna be

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.229 
just a demonstration so I'm not gonna be
replacing<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:44.840> with<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.530> different<00:00:46.040> servo<00:00:46.580> but

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
replacing it with a different servo but

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.510 
replacing it with a different servo but
normally<00:00:47.629> you'd<00:00:47.840> want<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.260> get<00:00:48.920> one<00:00:49.100> with<00:00:49.280> more

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
normally you'd want to get one with more

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.009 
normally you'd want to get one with more
torque<00:00:49.879> than<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.270> stock<00:00:50.629> one

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
torque than the stock one

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.850 
torque than the stock one
I'll<00:00:51.080> give<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:51.470> better<00:00:53.290> steering<00:00:54.290> throw<00:00:54.589> more

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
I'll give you better steering throw more

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.149 
I'll give you better steering throw more
power<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:57.589> let's<00:00:57.830> go<00:00:57.949> ahead<00:00:58.190> do<00:00:58.519> this<00:00:58.699> here

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
power so let's go ahead do this here

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.710 
power so let's go ahead do this here
where's<00:01:01.159> my<00:01:01.400> screwdriver<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:04.479> this<00:01:05.479> steering

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
where's my screwdriver so this steering

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.290 
where's my screwdriver so this steering
servo<00:01:06.140> came<00:01:06.380> out<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.620> here<00:01:06.950> right<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
servo came out of here right and the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.380 
servo came out of here right and the
reason<00:01:08.600> I've<00:01:08.720> left<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:10.400> its<00:01:10.790> mount<00:01:11.090> here

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
reason I've left this on its mount here

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.050 
reason I've left this on its mount here
is<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:11.840> kind<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.229> save<00:01:12.500> time<00:01:13.000> because<00:01:14.000> I

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
is just kind of save time because I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.969 
is just kind of save time because I
didn't<00:01:14.240> want<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.049> see<00:01:15.350> me<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.860> know

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
didn't want you to see me just you know

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.370 
didn't want you to see me just you know
screwing<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.270> here<00:01:17.479> not<00:01:17.990> gonna<00:01:18.200> make

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
screwing this on here not gonna make

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.399 
screwing this on here not gonna make
much<00:01:18.560> sense<00:01:18.760> but<00:01:19.960> you're<00:01:20.960> gonna<00:01:21.049> have<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.260> use

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
much sense but you're gonna have to use

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.620 
much sense but you're gonna have to use
your<00:01:21.560> imagination<00:01:21.620> then<00:01:22.369> because<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.299> mount

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
your imagination then because this mount

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.660 
your imagination then because this mount
just<00:01:23.930> goes<00:01:24.079> across<00:01:24.320> there<00:01:24.740> imagine<00:01:25.610> it

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
just goes across there imagine it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.980 
just goes across there imagine it
without<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.060> servo<00:01:26.299> that's<00:01:26.630> where<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.869> would

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
without the servo that's where it would

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.600 
without the servo that's where it would
go<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.409> even<00:01:27.890> with<00:01:28.100> their<00:01:28.250> several<00:01:28.490> that's

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
go and even with their several that's

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.859 
go and even with their several that's
where<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:28.880> would<00:01:28.939> go<00:01:30.969> so<00:01:31.969> first<00:01:32.509> thing<00:01:32.659> we<00:01:32.750> do

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
where it would go so first thing we do

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.510 
where it would go so first thing we do
is<00:01:33.079> we<00:01:33.549> put<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.090> four<00:01:35.359> bolt<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:35.990> washer<00:01:36.520> if

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
is we put the four bolt and washer if

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.029 
is we put the four bolt and washer if
you<00:01:37.640> can<00:01:37.789> see<00:01:38.030> here<00:01:38.500> underneath<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.710> bolts<00:01:39.979> I

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
you can see here underneath the bolts I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.499 
you can see here underneath the bolts I
have<00:01:40.189> these<00:01:40.579> little<00:01:40.820> metal<00:01:40.969> washers<00:01:41.479> that

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
have these little metal washers that

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.520 
have these little metal washers that
came<00:01:41.869> with<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.109> truck<00:01:42.520> put<00:01:43.520> them<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:44.530> just

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
came with the truck put them on and just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.660 
came with the truck put them on and just
loosely<00:01:46.100> put<00:01:46.280> them<00:01:46.430> on<00:01:46.579> not<00:01:47.149> completely<00:01:47.750> tight

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
loosely put them on not completely tight

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.940 
loosely put them on not completely tight
because<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.729> need<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.149> seat<00:01:50.509> them<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.590> servo

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
because you need to seat them the servo

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.459 
because you need to seat them the servo
in<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.310> mountain<00:01:52.609> correctly<00:01:52.969> see<00:01:53.149> how<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
in the mountain correctly see how it

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.450 
in the mountain correctly see how it
jiggles<00:01:54.469> back<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:54.829> forth<00:01:55.070> they're<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> little

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
jiggles back and forth they're a little

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.359 
jiggles back and forth they're a little
bit<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:56.049> what<00:01:57.049> you<00:01:57.079> can<00:01:57.679> do<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.039> flip

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
bit like that what you can do is flip

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.700 
bit like that what you can do is flip
the<00:01:58.549> truck<00:01:58.759> upside<00:01:58.969> down<00:01:59.359> and<00:01:59.630> use<00:02:00.469> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the truck upside down and use the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.550 
the truck upside down and use the
existing<00:02:01.039> mounting<00:02:01.460> post<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.780> bottom<00:02:03.409> is

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
existing mounting post the bottom is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.230 
existing mounting post the bottom is
flat<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.600> nubs<00:02:06.079> on<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.499> mount<00:02:06.969> will<00:02:07.969> fit

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
flat and the nubs on the mount will fit

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.110 
flat and the nubs on the mount will fit
into<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:10.130> use<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.910> make

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
into that and you can use that to make

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.530 
into that and you can use that to make
sure<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.780> servo<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.320> lined<00:02:12.680> up

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
sure that the servo is lined up

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.970 
sure that the servo is lined up
perfectly<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> mount<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
perfectly on the mount so with it in the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.720 
perfectly on the mount so with it in the
slot<00:02:18.980> there<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:20.840> go<00:02:21.020> ahead<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.530> tighten<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
slot there just go ahead and tighten the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.440 
slot there just go ahead and tighten the
four<00:02:23.030> mounting<00:02:23.540> screws<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:25.180> stagger<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
four mounting screws here I stagger the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.380 
four mounting screws here I stagger the
screws<00:02:27.190> star-shape<00:02:28.190> or<00:02:28.460> what-have-you<00:02:28.700> just

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
screws star-shape or what-have-you just

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.340 
screws star-shape or what-have-you just
so<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.930> lines<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.410> even

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so that it lines up even

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.370 
so that it lines up even
just<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.020> tight

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
just like that so now that it's tight

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.870 
just like that so now that it's tight
you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.950> flip<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> truck<00:02:35.550> around<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:37.880> this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
you can flip the truck around and this

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.060 
you can flip the truck around and this
is<00:02:39.000> dry<00:02:39.180> fit<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.570> make<00:02:39.810> sure<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.560> still

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
is dry fit it make sure that it still

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.420 
is dry fit it make sure that it still
fits

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
fits

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.850 
fits
yeah<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.940> nothing<00:02:42.570> unexpected<00:02:42.770> though<00:02:43.770> it's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
yeah so nothing unexpected though it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.320 
yeah so nothing unexpected though it's
kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.280> neat<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.180> just

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
kind of really neat that you can just

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.150 
kind of really neat that you can just
flip<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.630> upside<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.140> use<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> as<00:02:47.130> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
flip it upside down and use it as a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.510 
flip it upside down and use it as a
guide<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:48.290> seat<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.530> servo<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.250> mount

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
guide to seat the servo in the mount

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.540 
guide to seat the servo in the mount
here<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.800> point<00:02:53.010> we're<00:02:53.190> ready<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
here so at this point we're ready to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.080 
here so at this point we're ready to
actually<00:02:53.730> install<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.690> servo<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:56.090> but

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
actually install the servo in here but

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.200 
actually install the servo in here but
first<00:02:57.390> thing<00:02:57.570> we're<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> need<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.320> is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.860 

looking<00:03:03.210> for<00:03:03.390> my<00:03:03.510> screw<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:05.690> install<00:03:06.690> this

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
looking for my screw here install this

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.630 
looking for my screw here install this
servo<00:03:07.170> horn<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> servo<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.740> that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.290 

don't<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.720> install<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.380> on<00:03:17.120> putting<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
don't just install it on putting it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.940 
don't just install it on putting it
arbitrarily<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.140> like<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.770> it's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
arbitrarily on like this because it's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.790 
arbitrarily on like this because it's
not<00:03:20.130> centered<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.600> should<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.170> Center<00:03:22.620> your

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
not centered we should do is Center your

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.130 
not centered we should do is Center your
servo<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.460> way<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.240> plug<00:03:24.990> in

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
servo and the way to do that is plug in

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.330 
servo and the way to do that is plug in
your<00:03:27.620> servo<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.950> receiver<00:03:29.370> here<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
your servo to the receiver here and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.100 
your servo to the receiver here and
power<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.700> truck<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.600> demonstration

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
power on the truck for demonstration

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.940 
power on the truck for demonstration
purposes

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
purposes

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.180 
purposes
this<00:03:35.400> isn't<00:03:35.700> powered<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.650> plug<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.830> battery

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
this isn't powered but plug in a battery

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.210 
this isn't powered but plug in a battery
turn<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.270> your<00:03:39.740> transmitter<00:03:40.740> make<00:03:41.100> sure

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
turn it on on your transmitter make sure

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.740 
turn it on on your transmitter make sure
that<00:03:41.460> your<00:03:41.820> steering<00:03:42.210> trim<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.920> centered<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
that your steering trim is centered and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.810 
that your steering trim is centered and
with<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.140> your<00:03:46.650> your<00:03:47.010> servo<00:03:47.340> will<00:03:47.520> Center

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
with this on your your servo will Center

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.440 
with this on your your servo will Center
itself<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.050> do<00:03:49.260> then<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:50.270> put<00:03:51.270> this

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
itself what you can do then is put this

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.970 
itself what you can do then is put this
on<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:51.720> now<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:51.990> know<00:03:52.140> where<00:03:52.440> Center<00:03:52.800> is

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
on because now you know where Center is

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.100 
on because now you know where Center is
right<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.820> way<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> install<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.660> here<00:03:54.930> is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
right the way to install this on here is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.650 
right the way to install this on here is
the<00:03:56.070> silver<00:03:56.310> horn<00:03:56.550> goes<00:03:56.730> perpendicular<00:03:57.000> to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
the silver horn goes perpendicular to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.150 
the silver horn goes perpendicular to
the<00:03:59.120> servo<00:04:00.120> mount<00:04:00.360> here<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.320> use<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:02.010> as<00:04:02.130> your

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the servo mount here so use that as your

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.810 
the servo mount here so use that as your
plane<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.970> then<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.720> want<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.050> do

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
plane and then we just want to do

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.970 
plane and then we just want to do
perpendicular<00:04:05.820> it's<00:04:06.000> never<00:04:06.660> going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.080> 90

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
perpendicular it's never going to be 90

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.370 
perpendicular it's never going to be 90
degrees<00:04:08.280> exactly<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> think<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.020> manual

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
degrees exactly but I think the manual

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.050 
degrees exactly but I think the manual
says<00:04:10.590> within<00:04:10.920> eight<00:04:11.340> degrees<00:04:11.790> or<00:04:11.970> something

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
says within eight degrees or something

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.860 
says within eight degrees or something
like<00:04:12.270> that<00:04:12.360> is<00:04:12.660> alright<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.700> I'm<00:04:15.600> just<00:04:15.780> gonna

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
like that is alright so I'm just gonna

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.450 
like that is alright so I'm just gonna
go<00:04:16.200> ahead<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:18.650> whoops<00:04:19.650> wrong<00:04:20.100> screw<00:04:20.430> driver

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
go ahead and whoops wrong screw driver

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.460 
go ahead and whoops wrong screw driver
put<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:26.240> screw<00:04:27.240> into<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:27.780> servo<00:04:28.080> horn<00:04:28.230> here

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
put this screw into this servo horn here

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.390 
put this screw into this servo horn here
to<00:04:29.000> install<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.270> place<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:34.130> we're<00:04:35.130> pretty

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
to install it in place so we're pretty

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.980 
to install it in place so we're pretty
much<00:04:35.610> close<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.150> end<00:04:36.450> here<00:04:36.600> there<00:04:36.840> isn't

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
much close to the end here there isn't

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.330 
much close to the end here there isn't
much<00:04:37.260> left

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
much left

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.850 
much left
once<00:04:38.820> I've<00:04:39.000> been<00:04:39.350> installed<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.530> with<00:04:40.740> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
once I've been installed that with the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.760 
once I've been installed that with the
screw<00:04:41.310> there<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.820> can<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:42.330> place<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:43.110> servo

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
screw there I can just place the servo

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.659 
screw there I can just place the servo
into

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
into

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.399 
into
it's<00:04:45.139> cavity<00:04:46.139> here<00:04:46.349> on<00:04:46.469> the<00:04:46.560> chassis<00:04:47.870> into<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
it's cavity here on the chassis into the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.790 
it's cavity here on the chassis into the
mounting<00:04:49.830> holes<00:04:50.039> two<00:04:50.819> screws<00:04:51.120> go<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.509> only<00:04:52.379> two

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
mounting holes two screws go on only two

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.920 
mounting holes two screws go on only two
screws<00:04:53.009> hold<00:04:53.460> them<00:04:53.729> servo<00:04:54.330> mount<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
screws hold them servo mount to the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.050 
screws hold them servo mount to the
chassis<00:04:55.169> here<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:55.889> it's<00:04:56.430> going<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.759> be<00:04:56.849> pretty

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
chassis here so it's going to be pretty

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.309 
chassis here so it's going to be pretty
straightforward<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.659> going<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.020> make<00:04:58.199> sure

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
straightforward just going to make sure

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.529 
straightforward just going to make sure
that<00:04:58.529> there's<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.219> linkage<00:04:59.819> up<00:05:00.029> here<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.330> out<00:05:00.509> of

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
that there's a linkage up here is out of

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.779 
that there's a linkage up here is out of
the<00:05:00.689> way<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.860> just<00:05:02.219> like<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:04.279> now<00:05:05.279> it's

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
the way so just like that and now it's

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.790 
the way so just like that and now it's
straight<00:05:06.120> forward<00:05:06.979> two<00:05:07.979> screws<00:05:08.340> down<00:05:09.800> one

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
straight forward two screws down one

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:22.129 
straight forward two screws down one
down<00:05:11.249> another<00:05:11.729> one<00:05:11.819> to<00:05:12.060> go<00:05:12.180> here<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:21.139> that's

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
down another one to go here so that's

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.959 
down another one to go here so that's
that<00:05:22.620> now<00:05:24.409> all<00:05:25.409> we<00:05:25.529> have<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.740> do<00:05:25.860> is<00:05:25.979> attach

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
that now all we have to do is attach

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.429 
that now all we have to do is attach
this<00:05:27.180> ball<00:05:27.419> cup<00:05:27.800> on<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.370> our<00:05:29.520> server<00:05:29.789> horn<00:05:30.180> and

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
this ball cup on to our server horn and

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.749 
this ball cup on to our server horn and
the<00:05:31.439> only<00:05:31.590> real<00:05:31.860> way<00:05:32.009> to<00:05:32.039> do<00:05:32.279> this<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.580> with

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
the only real way to do this is with

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.409 
the only real way to do this is with
some<00:05:32.939> needle<00:05:33.150> nose<00:05:35.509> so<00:05:36.680> let's<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:38.300> it's<00:05:39.300> gonna
