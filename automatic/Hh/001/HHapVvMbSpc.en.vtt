just see where it's going I mean I would

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
just see where it's going I mean I would
imagine<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.390> will<00:01:00.510> continue<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> sort<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
imagine it will continue on the sort of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
imagine it will continue on the sort of
trajectory<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.370> been<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.699> where<00:01:02.940> dr.

venture<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.229> gotten<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.530> little

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
venture has actually gotten a little

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.960 
venture has actually gotten a little
more<00:01:05.510> humanized<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.310> emotionally<00:01:08.310> nuanced

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
more humanized and emotionally nuanced

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
more humanized and emotionally nuanced
in<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.330> season<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> season<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.030> sure

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
in a way season to season so I'm sure

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
in a way season to season so I'm sure
that<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.540> continue<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.080> happen<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.619> he's<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
that will continue to happen it's he's a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.910 
that will continue to happen it's he's a
difficult<00:01:15.180> character<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.770> like

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
difficult character and it's not like

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
difficult character and it's not like
he's<00:01:17.189> necessarily<00:01:17.549> become<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.509> sympathetic

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
he's necessarily become more sympathetic

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
he's necessarily become more sympathetic
it's<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> they've<00:01:20.150> done<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> little

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's just that they've done a little

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's just that they've done a little
more<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> sort<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.380> show<00:01:22.439> where<00:01:22.979> he's<00:01:23.220> coming

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
more to sort of show where he's coming

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.190 
more to sort of show where he's coming
from<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.330> sort<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.049> childhood<00:01:25.530> wounds<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
from a sort of childhood wounds and I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
from a sort of childhood wounds and I
get<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> cartoon<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.009> he's<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.369> like

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
get to cartoon but he's actually like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
get to cartoon but he's actually like
all<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> characters<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.720> sort<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
all the characters are really sort of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.539 
all the characters are really sort of
nuanced<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.990> detailed<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.520> on

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
nuanced in and detailed as as we go on

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.440 
nuanced in and detailed as as we go on
so<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.640> every<00:01:39.060> year

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so you know and that's it's every year

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
so you know and that's it's every year
when<00:01:39.570> i<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.869> scripts<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.320> each<00:01:40.439> new<00:01:40.680> season

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
when i get scripts for each new season

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.620 
when i get scripts for each new season
it<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.280> gets<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.030> interesting

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it just gets more and more interesting

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.770 
it just gets more and more interesting
and<00:01:42.829> expansive<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:45.000> imagine<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and expansive so i would imagine it that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
and expansive so i would imagine it that
will<00:01:45.930> continue<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.470> happen<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.670> year

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
will continue to happen and this year

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
will continue to happen and this year
