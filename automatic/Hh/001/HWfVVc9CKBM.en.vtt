00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.230
 for the demonstration genius the bar in 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.280
 static mode to be able to well you 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 show each of the movements 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.980
 so we start by going up normally 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.580
 once you are at the top you 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.440
 hang in chair and my me I you 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.170
 advise to stretch the legs for not 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.720
 take too much speed before being 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.430
 in the figure so once you are 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.260
 here in chair you will come hang 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.650
 the bar just above your head 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.370
 here be like that or be like that like 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.930
 what you prefer 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.870
 I personally prefer it like that 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.229
 and one with the other arm you go 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.449
 come over the shoulder to hang the 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.879
 tube raissi and once you are there 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.460
 you fold people and hang on 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.560
 people you can put them either 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.659
 tense both sides or be like that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 one next to the other and the head 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.350
 you just place it before the bar 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.530
 like that to really wound you up 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.720
 around the bar once you 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.030
 want to get out of the figure you tend 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.640
 the people you let go of you get the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.320
 bar here 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.960
 this time we will redo it with the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.420
 bar in spinning mode so we start 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.160
 by go up once you are here you 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.980
 go into a chair I hear pure 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.640
 contradicts dess in place the first hand 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.400
 above we will come to pass the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.310
 saddles and we hang the feet in 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.550
 placing the head next to the bar for 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.090
 get out of the face we go back on the head 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.530
 let go of the feet and hear people 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.330
 the baby this text is a figure rather 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.040
 beginners who do not ask a lot of 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.380
 forces from the moment you know 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.780
 to make the chair but against that it can 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.300
 turn very fast so keep well in 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.369
 head only if you go too fast so much 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.789
 of the legs and you will lose from 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.720
 speed 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.720
 There you go
