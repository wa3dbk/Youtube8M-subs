my<00:00:24.060> backers<00:00:24.510> right<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.529> decided<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
my backers right now so I decided to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650 
my backers right now so I decided to
launch<00:00:26.099> my<00:00:26.279> second<00:00:26.670> project<00:00:27.060> based<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
launch my second project based on the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
launch my second project based on the
same<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.680> taking<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.099> normal<00:00:29.279> everyday

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
same thing of taking a normal everyday

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
same thing of taking a normal everyday
object<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:30.599> usually<00:00:31.019> made<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> paper

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
object that's usually made out of paper

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.660 
object that's usually made out of paper
or<00:00:31.949> plastic<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:33.739> changing<00:00:34.739> its<00:00:34.860> material<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
or plastic and changing its material to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
or plastic and changing its material to
make<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.969> even<00:00:36.180> more<00:00:36.329> durable<00:00:36.750> even<00:00:36.899> more

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
make it even more durable even more

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
make it even more durable even more
beautiful<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> chose<00:00:38.610> carbon<00:00:39.030> fiber<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
beautiful and so I chose carbon fiber I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.360 
beautiful and so I chose carbon fiber I
wasn't<00:00:39.899> able<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> find<00:00:40.350> any<00:00:40.590> text<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.129> there

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
wasn't able to find any text out there

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.520 
wasn't able to find any text out there
made<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.329> carbon<00:00:42.660> fiber<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> few

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
made from carbon fiber there are a few

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
made from carbon fiber there are a few
made<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> wood<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.309> stainless<00:00:44.670> steel<00:00:44.940> but

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
made out of wood or stainless steel but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.650 
made out of wood or stainless steel but
I<00:00:45.860> just<00:00:46.860> couldn't<00:00:47.160> find<00:00:47.280> any<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> contacted

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I just couldn't find any so I contacted

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.369 
I just couldn't find any so I contacted
a<00:00:48.750> manufacturer<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:50.190> carbon<00:00:50.610> fiber<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> they

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
a manufacturer of carbon fiber and they

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.970 
a manufacturer of carbon fiber and they
cut<00:00:52.590> me<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:53.270> these<00:00:54.270> cards<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.739> able<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
cut me out these cards and I was able to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540 
cut me out these cards and I was able to
silkscreen<00:00:57.530> card<00:00:58.530> images<00:00:58.859> onto<00:00:59.190> them<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
silkscreen card images onto them and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.770 
silkscreen card images onto them and
they<00:00:59.730> turned<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.120> beautifully

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they turned out beautifully

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
they turned out beautifully
they're<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.100> thick<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.180> thin<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.890> regular

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
they're just as thick or thin as regular

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.289 
they're just as thick or thin as regular
playing<00:01:05.610> cards<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.470> because<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> its<00:01:07.770> unique

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
playing cards but because of its unique

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
playing cards but because of its unique
carbon<00:01:09.299> fibers<00:01:09.570> unique<00:01:09.869> properties<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> being

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
carbon fibers unique properties of being

regular<00:01:15.990> playing<00:01:16.229> cards<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> lot

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
regular playing cards but are a lot

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
regular playing cards but are a lot

stronger and a lot more durable they are

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
stronger and a lot more durable they are
rip<00:01:20.700> resistant<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.909> could<00:01:23.909> possibly<00:01:24.330> rip<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
rip resistant I could possibly rip that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.219 
rip resistant I could possibly rip that
if<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.080> tried<00:01:26.040> harder<00:01:26.689> but<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.080> going

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
if I tried harder but you're not going

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.069 
if I tried harder but you're not going
to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.380> able<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.560> rip<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.920> by<00:01:29.130> accident<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
to be able to rip these by accident and

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
to be able to rip these by accident and
yet<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.320> still<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:33.229> flexible<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:35.549> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
yet they still are flexible that can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
yet they still are flexible that can
touch<00:01:36.689> them<00:01:36.930> tip<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> tip<00:01:38.090> carbon<00:01:39.090> fiber<00:01:39.299> is

touch them tip to tip carbon fiber is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.490 
touch them tip to tip carbon fiber is
strong<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> sometimes

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
strong but because of that sometimes

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.590 
strong but because of that sometimes
strong<00:01:43.500> materials<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> brittle

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
strong materials can have a brittle

failure carbon fiber is a composite

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230 
failure carbon fiber is a composite
material<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.920> both<00:01:50.520> features<00:01:50.970> that's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
material so it has both features that's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
material so it has both features that's
strong<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> flexible<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.770> beyond

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
strong and flexible but if you go beyond

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819 
strong and flexible but if you go beyond
a<00:01:53.250> certain<00:01:53.280> point<00:01:53.960> if<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.470> clamp

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
a certain point if I was to really clamp

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.830 
a certain point if I was to really clamp
down<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:57.030> part<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> card<00:01:57.630> right<00:01:57.810> now

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.209 
down on this part of the card right now
I<00:01:58.310> could<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.939> snap<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.420> half<00:02:01.159> but<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I could get this to snap in half but you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
I could get this to snap in half but you
really<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.000> try<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
really have to try you really have to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
really have to try you really have to
put<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.200> pressure<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.950> they're

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
put a lot of pressure on them so they're

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130 
put a lot of pressure on them so they're
not<00:02:05.189> indestructible<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.780> they're<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> lot

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
not indestructible but they're a lot

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.279 
not indestructible but they're a lot
more<00:02:07.200> durable<00:02:07.590> than<00:02:08.099> your<00:02:08.160> average<00:02:09.080> paper<00:02:10.080> or

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
more durable than your average paper or

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.800 
more durable than your average paper or
plastic<00:02:10.410> playing<00:02:10.979> cards

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
plastic playing cards

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
plastic playing cards
so<00:02:12.810> let<00:02:12.960> me<00:02:13.400> get<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> rest<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.880> deck<00:02:15.090> out

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
so let me get the rest of the deck out

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.770 
so let me get the rest of the deck out
here<00:02:15.570> there<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> lot<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.360> repeats<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.540> here

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
here there are a lot of repeats in here

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.070 
here there are a lot of repeats in here
because<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.970> tooling<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.390> silk-screening

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
because the tooling for silk-screening

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.710 
because the tooling for silk-screening
is<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.950> expensive<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.210> got<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> few

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
is is expensive and so I only got a few

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.080 
is is expensive and so I only got a few
of<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> card<00:02:25.140> images<00:02:25.640> silk-screened<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.790> here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
of the card images silk-screened on here

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.360 
of the card images silk-screened on here
upon<00:02:27.900> completion<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> project<00:02:28.740> out<00:02:29.130> for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
upon completion of the project out for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850 
upon completion of the project out for
just<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> rest<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> silk<00:02:30.240> screens<00:02:30.710> if<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
just the rest of the silk screens if the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.670 
just the rest of the silk screens if the
project<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.280> funded<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.230> have<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> complete

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
project is funded and have a complete

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520 
project is funded and have a complete
deck<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:36.270> beware<00:02:36.900> there's<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
deck but beware there's going to be a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.750 
deck but beware there's going to be a
lot<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:38.000> repeats<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.700> these<00:02:41.700> are

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
lot of a repeats in here so these are

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.190 
lot of a repeats in here so these are
the<00:02:42.950> matte<00:02:43.950> cards<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.690> hearts<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the matte cards the the hearts and the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.220 
the matte cards the the hearts and the
diamonds<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.310> cork<00:02:47.550> cards<00:02:47.730> will<00:02:48.060> be<00:02:48.270> printed

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
diamonds the cork cards will be printed

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
diamonds the cork cards will be printed
in<00:02:49.440> white<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:51.210> red<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.880> spades<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
in white and red and the spades and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.810 
in white and red and the spades and
clubs<00:02:54.410> will<00:02:55.410> be<00:02:55.530> printed<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.310> white<00:02:56.490> so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
clubs will be printed in just white so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.150 
clubs will be printed in just white so
this<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.510> matte<00:02:57.750> finish<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:59.490> this<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.660> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
this is the matte finish and this is the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.630 
this is the matte finish and this is the
gloss<00:03:02.160> finish<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.240> back<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:06.840> are

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
gloss finish and in the back here are

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.990 
gloss finish and in the back here are
the<00:03:08.640> stretch<00:03:09.210> goals<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.730> carbon<00:03:11.730> fiber

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the stretch goals this is a carbon fiber

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.570 
the stretch goals this is a carbon fiber
but<00:03:12.540> they've<00:03:13.140> taken<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.130> step<00:03:14.160> further

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
but they've taken it one step further

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.730 
but they've taken it one step further
and<00:03:14.810> woven<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.230> blue<00:03:16.950> or<00:03:17.280> red<00:03:17.880> thread<00:03:18.450> and

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
and woven in a blue or red thread and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.280 
and woven in a blue or red thread and
silver<00:03:19.740> thread<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.160> each<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.460> these<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:21.510> give

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
silver thread and each of these to give

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.610 
silver thread and each of these to give
them<00:03:23.420> more<00:03:24.420> unique<00:03:24.690> properties<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
them more unique properties and just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.190 
them more unique properties and just
have<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.280> light<00:03:26.460> play<00:03:26.700> off<00:03:26.850> them<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.300> just

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
have the light play off them and just

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.510 
have the light play off them and just
make<00:03:28.230> them<00:03:28.500> even<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:28.830> much<00:03:28.920> more<00:03:28.980> beautiful

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
make them even that much more beautiful

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.830 
make them even that much more beautiful
so<00:03:30.300> this<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.570> blue<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:33.180> red<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> back

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
so this is blue and the red on the back

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.360 
so this is blue and the red on the back
here<00:03:34.110> so<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.900> my<00:03:37.530> project<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.160> need

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
here so this is my project and I need

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.990 
here so this is my project and I need
your<00:03:38.520> help
