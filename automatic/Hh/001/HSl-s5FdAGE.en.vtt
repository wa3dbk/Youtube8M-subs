when I was in my car and then I forgot

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.800 
when I was in my car and then I forgot
all<00:04:25.340> about<00:04:25.400> them<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.210> is<00:04:26.360> where<00:04:26.540> they<00:04:26.630> are

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
all about them so this is where they are

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.590 
all about them so this is where they are
I'm<00:04:27.410> gonna<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.830> put<00:04:27.980> them<00:04:28.100> away<00:04:28.600> all

right<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.200> think<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.220> concludes<00:04:31.880> it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
right and I think that that concludes it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.410
