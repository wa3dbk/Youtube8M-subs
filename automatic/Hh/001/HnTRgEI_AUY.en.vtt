and we're gonna add that to the mix as
well<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:30.560> look<00:01:30.770> at<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.009> point<00:01:31.310> handle<00:01:31.670> this

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
well you look at this point handle this

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.669 
well you look at this point handle this
I<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.149> running<00:01:32.509> mixture<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.110> will<00:01:33.229> also<00:01:33.560> be

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
I do running mixture it will also be

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:34.300 
I do running mixture it will also be
quite<00:01:33.860> lumpy

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
quite lumpy

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.190 
quite lumpy
it<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:35.000> probably<00:01:35.330> will<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.479> be<00:01:35.750> taking<00:01:35.959> it

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it is probably will just be taking it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.690 
it is probably will just be taking it
out<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.500> microwave<00:01:37.039> melting<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:37.670> down

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
out to the microwave melting it down

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.320 
out to the microwave melting it down
until<00:01:38.360> all<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.630> those<00:01:39.130> Lords<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:40.399> melted<00:01:41.209> in

until all of those Lords have melted in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.160 
until all of those Lords have melted in
and<00:01:41.690> we<00:01:41.869> add<00:01:41.959> a<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.140> smooth<00:01:42.709> and<00:01:43.959> just<00:01:44.959> take

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
and we add a little smooth and just take

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:59.090 
and we add a little smooth and just take
that<00:01:45.319> back<00:01:45.500> across<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.069> microwave

and<00:03:15.150> eventually<00:03:15.660> we<00:03:15.810> end<00:03:15.989> over

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
and eventually we end over

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.020

you<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:19.480> don't<00:03:19.990> worry<00:03:20.170> about<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.830> let's

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
you can don't worry about it and let's

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.620 
you can don't worry about it and let's
take<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.220> back<00:03:21.459> across<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> microwave

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
take it back across to the microwave

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.809 
take it back across to the microwave
area<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.500> grab<00:03:23.740> all<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.920> us<00:03:24.190> through<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.700> one

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
area and grab all of us through this one

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.880 
area and grab all of us through this one
again<00:03:27.819> just<00:03:28.270> scrape<00:03:28.540> off<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.750> excess<00:03:28.900> just

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
again just scrape off the excess just

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.660 
again just scrape off the excess just

pop<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.090> again<00:03:37.540> 10-second<00:03:38.320> intervals<00:03:38.650> is

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
pop it in again 10-second intervals is

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.280 
pop it in again 10-second intervals is
to<00:03:39.100> ensure<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.850> mix<00:03:40.060> doesn't

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.350 

we<00:03:47.769> will<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.099> take<00:03:48.459> our<00:03:48.640> mixture<00:03:48.819> back<00:03:49.150> out

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
we will just take our mixture back out

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.589 
we will just take our mixture back out
of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.569> microwave<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:51.420> we've<00:03:52.420> been

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
of the microwave and we've been

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.390 
of the microwave and we've been
constantly<00:03:53.019> putting<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.439> back<00:03:53.590> 10-second

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
constantly putting it back 10-second

constantly putting it back 10-second
intervals<00:03:54.790> at<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> time<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.470> now<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
intervals at a time and now we have a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.369 
intervals at a time and now we have a
lovely<00:03:57.280> runny<00:03:57.670> consistency<00:03:58.260> which<00:03:59.260> is

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
lovely runny consistency which is

lovely runny consistency which is
perfect<00:04:00.099> for<00:04:00.370> our<00:04:00.400> function<00:04:00.790> we're<00:04:01.659> just

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
perfect for our function we're just

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.149 
perfect for our function we're just
going<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.049> again<00:04:02.200> take<00:04:02.260> our<00:04:02.650> mixture<00:04:02.829> back

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
going to again take our mixture back

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.559 
going to again take our mixture back
across<00:04:03.489> here<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.120> we're<00:04:04.209> going<00:04:04.329> to<00:04:04.390> do<00:04:04.540> our

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
across here and we're going to do our

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.589 
across here and we're going to do our
final<00:04:05.079> stage<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.940> take<00:04:07.090> our<00:04:07.299> vanilla

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
final stage this is to take our vanilla

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.600 
final stage this is to take our vanilla

we've<00:04:09.879> got<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> put<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.329> in<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.629> our<00:04:10.659> mixture

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
we've got to put this in to our mixture

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.259 
we've got to put this in to our mixture
ensure<00:04:11.980> when<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.250> put<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.549> vanilla<00:04:12.640> essence

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269
