00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
about this about a year and a half ago

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.620 
about this about a year and a half ago
as<00:00:25.220> more<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.279> more<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:27.090> baby<00:00:27.330> like

guitars<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> market<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
guitars got it in the market and you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.160 
guitars got it in the market and you
really<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.000> something<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
really there was something there and I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.420

the ante a little bit and and and come
back<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> revisit<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.450> whole<00:00:36.660> thing<00:00:36.870> 15

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
back and revisit this whole thing 15

back and revisit this whole thing 15
years<00:00:37.530> later<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.370> about

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
years later with what we know about

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.220 
years later with what we know about
guitar<00:00:39.090> billing<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.629> we've<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.170> we've

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
guitar billing what we've what we've

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.940 
guitar billing what we've what we've
learned<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> last<00:00:41.430> 15<00:00:41.940> years<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
learned about over the last 15 years and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.740 
learned about over the last 15 years and
what<00:00:43.950> came<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.489> being<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> GS

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
what came into being from that is the GS

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.670 
what came into being from that is the GS
mini<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.850> real<00:00:47.850> simply<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.660> thing<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
mini so real simply this thing is that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
mini so real simply this thing is that
much<00:00:49.920> wider<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.850> longer<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
much wider that much longer and that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
much wider that much longer and that
much<00:00:51.780> deeper<00:00:52.140> than<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.350> baby<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
much deeper than a baby but that sort of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
much deeper than a baby but that sort of
makes<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> twice<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.120> big<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.260> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
makes it twice as big so it's it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
makes it twice as big so it's it's
equally<00:00:55.980> portable<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> play<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
equally portable but when you play this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:11.649 
equally portable but when you play this
guitar

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.440 

there's<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.320> real<00:01:12.499> sound<00:01:12.770> there<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:14.270> works

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
there's a real sound there and it works

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.010 
there's a real sound there and it works
really<00:01:14.990> really<00:01:15.200> cool<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.490> other<00:01:16.670> thing<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
really really cool the other thing and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.510 
really really cool the other thing and
you<00:01:18.109> notice<00:01:18.409> you've<00:01:18.530> got<00:01:18.710> some<00:01:18.890> real<00:01:19.069> cool<00:01:19.249> /

you notice you've got some real cool /

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.580 
you notice you've got some real cool /
flings<00:01:19.759> around<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.240> top<00:01:20.450> we've<00:01:20.719> developed

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
flings around the top we've developed

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.760 
flings around the top we've developed
some<00:01:21.770> brand<00:01:22.340> new<00:01:22.569> manufacturing<00:01:23.770> methods

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
some brand new manufacturing methods

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.349 
some brand new manufacturing methods
that<00:01:24.950> allow<00:01:25.069> us<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.579> put<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:25.880> some<00:01:25.909> real

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
that allow us to put in some real

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.179 
that allow us to put in some real
niceties<00:01:26.959> on<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.259> guitar<00:01:27.499> without<00:01:27.740> kind<00:01:28.100> of

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
niceties on the guitar without kind of

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.980 
niceties on the guitar without kind of
blowing<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.549> price<00:01:28.759> out<00:01:28.969> guitars<00:01:29.719> going<00:01:29.840> to

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
blowing the price out guitars going to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.279 
blowing the price out guitars going to
map<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.469> 498<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.539> not<00:01:32.719> too<00:01:32.959> expensive

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
map for 498 so so it's not too expensive

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.919 
map for 498 so so it's not too expensive
now<00:01:33.859> what<00:01:34.039> happens<00:01:34.459> when<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.789> make<00:01:34.969> less

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
now what happens when you make less

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.690 
now what happens when you make less
expensive<00:01:36.590> guitars<00:01:37.009> your<00:01:37.310> American

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
expensive guitars your American

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
expensive guitars your American
manufacturer<00:01:38.479> pickups<00:01:39.289> become<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.649> problem

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
manufacturer pickups become a problem

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.319 
manufacturer pickups become a problem
and<00:01:40.310> we've<00:01:40.549> never<00:01:40.579> been<00:01:40.909> able<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.149> offer

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
and we've never been able to offer

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.449 
and we've never been able to offer
pickups<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.170> babies<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.740> big<00:01:42.859> babies<00:01:43.159> because

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
pickups on babies and big babies because

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.760 
pickups on babies and big babies because
the<00:01:43.609> technology<00:01:44.140> doesn't<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.409> lend

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
the technology doesn't really lend

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.679 
the technology doesn't really lend
itself<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.340> guitar<00:01:46.670> price<00:01:47.090> gets<00:01:47.420> blown<00:01:47.659> out

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
itself the guitar price gets blown out

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.380 
itself the guitar price gets blown out
of<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.020> water<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.189> started<00:01:49.520> toying<00:01:50.149> with

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
of the water so we started toying with

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.249 
of the water so we started toying with
this<00:01:50.569> idea<00:01:50.750> what<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:51.319> we<00:01:51.439> had<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.849> nice<00:01:53.259> magnetic

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
this idea what if we had a nice magnetic

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.469 
this idea what if we had a nice magnetic
sound<00:01:54.500> hole<00:01:54.679> pick<00:01:54.860> up<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.729> idea<00:01:56.090> being<00:01:56.360> that

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
sound hole pick up the idea being that

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.179 
sound hole pick up the idea being that
if<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:56.899> could<00:01:57.079> put<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.349> in<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.530> sound<00:01:57.770> hole<00:01:57.979> but

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
if we could put it in the sound hole but

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.160 
if we could put it in the sound hole but
not<00:01:58.340> let<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.759> ever<00:01:58.909> touch<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.450> sides<00:01:59.719> of<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
not let it ever touch the sides of the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.260 
not let it ever touch the sides of the
sound<00:02:00.409> hole<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:01.129> would<00:02:01.280> kind<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.579> disappear
