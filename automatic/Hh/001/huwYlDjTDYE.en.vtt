that<00:00:53.520> particular<00:00:53.820> recovery<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.050> coming<00:00:55.410> back

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that particular recovery now coming back

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740 
that particular recovery now coming back
to<00:00:55.620> CWM<00:00:56.010> once<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> put<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> recovery

to CWM once you put into a recovery
first<00:00:58.260> step<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> check<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.129> recovery

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
first step is to check your recovery

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
first step is to check your recovery

recovery version 6 dot 0 dot for dot 9

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.590 
recovery version 6 dot 0 dot for dot 9
in<00:01:04.710> order<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> install<00:01:05.400> any<00:01:05.670> kit<00:01:05.970> kat<00:01:06.180> rom<00:01:06.390> you

seconds<00:03:41.570> or<00:03:41.660> more<00:03:41.930> than<00:03:42.110> five<00:03:42.290> seconds<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.710> mean

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
seconds or more than five seconds I mean

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.290 
seconds or more than five seconds I mean
this<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.430> correct<00:03:43.640> way<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.090> how<00:03:44.180> it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
this is the correct way this is how it

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.080 
this is the correct way this is how it
should<00:03:44.450> happen<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.770> again<00:03:46.130> just<00:03:46.400> be<00:03:46.640> patient

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
should happen and again just be patient

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.900 
should happen and again just be patient
it<00:03:47.300> should<00:03:47.690> be<00:03:47.720> over<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.380> another<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:49.459> safe<00:03:49.760> I

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
it should be over in another like safe I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.760 
it should be over in another like safe I
ten<00:03:50.150> seconds<00:03:50.630> we<00:03:50.780> should<00:03:50.959> have<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.440> progress

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770
