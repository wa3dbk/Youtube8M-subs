00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 friends hello my name is Timur and you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.879
 watch a show about mobile photography 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.740
 if you think that all this is not serious 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.050
 Well, photos on the phone, then take a look at 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.849
 here is this photo and what will your 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 surprise if we say that such 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 the photo is completely calm you can 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 do on a regular smartphone today i'm not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 I'll just say that it can be done on 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.480
 I'll show you how you watch the show less 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.480
 five shows about mobile photography 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 This style of photography is called 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 polar panorama and he usually removed 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.470
 several professional from 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 apparatus at the same time but what 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.190
 do we do because we shoot on the usual 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.120
 smartphone whose camera is moreover 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.120
 only 5 megapixels 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.250
 make such a photo to help 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.899
 special applications that allow 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.030
 us shoot our most smartphones 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.009
 real panorama and now talk about 4 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.390
 the best applications in my opinion 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.009
 which are suitable for this first 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.509
 The application is probably the simplest and 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.220
 usually which is in absolutely all 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.119
 nokia lumia phones but called but 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.380
 those panoramas 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.360
 This application allows you to shoot. 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.530
 most common panorama app 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 works very simply we do 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.000
 several pictures in a row then 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.470
 some kind of secret nokia technology 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360
 sew it all into one panorama and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.740
 we get such a big image but we 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.259
 can't make polar out of it 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.610
 panorama in the phone itself but you can 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.990
 then round out Photoshop 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 the second application is also available for 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 All Nokia Lumia phones are called 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.259
 photosynth she lets us shoot not 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.970
 quite ordinary panorama and three-dimensional 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.770
 there is absolutely everything that can be removed 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.450
 is around you this app 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.800
 allows you to get a three-dimensional image 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.390
 and and then maybe twist 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.549
 watch her from all sides but her 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.619
 cannot be saved as a polar panorama 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.170
 but you can save as a simple volumetric 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.490
 360 on frame and round out photoshop 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.110
 the next application about which 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.330
 tell unfortunately not available for 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.610
 nokia lumia but it is available for ios 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.079
 devices including for and banana it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 the application is called twisters she 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.770
 allows you to shoot 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.780
 volumetric panorama but flat that is, we 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.369
 can't make it polar but in 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.200
 principle to attach quite interesting 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 you can remove all that is around you 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.380
 and then watch it in real 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.570
 time is also present here mode 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.950
 360 selfies you can shoot 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.400
 yourself for this will have 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.880
 spin around like this and then you 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 get 360 selfies where you are 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.019
 there will be one face in one place and a background 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.180
 will change completely useless 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.180
 application but rather original 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.069
 this application also does not give us a function 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.049
 removing the polar panoramas but here 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.569
 there is an unusual camera mode here i am 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.970
 You can put on a timer that's why 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.650
 I put this application myself because 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 in a normal camera you cannot put it on 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.580
 a timer and this is sometimes very, very necessary 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.230
 itself and perhaps cool application for 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.829
 creating both conventional and polar 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.860
 panoramas called 360 just 360 us 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.110
 available in the appstore at a price of 30 rubles 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.909
 Well, what did you want for good and 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.069
 quality application will have at least 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.510
 but something to pay besides 30 rubles 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.829
 not such a big price for 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.569
 really high quality application 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.849
 application 306 from allows you to take pictures 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.079
 absolutely full panorama that is possible 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.780
 take off absolutely everything around 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.879
 you including earth and sky then ipad 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.590
 All this is about programming and will give us 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.790
 volumetric picture and maybe twist 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.709
 rotate look all that is 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.390
 around you and the feature is also available 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.390
 create polar panoramas 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.490
 the application is very easy to manage 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.560
 all you need to do is press the button 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.970
 start and then start spinning in all 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.290
 planes to get quality 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.599
 images without any distortion 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.790
 you need to turn the iPad like this not with your hands 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.470
 and spinning did to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 ipad has always been on the same volume 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.830
 same distance from you like that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.209
 turn to get good 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.430
 panorama and if you want to get 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.430
 You can do a bad panorama like this 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.120
 if you are not able to buy 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.620
 application 360 for various reasons we 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.720
 maybe the question is not want not to pay or 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.180
 you have no ios device you can do 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.220
 next clear the usual panorama then 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.870
 upload it photoshop take a picture 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.540
 square with your image 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.810
 stretch then flip it go 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.940
 in filter and distortion and polar panorama 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.680
 just like that even without the 360 ​​app 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.330
 you can make cool polar 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.040
 panoramas as you see in the creation 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.470
 polar panoramas there is absolutely nothing 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.150
 complicated and if you learned how to do them 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.950
 then especially for you less than five

 for example this or the most popular 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.810
 it's probably an acid green bottle 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.220
 in the fall but in general you can choose 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.840
