00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
use your LG xenon or as some people like

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.050 
use your LG xenon or as some people like
calling<00:00:21.259> it<00:00:21.380> xenon<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.340> how<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.580> use<00:00:22.880> it

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
calling it xenon so how to use it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.870 
calling it xenon so how to use it
without<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.110> SIM<00:00:24.349> card<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:24.890> I'm<00:00:25.160> just<00:00:25.730> going<00:00:25.849> to

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
without a SIM card so I'm just going to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.650 
without a SIM card so I'm just going to
prove<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.270> to<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.480> right<00:00:26.510> here<00:00:28.210> no<00:00:29.210> sim<00:00:29.449> card

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
prove it to you right here no sim card

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.019 
prove it to you right here no sim card
insert<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.199> my<00:00:30.560> sim<00:00:31.340> card<00:00:31.369> is<00:00:31.609> actually

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
insert because my sim card is actually

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.799 
insert because my sim card is actually
just<00:00:32.269> fell<00:00:32.689> from<00:00:33.050> on<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.620> floor<00:00:33.860> okay<00:00:34.809> but

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
just fell from on the floor okay but

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.600 
just fell from on the floor okay but
that<00:00:35.930> doesn't<00:00:35.960> matter<00:00:36.290> right<00:00:36.410> now<00:00:36.650> so<00:00:37.250> as<00:00:37.430> you

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
that doesn't matter right now so as you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.020 
that doesn't matter right now so as you
see<00:00:37.940> no<00:00:38.930> sim<00:00:39.170> card<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.589> I<00:00:40.280> will<00:00:40.489> just<00:00:40.640> put<00:00:40.879> the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
see no sim card and I will just put the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.920 
see no sim card and I will just put the
battery<00:00:41.210> in<00:00:41.600> there<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.050> turned<00:00:42.410> on<00:00:42.620> oops

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
battery in there and turned on oops

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:55.849 
battery in there and turned on oops
turn<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.080> on

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.680 

okay<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.519> still<00:00:59.850> can't<00:01:00.179> find<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.449> sim<00:01:00.659> card

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
okay and I still can't find my sim card

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
okay and I still can't find my sim card
on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> floor<00:01:01.260> under<00:01:01.949> mine<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.370> underneath

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on the floor under mine it's underneath

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
on the floor under mine it's underneath
your<00:01:02.789> keyboard<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.259> one<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
your keyboard so you will get one that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700 
your keyboard so you will get one that
says<00:01:07.619> insert<00:01:08.310> sim<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.590> basically

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
says insert sim and we can basically

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.120 
says insert sim and we can basically
bypass<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.640> by<00:01:12.060> using<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.570> LG<00:01:13.130> engineering

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bypass that by using the LG engineering

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.060 
bypass that by using the LG engineering
menu<00:01:14.520> which<00:01:14.729> base<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.289> today<00:01:16.289> I<00:01:16.320> will<00:01:16.530> go<00:01:16.830> into

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
menu which base and today I will go into

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.789 
menu which base and today I will go into
it<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.750> basically<00:01:18.750> trick<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> phone<00:01:19.560> into

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it and basically trick the phone into

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
it and basically trick the phone into
thinking<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.159> there's<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> sim<00:01:20.759> card<00:01:20.789> so<00:01:21.240> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
thinking that there's a sim card so we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
thinking that there's a sim card so we
would<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.929> emergency<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.799> lets<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
would go to emergency which lets you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.050 
would go to emergency which lets you
call<00:01:23.310> 911

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
call 911

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
call 911
etc<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.320> will<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> three<00:01:26.130> eight<00:01:27.080> four

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
etc so we will put in three eight four

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.450 
etc so we will put in three eight four
five<00:01:28.590> pound<00:01:29.399> star<00:01:30.270> five<00:01:31.020> zero<00:01:31.590> zero<00:01:31.649> pound

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
five pound star five zero zero pound

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
five pound star five zero zero pound
that<00:01:33.090> number<00:01:33.390> will<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.750> available<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that number will be available in the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.580 
that number will be available in the
description<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.990> as<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.289> right<00:01:37.319> now

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
description and as you see right now

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.279 
description and as you see right now
we're<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.520> search<00:01:38.700> menu<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
we're in a search menu now we go to the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.710 
we're in a search menu now we go to the
sim<00:01:40.649> test<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.119> everything<00:01:42.479> else<00:01:42.569> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sim test you know everything else for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
sim test you know everything else for
now<00:01:42.810> virtual<00:01:43.560> sim<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.190> it's<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.520> tricking

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
now virtual sim so it's like tricking

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.130 
now virtual sim so it's like tricking
the<00:01:44.940> phone<00:01:45.170> turn<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.819> yes<00:01:47.819> and<00:01:48.209> right<00:01:48.959> now

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the phone turn it and yes and right now

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.190 
the phone turn it and yes and right now
it's<00:01:50.039> not<00:01:50.399> rebooting<00:01:50.819> don't<00:01:51.000> worry<00:01:51.179> as<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's not rebooting don't worry as you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.820 
it's not rebooting don't worry as you
see<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.360> basically<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.020> trick<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> phone

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
see but basically just trick the phone

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.529 
see but basically just trick the phone
into<00:01:56.130> thinking<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.759> there's<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:59.269> sim<00:02:00.269> card<00:02:00.300> in

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
into thinking that there's a sim card in

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.779 
into thinking that there's a sim card in
there<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:01.410> instead<00:02:01.709> of<00:02:01.830> saying<00:02:02.009> Rogers<00:02:02.640> which

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
there but instead of saying Rogers which

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.850 
there but instead of saying Rogers which
I<00:02:02.910> usually<00:02:03.420> use<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.929> says<00:02:04.229> virtual<00:02:04.920> sim<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I usually use it says virtual sim so I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
I usually use it says virtual sim so I
guess<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.099> okay<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.789> can't<00:02:09.119> call

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
guess that's okay you just can't call

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.869 
guess that's okay you just can't call
anybody<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:10.709> even<00:02:10.950> 911<00:02:11.459> which<00:02:11.610> sucks

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
anybody with it not even 911 which sucks

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.589 
anybody with it not even 911 which sucks
but<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.349> hand<00:02:13.440> you've<00:02:14.280> got<00:02:14.519> all<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
but on the other hand you've got all the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360 
but on the other hand you've got all the
other<00:02:15.780> features<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.590> phone<00:02:16.800> has<00:02:16.830> except

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
other features that the phone has except

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.210 
other features that the phone has except
for<00:02:17.519> phone<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> Internet<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.129> to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
