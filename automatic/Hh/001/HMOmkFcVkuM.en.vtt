I go along this air 48 stages on Jill so

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.950 
I go along this air 48 stages on Jill so
as<00:00:46.429> Lords<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.879> fight<00:00:47.089> on<00:00:47.329> there's<00:00:47.749> eight

as Lords to fight on there's eight
different<00:00:47.989> characters<00:00:48.800> or<00:00:48.949> cubes<00:00:49.309> or

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
different characters or cubes or

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.380 
different characters or cubes or
whatever<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:49.969> they've<00:00:50.059> all<00:00:50.179> got<00:00:50.359> different

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
whatever and they've all got different

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.750 
whatever and they've all got different
abilities<00:00:51.109> this<00:00:51.710> one<00:00:51.920> here<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:52.370> age<00:00:52.489> basically

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
abilities this one here we age basically

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.700 
abilities this one here we age basically
our<00:00:53.030> spikes<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:53.629> again<00:00:54.170> I'll<00:00:54.289> get<00:00:54.409> onto<00:00:54.530> those

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
our spikes but again I'll get onto those

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.290 
our spikes but again I'll get onto those
powers<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.070> little<00:00:55.159> bit<00:00:55.280> later<00:00:55.670> because<00:00:55.909> after

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
powers a little bit later because after

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.610 
powers a little bit later because after
you<00:00:56.390> choose<00:00:56.600> your<00:00:56.629> cube<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.260> then<00:00:57.440> get<00:00:57.589> a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
you choose your cube you then get a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.380 
you choose your cube you then get a
random<00:00:57.859> opponents<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:58.999> can<00:00:59.149> choose<00:00:59.359> the

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
random opponents and you can choose the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.209 
random opponents and you can choose the
difficulty<00:01:00.019> of<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.140> opponents<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.010> that's

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
difficulty of that opponents and that's

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.979 
difficulty of that opponents and that's
pretty<00:01:01.370> much<00:01:01.460> happen<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.480> league<00:01:02.659> Ward

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
pretty much happen in the league Ward

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.540 
pretty much happen in the league Ward
you<00:01:03.230> don't<00:01:03.409> get<00:01:03.499> a<00:01:03.559> random<00:01:03.859> opponent<00:01:03.980> because

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
you don't get a random opponent because

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.550 
you don't get a random opponent because
obviously<00:01:04.790> you're<00:01:05.480> playing<00:01:05.780> select<00:01:06.290> opponent

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
obviously you're playing select opponent

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.770 
obviously you're playing select opponent
from<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> link<00:01:07.159> it's<00:01:07.880> anywhere<00:01:08.149> back<00:01:08.570> onto

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
from the link it's anywhere back onto

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.300 
from the link it's anywhere back onto
the<00:01:08.930> powers<00:01:09.259> basically<00:01:09.799> there's<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.040> one

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the powers basically there's this one

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.620 
the powers basically there's this one
here<00:01:10.340> which<00:01:10.700> basically<00:01:10.880> when<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:11.360> collect

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
here which basically when you collect

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.690 
here which basically when you collect
the<00:01:11.689> end<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.649> power<00:01:12.920> pellet<00:01:13.399> or<00:01:13.460> whatever

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
the end the power pellet or whatever

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.550 
the end the power pellet or whatever
it's<00:01:13.880> called<00:01:13.939> on<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.420> then<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.290> can<00:01:15.439> do

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's called on this then if you can do

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.230 
it's called on this then if you can do
use<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.829> special<00:01:16.310> power<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:16.909> i've<00:01:17.210> got

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
use a special power so this i've got

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.359 
use a special power so this i've got
spikes<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.079> i<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:18.200> wore<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:18.740> where<00:01:18.920> he<00:01:19.040> is

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
spikes so if i just wore but where he is

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.760 
spikes so if i just wore but where he is
and<00:01:19.700> push<00:01:19.969> the<00:01:20.119> exponent<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:21.110> spikes<00:01:21.469> of<00:01:21.649> all

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
and push the exponent then spikes of all

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.649 
and push the exponent then spikes of all
on<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.070> his<00:01:22.340> side<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> few<00:01:23.090> seconds<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
on that his side for a few seconds and

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.690 
on that his side for a few seconds and
that<00:01:23.840> basically<00:01:24.229> screw<00:01:24.500> them<00:01:24.680> over<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.399> ones

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
that basically screw them over this ones

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.639 
that basically screw them over this ones
that<00:01:25.939> have<00:01:26.149> course<00:01:26.479> cubes<00:01:26.930> come<00:01:27.170> out<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.530> they

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
that have course cubes come out so they

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.410 
that have course cubes come out so they
can<00:01:27.829> help<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.130> collect<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.520> pellets<00:01:28.850> this

can help you collect the pellets this
ones<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.780> are<00:01:29.899> speed<00:01:30.200> boosts<00:01:30.649> because<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
ones that are speed boosts because the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.219 
ones that are speed boosts because the
whole<00:01:31.549> point<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.659> collect<00:01:32.930> all

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
whole point is you have to collect all

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.020 
whole point is you have to collect all
the<00:01:33.289> pellets<00:01:33.590> what<00:01:34.130> will<00:01:34.250> on<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.520> stage<00:01:34.789> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
the pellets what will on the stage to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.560 
the pellets what will on the stage to
win<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.240> round

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
win the round

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.330 
win the round
basically<00:01:36.439> every<00:01:36.740> time<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.009> collect<00:01:37.159> the

basically every time you collect the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.770 
basically every time you collect the
fifth<00:01:37.579> of<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.789> pellets<00:01:38.149> then<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.509> get<00:01:38.659> an

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
fifth of the pellets then you get an

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.170 
fifth of the pellets then you get an
order<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.049> charge<00:01:39.320> up<00:01:39.649> and<00:01:39.860> go<00:01:40.039> for<00:01:40.219> a<00:01:40.250> ball<00:01:40.490> at

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
order to charge up and go for a ball at

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.850 
order to charge up and go for a ball at
that<00:01:41.270> point<00:01:41.689> you'll<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.079> swap<00:01:42.380> over<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
that point you'll then swap over to the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.319 
that point you'll then swap over to the
other<00:01:42.979> side<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.579> go<00:01:43.759> up<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> middle<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
other side and go up the middle of the

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.179 
other side and go up the middle of the
stage<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.899> you've<00:01:45.289> got<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.530> do<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.829> as<00:01:45.950> i<00:01:46.039> see

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.000 
involving the square design there's
loads<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.900> different<00:03:16.959> levels<00:03:17.680> were<00:03:17.800> things

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
loads of different levels were things

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.030 
loads of different levels were things
like<00:03:18.100> lumps<00:03:18.730> lumps<00:03:19.480> bumps<00:03:20.290> loop-de-loops

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
like lumps lumps bumps loop-de-loops

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710 
like lumps lumps bumps loop-de-loops
just<00:03:21.280> things<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.790> now<00:03:22.330> totally

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
just things like that now totally

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.479 
just things like that now totally
getting<00:03:22.930> drunk<00:03:23.110> twisted<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.500> anyway<00:03:24.250> this

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
getting drunk twisted that anyway this

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.280 
getting drunk twisted that anyway this
also<00:03:24.670> than<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> time<00:03:25.510> attack<00:03:25.780> mode<00:03:25.840> where

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
also than the time attack mode where

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.750 
also than the time attack mode where
basically<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.860> whole<00:03:26.980> point<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.310> again<00:03:27.519> to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
basically the whole point is again to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.460 
basically the whole point is again to
get<00:03:27.910> five<00:03:28.239> goals<00:03:28.569> but<00:03:28.900> against<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.290> time

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
get five goals but against the time

get five goals but against the time
limit<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:29.980> not<00:03:30.220> against<00:03:30.610> any<00:03:30.730> fours<00:03:31.060> or

because<00:03:40.360> I<00:03:40.420> have<00:03:40.569> mentioned<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.959> was<00:03:41.080> 32<00:03:41.440> time

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
because I have mentioned it was 32 time

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.890 
because I have mentioned it was 32 time
trials<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.760> minigames<00:03:43.269> again<00:03:43.630> are<00:03:43.750> just

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
basically like time trials you have to

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.190 
basically like time trials you have to
collect<00:03:45.850> all<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.299> pellets<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:46.989> time

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
collect all the pellets but this time

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.470 
collect all the pellets but this time
you<00:03:47.350> only<00:03:47.380> have<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.799> get<00:03:47.950> there<00:03:48.160> once<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.850> you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
you only have to get there once and you

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.240 
you only have to get there once and you
have<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.750> basically<00:03:49.870> avoid<00:03:50.440> these<00:03:50.709> cubes<00:03:51.130> are

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
have to basically avoid these cubes are

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.710 
have to basically avoid these cubes are
coming<00:03:51.519> down<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.819> enemies<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.360> you<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.569> to

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
coming down the enemies and you have to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.320 
coming down the enemies and you have to
activate<00:03:53.350> switches<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.160> well<00:03:54.730> kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.120> switch

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
activate switches to well kind of switch

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.870 
activate switches to well kind of switch
puzzle<00:03:55.720> type<00:03:55.870> things<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.410> get<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.160> platforms

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
puzzle type things to get the platforms

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
puzzle type things to get the platforms
to<00:03:58.030> work<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.690> go<00:03:58.780> across<00:03:58.989> them<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
to work so you can go across them and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.930 
to work so you can go across them and
again<00:03:59.950> if<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.190> get<00:04:00.340> hit<00:04:00.549> then<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.760> lose<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
again if you get hit then you lose the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.390 
again if you get hit then you lose the
pellets<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.049> there's<00:04:02.440> definitely<00:04:03.040> plenty<00:04:03.160> to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
pellets so there's definitely plenty to

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400 
pellets so there's definitely plenty to
do<00:04:03.519> on<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.730> GIMP<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.209> 48<00:04:04.630> jewel<00:04:04.930> stage<00:04:05.230> is

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
do on the GIMP that's 48 jewel stage is

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.890 
do on the GIMP that's 48 jewel stage is
32<00:04:05.859> time<00:04:06.130> trial<00:04:06.489> aunt<00:04:07.030> minigame<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.660> think

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900
