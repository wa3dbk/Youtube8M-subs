you<00:03:39.400> obviously<00:03:39.730> saw<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.000> took<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.210> couple

to<00:03:43.390> get<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.870> part<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.530> just

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
to get going part of that was just

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.950 
to get going part of that was just
operator<00:03:45.160> error<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.520> didn't<00:03:45.850> strike<00:03:46.120> excuse<00:03:46.810> me

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
operator error I didn't strike excuse me

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.840 
operator error I didn't strike excuse me
very<00:03:47.560> accurately<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.130> first<00:03:48.310> time<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:48.700> this

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
very accurately the first time but this

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.280 
very accurately the first time but this
generally<00:03:49.360> does<00:03:49.510> take<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> little<00:03:49.900> bit<00:03:50.080> more

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
generally does take a little bit more

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.620 
generally does take a little bit more
just<00:03:51.040> because<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.940> way<00:03:52.450> it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
just because of the the way it's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.410 
just because of the the way it's
actually<00:03:53.020> it<00:03:53.620> grows<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.850> just<00:03:55.060> doesn't<00:03:55.300> have

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
actually it grows it just doesn't have

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.850 
actually it grows it just doesn't have
the<00:03:55.450> same<00:03:55.720> surface<00:03:55.990> area<00:03:56.350> doesn't<00:03:56.470> catch<00:03:56.740> as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
the same surface area doesn't catch as

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.530 
the same surface area doesn't catch as
quickly<00:03:57.040> as<00:03:57.250> cat<00:03:57.460> tail<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.790> Phragmites<00:03:58.300> but

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
quickly as cat tail and Phragmites but

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.190 
quickly as cat tail and Phragmites but
still<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> good<00:03:59.410> option<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.780> last<00:04:01.960> time<00:04:02.110> we're

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
still a good option the last time we're

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:16.199 
still a good option the last time we're
looking<00:04:02.410> at<00:04:02.500> here<00:04:02.710> is<00:04:02.890> birch<00:04:03.460> bark

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.219 

it's<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.269> little<00:04:17.359> bit<00:04:17.479> hard<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.720> see<00:04:17.870> on<00:04:17.900> camera

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
it's a little bit hard to see on camera

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.810 
it's a little bit hard to see on camera
but<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.709> can<00:04:18.859> probably<00:04:19.070> actually<00:04:19.310> tell<00:04:19.669> let

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
but you can probably actually tell let

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.400 
but you can probably actually tell let
me<00:04:19.850> just<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.209> camera<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.540> little<00:04:20.570> bit<00:04:20.870> yeah<00:04:21.290> you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
me just the camera a little bit yeah you

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.780 
me just the camera a little bit yeah you
can<00:04:21.560> see<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.859> smoke<00:04:22.070> coming<00:04:22.400> off<00:04:22.520> is

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
can see that smoke coming off is

on<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.100> bottom<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.550> then<00:04:43.669> slightly<00:04:43.880> larger

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
on the bottom and then slightly larger

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.330 
on the bottom and then slightly larger
slightly<00:04:44.750> larger<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.260> then<00:04:46.040> he<00:04:46.130> would<00:04:46.220> give

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
slightly larger and then he would give
