you<00:02:21.080> can<00:02:21.200> see<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.950> really

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you can see here that I'm really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.010 
you can see here that I'm really
focusing<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.880> color<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.390> outer<00:02:23.660> V<00:02:23.840> area

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
focusing that color in the outer V area

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.290 
focusing that color in the outer V area
and<00:02:24.650> keeping<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.070> lid<00:02:25.310> space<00:02:25.550> nice<00:02:26.060> and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and keeping that lid space nice and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.260 
and keeping that lid space nice and
light<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:28.160> want<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.370> try<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.550> do<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.790> too

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
light so you want to try to do that too

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.760 
light so you want to try to do that too
now<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.660> next<00:02:29.900> bit<00:02:30.020> didn't<00:02:30.290> really<00:02:30.470> show<00:02:30.620> up

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
now this next bit didn't really show up

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.890 
now this next bit didn't really show up
much<00:02:30.920> on<00:02:31.070> camera<00:02:31.460> but<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> still<00:02:32.210> did<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.870> I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
much on camera but I still did it so I

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.390 
much on camera but I still did it so I
might<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.530> tell<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.800> what<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> did<00:02:34.190> I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
might as well just tell you what I did I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.490 
might as well just tell you what I did I
added<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.300> bit<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.660> matte<00:02:35.900> pink<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
added a bit of this matte pink to the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.920 
added a bit of this matte pink to the
crease<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:37.760> because<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.300> my<00:02:38.390> colors<00:02:38.660> to

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
crease just because I like my colors to

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.230 
crease just because I like my colors to
fade<00:02:39.230> out<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:39.770> my<00:02:40.010> smoke<00:02:40.250> out<00:02:40.430> usually<00:02:40.910> so

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
fade out in my smoke out usually so

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.960 
fade out in my smoke out usually so
purple<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.260> pink<00:02:42.290> makes<00:02:42.860> sense<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.280> me<00:02:43.400> so

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
purple to pink makes sense to me so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.520 
purple to pink makes sense to me so
going<00:02:44.270> back<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.600> with<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.930> purple<00:02:45.470> again

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
going back in with that purple again

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.410 
going back in with that purple again
this<00:02:46.190> time<00:02:46.430> I'm<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.670> taking<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.120> smaller

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
this time I'm just taking a smaller

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.820 
this time I'm just taking a smaller
pencil<00:02:47.840> brush<00:02:48.020> for<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.320> more<00:02:48.500> precise

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
pencil brush for a more precise

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.040 
pencil brush for a more precise
application<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.910> then<00:02:50.510> I'm<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.870> building

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
application and then I'm just building

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.110 
application and then I'm just building
up<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.350> color<00:02:51.560> blending<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> out<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.880> then

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
up the color blending it out and then

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.760 
up the color blending it out and then
just<00:02:53.150> rinse<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.930> repeat<00:02:54.230> until<00:02:54.410> you're<00:02:54.650> happy

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
just rinse and repeat until you're happy

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.620 
just rinse and repeat until you're happy
with<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.340> color<00:02:55.370> intensity<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:59.300> instead<00:02:59.570> of

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
with the color intensity so instead of

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.900 
with the color intensity so instead of
doing<00:02:59.870> my<00:02:59.959> usual<00:03:00.200> kind<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.709> thick<00:03:00.980> gel<00:03:01.370> liner<00:03:01.610> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
doing my usual kind of thick gel liner I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.430 
doing my usual kind of thick gel liner I
decided<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.450> go<00:03:02.570> with<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> grey<00:03:03.140> from<00:03:03.350> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
decided to go with the grey from the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.230 
decided to go with the grey from the
palette<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:03.860> just<00:03:03.920> take<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.000> us<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
palette and just take that for us to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.480 
palette and just take that for us to
lashline<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.740> creating<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.190> line

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
lashline I think creating that line

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.790 
lashline I think creating that line
between<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.360> eyeshadow<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.380> lashes

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
between the eyeshadow and the lashes

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.110 
between the eyeshadow and the lashes
really<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.370> pulls<00:03:10.580> everything<00:03:10.880> together

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
really just pulls everything together

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.790 
really just pulls everything together
and<00:03:11.600> makes<00:03:11.780> everything<00:03:12.050> look<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.380> bit<00:03:12.650> more

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
and makes everything look a bit more

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.890 
and makes everything look a bit more
finished<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:14.150> also<00:03:14.270> makes<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> lashes

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
finished and it also makes the lashes

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.840 
finished and it also makes the lashes
look<00:03:14.959> fuller<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.709> if<00:03:16.040> you're<00:03:16.490> not<00:03:16.610> wearing

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
look fuller so if you're not wearing

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.610 
look fuller so if you're not wearing
false<00:03:17.060> lashes<00:03:17.180> then<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:18.050> will<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.410> really

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
false lashes then this will be really

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.509 
false lashes then this will be really
beneficial<00:03:20.830> next<00:03:21.830> I'm<00:03:21.980> taking<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.370> white

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
base again and this time I'm taking it

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440 
base again and this time I'm taking it
underneath<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.890> eye<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.430> then<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.269> over

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450

take<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.300> about<00:03:29.600> two-thirds<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> way

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
take this about two-thirds of the way

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.530 
take this about two-thirds of the way
underneath<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.250> eye<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.640> then<00:03:31.940> also<00:03:32.269> bring

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
underneath the eye and then also bring

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.020 
underneath the eye and then also bring
around<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.260> inner<00:03:33.470> corner<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.160> open<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
around the inner corner and open to the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.350 
around the inner corner and open to the
lid<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> bit<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:35.570> well<00:03:36.700> next<00:03:37.700> I'm<00:03:37.850> taking<00:03:37.910> that

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
lid a bit as well next I'm taking that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.000 
lid a bit as well next I'm taking that
dark<00:03:38.630> grey<00:03:38.810> again<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.560> time<00:03:39.800> I'm

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
dark grey again and this time I'm

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.070 
dark grey again and this time I'm
applying<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.120> outer<00:03:41.450> third<00:03:41.750> and

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
applying that in the outer third and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.290 
applying that in the outer third and
then<00:03:42.500> I'm<00:03:42.739> blending<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.280> into<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.760> blue<00:03:44.000> I

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
then I'm blending it into that blue I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300 
then I'm blending it into that blue I
always<00:03:44.810> like<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.170> dark<00:03:45.530> color<00:03:45.860> around<00:03:46.190> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
always like a dark color around the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.070 
always like a dark color around the
edges<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.700> my<00:03:46.730> eye<00:03:46.850> because<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.810> think<00:03:47.959> it

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
edges of my eye because I just think it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.750 
edges of my eye because I just think it
helps<00:03:48.350> with<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.739> overall<00:03:49.190> shape<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
helps with the overall shape of the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.720 
helps with the overall shape of the
eyeshadow<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:51.680> don't<00:03:52.010> know<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:52.100> just<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.610> I

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
eyeshadow and I don't know I just like I

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.670 
eyeshadow and I don't know I just like I
like<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> gradient<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.660> can't<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.650> one

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
like a gradient I can't just have one

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.830 
like a gradient I can't just have one
color<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.519> always<00:03:55.790> have<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.060> do<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.390> five

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
color I always have to do like five

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.289 
color I always have to do like five
different<00:03:57.200> colors<00:03:57.709> every<00:03:57.950> single<00:03:58.250> time<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:59.000> I

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
different colors every single time but I

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.390 
different colors every single time but I
think<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.780> works<00:03:59.989> then<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> went<00:04:00.980> over<00:04:01.130> with<00:04:01.370> a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
think it works then I went over with a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.610 
think it works then I went over with a
little<00:04:01.549> bit<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:01.940> elderberry<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.870> add<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.230> purple

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
little bit of elderberry to add a purple

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.620 
little bit of elderberry to add a purple
tint<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:04.100> kind<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.459> make<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.120> top<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.570> the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
tint to kind of make the top and the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.270 
tint to kind of make the top and the
bottom<00:04:05.750> flow<00:04:06.080> together<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.500> bit<00:04:06.739> better<00:04:06.890> and

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
bottom flow together a bit better and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.710 
bottom flow together a bit better and
then<00:04:07.459> you<00:04:07.700> want<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> take<00:04:08.120> any<00:04:08.420> kind<00:04:08.660> of

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
then you want to take any kind of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.120 
then you want to take any kind of
blending<00:04:09.080> brush<00:04:09.290> my<00:04:09.560> favorite<00:04:09.980> for

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
blending brush my favorite for

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.800 
blending brush my favorite for
underneath<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.549> eye<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:11.269> course<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
underneath the eye is of course the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.530 
underneath the eye is of course the
Sigma<00:04:12.200> e30<00:04:12.650> 2<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.180> just<00:04:14.360> want<00:04:14.510> to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
Sigma e30 2 and then you just want to

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.930 
Sigma e30 2 and then you just want to
blend<00:04:14.720> those<00:04:14.930> edges<00:04:15.290> out<00:04:15.410> now<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:16.519> bit<00:04:16.700> isn't

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
blend those edges out now this bit isn't

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.360 
blend those edges out now this bit isn't
necessary<00:04:17.450> but<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.840> hate<00:04:18.169> leaving<00:04:18.410> any<00:04:18.919> part<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
necessary but I hate leaving any part of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.280 
necessary but I hate leaving any part of
the<00:04:19.459> eye<00:04:19.519> unattended<00:04:20.299> -<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.840> just<00:04:20.989> drives<00:04:21.229> me

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
the eye unattended - it just drives me

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.650 
the eye unattended - it just drives me
crazy<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:22.130> I'm<00:04:22.430> also<00:04:22.729> tightlining<00:04:23.210> with<00:04:23.630> a

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
crazy so I'm also tightlining with a

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.790 
crazy so I'm also tightlining with a
dark<00:04:23.990> blue<00:04:24.140> line

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
dark blue line

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.580 
dark blue line
and<00:04:24.889> this<00:04:25.639> isn't<00:04:26.060> from<00:04:26.509> this<00:04:26.810> collection<00:04:27.319> but

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and this isn't from this collection but

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.620 
and this isn't from this collection but
it's<00:04:27.710> still<00:04:27.889> by<00:04:28.069> Sigma<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.639> then<00:04:29.120> I'm<00:04:29.419> also

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
it's still by Sigma and then I'm also

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.390 
it's still by Sigma and then I'm also
running<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.229> gorgeous<00:04:30.650> baby<00:04:30.949> blue<00:04:31.160> liner

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
running a gorgeous baby blue liner

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.760 
running a gorgeous baby blue liner
across<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> lower<00:04:32.210> while<00:04:32.449> spine<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.110> again

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
across the lower while spine and again

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.990 
across the lower while spine and again
this<00:04:33.919> isn't<00:04:34.160> from<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.550> fall<00:04:34.699> softly

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
this isn't from the fall softly

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.580 
this isn't from the fall softly
collection<00:04:35.479> but<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.870> does<00:04:36.050> work<00:04:36.229> really

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
collection but it does work really

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.900 
collection but it does work really
nicely<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:37.099> this<00:04:37.310> palette<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:40.550> highlight<00:04:40.880> I

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
nicely with this palette the highlight I

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.670 
nicely with this palette the highlight I
decided<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.449> go<00:04:41.539> with<00:04:41.720> was<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.289> bit<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.590> an

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
decided to go with was a bit of an

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.320 
decided to go with was a bit of an
unusual<00:04:43.130> choice<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:43.759> think<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.150> worked

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
unusual choice but I think it worked

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.779 
unusual choice but I think it worked
with<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.599> look<00:04:44.750> quite<00:04:44.930> nicely<00:04:45.139> and<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:46.099> decided

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
with the look quite nicely and I decided

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.070 
with the look quite nicely and I decided
to<00:04:46.940> use<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.240> gold<00:04:47.449> color<00:04:47.750> from<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> palette

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
to use the gold color from the palette

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.050 
to use the gold color from the palette
and<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.919> applied<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.370> really<00:04:49.789> lightly

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
and I applied this really lightly

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.659 
and I applied this really lightly
underneath<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.810> brow<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:51.919> roughly<00:04:52.370> in

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
underneath the brow and then roughly in

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.670 
underneath the brow and then roughly in
the<00:04:52.849> inner<00:04:53.120> corner<00:04:53.449> dark<00:04:53.810> side<00:04:54.199> of<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.470> nose

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
the inner corner dark side of the nose

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.129 
the inner corner dark side of the nose
kind<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.250> area<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:56.150> mascara<00:04:56.509> I<00:04:56.599> used<00:04:56.930> today

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
kind of area the mascara I used today

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.469 
kind of area the mascara I used today
was<00:04:57.560> by<00:04:57.860> eyeko<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:58.610> I've<00:04:58.970> been<00:04:59.120> loving<00:04:59.300> this

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
was by eyeko and I've been loving this

recently and it's not quite as thick as
my<00:05:01.880> usual<00:05:02.090> mascara<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.050> ideal<00:05:03.380> for<00:05:03.409> like

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979

pretty<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:10.099> it<00:06:10.279> kind<00:06:10.490> of<00:06:10.550> went<00:06:10.729> with<00:06:10.819> the<00:06:10.969> look

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
pretty and it kind of went with the look

instead<00:06:15.650> I<00:06:15.710> changed<00:06:16.339> to<00:06:16.580> just<00:06:16.819> using<00:06:17.120> the<00:06:17.240> lip

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
instead I changed to just using the lip

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.269 
instead I changed to just using the lip
base<00:06:17.599> and<00:06:17.839> indulging<00:06:18.319> and<00:06:18.469> leaving<00:06:19.039> it<00:06:19.159> like

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
base and indulging and leaving it like

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.090 
base and indulging and leaving it like
that

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100
