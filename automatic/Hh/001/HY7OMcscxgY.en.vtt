00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.069 
you know when it was obviously down but
our<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.560> Daniel<00:01:44.280> Bryan<00:01:44.869> perform<00:01:45.869> better

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
our one with Daniel Bryan perform better

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.359 
our one with Daniel Bryan perform better
so<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
so I think you know they don't really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060 
so I think you know they don't really
have<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> worry<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.850> much<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.710> raw<00:01:49.710> right

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
have to worry too much about raw right

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.069 
have to worry too much about raw right
now<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.030> focus<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.420> Smackdown<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
now if they can focus on Smackdown and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.469 
now if they can focus on Smackdown and
putting<00:01:52.320> John<00:01:52.530> seen<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.890> Smackdown<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.670> think

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
putting John seen on Smackdown I think

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660 
putting John seen on Smackdown I think
would<00:01:54.689> definitely<00:01:55.229> help<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:56.610> think

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
would definitely help I don't think

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
would definitely help I don't think

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
think that maybe the main event and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.830 
think that maybe the main event and
still<00:02:43.500> ends<00:02:43.770> up<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.310> vacant<00:02:44.550> John<00:02:45.540> Cena

comes back and he won the World
Heavyweight<00:02:47.190> Championship<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.270> honestly

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
Heavyweight Championship I honestly

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.840 
Heavyweight Championship I honestly
truly<00:02:49.500> believe<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.400> could<00:02:50.640> lead<00:02:50.790> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
truly believe that this could lead to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.710 
truly believe that this could lead to
potentially<00:02:51.570> an<00:02:51.980> undisputed<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.160> one<00:02:53.940> WWE

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
potentially an undisputed or one WWE

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.470 
potentially an undisputed or one WWE
Championship<00:02:55.670> because<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.270> now

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
Championship because I think right now

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
Championship because I think right now
the<00:02:57.540> Demi<00:02:58.020> realizes<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.650> our<00:02:58.770> new<00:02:58.890> wwetitle

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the Demi realizes with our new wwetitle

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.130 
the Demi realizes with our new wwetitle
they<00:02:59.640> want<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.510> WWE

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
they want that to be the WWE

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.220 
they want that to be the WWE
Championship<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.390> maybe<00:03:03.959> they

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
Championship and I think maybe they

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.090 
Championship and I think maybe they
think<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.800> World<00:03:04.980> Heavyweight

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
think that the World Heavyweight

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.460 
think that the World Heavyweight
Championship<00:03:05.730> now<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.660> tracks<00:03:06.959> from<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.230> I'm

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
Championship now the tracks from it I'm

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.840 
Championship now the tracks from it I'm
all<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.860> one<00:03:08.040> titles<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> undisputed

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
all for one titles and undisputed

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.940 
all for one titles and undisputed
champion<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.570> company<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
champion in the company and I think the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.830 
champion in the company and I think the
WV<00:03:11.280> championship<00:03:11.820> perfectly<00:03:12.300> represents

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
WV championship perfectly represents

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440 
WV championship perfectly represents
that<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.740> hopefully<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:15.030> they<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:15.270> that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that and hopefully I think they go that

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.750 
that and hopefully I think they go that
route<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.680> know<00:03:16.770> that's<00:03:16.950> kind<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.250> what<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.459> had

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.130 
route you know that's kind of what I had
predicted<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.239> John<00:03:18.480> Cena<00:03:18.750> being<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
