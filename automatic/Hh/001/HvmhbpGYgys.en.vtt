they're<00:01:37.590> super<00:01:38.189> easy<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.640> catch<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.570> think

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
they're super easy to catch me I think

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.819 
the first the first time I pulled up you
can<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.200> multiple<00:01:43.380> hooks

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
can because you can have multiple hooks
