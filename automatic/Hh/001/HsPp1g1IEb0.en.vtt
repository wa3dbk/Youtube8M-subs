00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello, how are we doing? 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.260
 better late than never 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.830
 the two iphones 5 the white and the black 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.460
 have them good so let's see what 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.779
 they have in the east the two are 32 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 gigabytes is good and they are already 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.619
 packaged but so that you yours 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.230
 Real and good after the usual 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 for manzanita and melted and that the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 reviews what happens is that I like it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.800
 is in these things because it was avoided in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 weapons but now that I'm doing it 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 I think this is a folic task that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 you feel 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 once so that of projects and I start 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.280
 a review and I do not have scissors 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.840
 and we are here well then good for 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.190
 any is that we start if an example 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.980
 I'm going to start 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.869
 because by white itself we will see that 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.869
 brings whitish 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.150
 I love to unpack what 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.150
 what a feeling is a taste 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.680
 This plastic truth 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.040

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.110

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.979
 this time let's do him 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.979
 we had to open this 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.340
 and we are going to be the two birds 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 what good is coming 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.070
 the black put me tempered of a cover 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.070
 it consistent with going to like soft 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.350

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.510
 It is so light 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.510
 so beautiful is this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.080
 is beautiful 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 look black to see how it is also 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.230
 feels great 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.700
 but if it's white but the good is better 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 because 200 song to me I do not like me 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:51.250
 I prefer it like that and then it happens what 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 come on let's leave the phones here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.440
 let's cut the covers 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.300

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.480
 what are these manuals the plug of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.130
 whenever it's values because on the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.440
 that we are going to see well take out the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.490
 apple community under bullshit 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.510
 I also liked that you tell me about the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.650
 own what was focused on the need 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.650
 to have work 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.010

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.810
 Greek 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.180

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.180
 to see what just being bots 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.180
 pretty 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.720
 I expected to see the phone clear 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.280
 lightning god is dwarf inning look and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.330

 I the religious seen very large 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.360
 in the dwarf lessons you can not 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.580
 get an idea of ​​how small it is 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.680
 good unless you have it clear 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.880
 and well it also contains the typical 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:16.220
 december tan tram and the trees that already 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.940
 we know they hit a nice 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.390
 in the hand 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.390

 Precious good guys, well, we'll bring you 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.400
 the review the truth that they are

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.969
 finishes could only be from apple that 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.880
 it is clear because because much 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.460
 samsung 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.020

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.889

 It is progressing a lot also good 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.419
 guys, it's good, but we've 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.180
 taught the physical part to see that here 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.389
 are the two headphones that is the 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.870
 input minijack speakers microphones and 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:10.410

 he put them iphone is worth here is 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.340

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.150
