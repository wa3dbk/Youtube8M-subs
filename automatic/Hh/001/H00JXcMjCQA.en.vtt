that<00:03:55.930> those<00:03:56.470> communications<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.849> their

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
that those communications out of their

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.550 
that those communications out of their
ears<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.599> see<00:03:58.810> how<00:03:58.989> they<00:03:59.110> do<00:03:59.170> on<00:03:59.319> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
ears just see how they do on the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.470 
ears just see how they do on the
starting<00:03:59.980> line<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.459> think<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:01.030> might<00:04:01.239> make<00:04:01.269> a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
starting line I think that might make a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.880 
starting line I think that might make a
huge<00:04:02.049> difference

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
huge difference

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.699 
huge difference
