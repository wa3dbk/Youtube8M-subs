00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
there with a hot glue gun so I'm going

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
there with a hot glue gun so I'm going
to<00:01:14.100> give<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> shy

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.649 

that<00:01:35.710> took<00:01:35.950> all<00:01:36.100> of<00:01:36.159> seven<00:01:36.759> seconds<00:01:37.329> to<00:01:37.479> do<00:01:37.630> I

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
that took all of seven seconds to do I

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.800 
that took all of seven seconds to do I
needed<00:01:38.079> to<00:01:38.170> use<00:01:38.350> both<00:01:38.590> hands<00:01:38.920> but<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:40.390> head<00:01:40.630> of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
needed to use both hands but the head of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.990 
needed to use both hands but the head of
that<00:01:40.990> boat<00:01:41.229> fits<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.979> there<00:01:42.130> pretty<00:01:42.340> perfectly

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
that boat fits in there pretty perfectly

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.089 
that boat fits in there pretty perfectly
so<00:01:43.719> just<00:01:44.109> when<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.319> go<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.469> glue<00:01:44.709> it<00:01:44.740> make<00:01:45.069> sure

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
so just when you go to glue it make sure

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.789 
so just when you go to glue it make sure
that<00:01:45.579> this<00:01:45.729> is<00:01:45.969> as<00:01:46.209> level<00:01:47.109> as<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.229> can<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.679> it

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
that this is as level as you can get it

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.620 
that this is as level as you can get it
when<00:01:48.099> I<00:01:48.130> put<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.490> in<00:01:48.579> there<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.909> first<00:01:49.119> time<00:01:49.240> it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
when I put it in there the first time it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.789 
when I put it in there the first time it
see<00:01:49.899> it's<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.140> little<00:01:50.409> off<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:52.049> yeah<00:01:53.049> pretty

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
see it's a little off but yeah pretty

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.229 
see it's a little off but yeah pretty
simple<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:55.569> had<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:55.959> glue<00:01:56.200> gun<00:01:56.439> but<00:01:56.829> I<00:01:57.670> was

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
simple and I had this glue gun but I was

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.359 
simple and I had this glue gun but I was
also<00:01:58.390> thinking<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.929> could<00:01:59.079> probably<00:01:59.289> use<00:01:59.799> jb

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
also thinking you could probably use jb

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.609 
also thinking you could probably use jb
weld<00:02:00.579> and<00:02:00.989> just<00:02:01.989> cover<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.349> over<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.969> if<00:02:04.619> that

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
weld and just cover that over so if that

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.319 
weld and just cover that over so if that
was<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.069> case<00:02:06.099> you're<00:02:06.579> probably<00:02:06.759> looking

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
was the case you're probably looking

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.270 
was the case you're probably looking
about<00:02:07.450> five<00:02:07.840> dollars<00:02:08.079> total<00:02:08.590> cost<00:02:08.950> which

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
about five dollars total cost which

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.690 
about five dollars total cost which
still<00:02:09.549> isn't<00:02:09.759> really<00:02:10.629> much<00:02:10.840> considering<00:02:11.700> what

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
still isn't really much considering what

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.780 
still isn't really much considering what
you've<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:12.879> made<00:02:13.299> so<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.049> online<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:15.129> harbor

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you've just made so and online on harbor

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.490 
you've just made so and online on harbor
freights<00:02:16.000> website<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.569> says<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.109> suction

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
freights website it says this suction

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.000 
freights website it says this suction
cup<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.829> rated<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:18.220> 80<00:02:18.609> pounds<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:20.410> guess

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
cup is rated for 80 pounds of I guess

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.180 
cup is rated for 80 pounds of I guess
that's<00:02:21.250> how<00:02:21.400> much<00:02:21.579> suction<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.359> is<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.190> I'm

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that's how much suction it is so I'm

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.580 
that's how much suction it is so I'm
gonna<00:02:24.340> glue<00:02:24.549> it<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.760> there<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.090> then<00:02:25.780> i<00:02:26.170> will

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
gonna glue it in there and then i will

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.610 
gonna glue it in there and then i will
make<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.160> test<00:02:27.459> video<00:02:27.700> later<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.440> we'll<00:02:29.440> see

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
make a test video later and we'll see

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.920 
make a test video later and we'll see
how<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.769> works<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:34.209> hard<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
how it works it's hard to get it to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.650 
how it works it's hard to get it to
focus<00:02:35.139> but<00:02:35.739> what<00:02:36.099> i<00:02:36.130> did<00:02:36.370> was<00:02:36.639> basically<00:02:36.910> put

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
focus but what i did was basically put

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.580 
focus but what i did was basically put
two<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:39.000> spots<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.209> hot<00:02:40.480> glue<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:41.049> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
two little spots of hot glue on the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.349 
two little spots of hot glue on the
sides<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> hole<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.549> then<00:02:42.819> stuck<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
sides of the hole and then stuck the

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.050 
sides of the hole and then stuck the
bolt<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.160> then<00:02:45.160> i<00:02:45.489> put<00:02:45.669> it<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> there

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
bolt to it and then i put it in there

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.520 
bolt to it and then i put it in there
and<00:02:46.180> basically<00:02:46.329> pour<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.019> bunch<00:02:47.169> of<00:02:47.349> hot

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and basically pour it a bunch of hot

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.550 
and basically pour it a bunch of hot
glue<00:02:47.739> over<00:02:48.669> top<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.269> so<00:02:49.419> it<00:02:49.720> spreads<00:02:50.049> more

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
glue over top of it so it spreads more

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.339 
glue over top of it so it spreads more
or<00:02:50.709> less<00:02:50.889> sealed<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.489> there<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.780> bolt

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
or less sealed in there so that bolt

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.890 
or less sealed in there so that bolt
won't<00:02:53.620> come<00:02:53.859> out<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.790> that's<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.000> it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
won't come out and that's it it's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900 
won't come out and that's it it's
finished<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.650> for<00:02:59.980> five<00:03:00.160> dollars<00:03:00.549> in<00:03:00.700> five

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
finished so for five dollars in five

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.059 
finished so for five dollars in five
minutes<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.389> time<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:02.079> can<00:03:02.319> have<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> suction

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
minutes of time you can have a suction

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.860 
minutes of time you can have a suction
cup<00:03:03.220> camera<00:03:03.669> mount

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.899 

so<00:03:08.470> here<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.920> stuck<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.819> side<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:11.560> van

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
so here it is stuck to the side of a van

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:19.170 
so here it is stuck to the side of a van
but<00:03:12.909> basically<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.750> get<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> idea<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
but basically you get the idea and I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.440 
but basically you get the idea and I
will<00:03:19.390> definitely<00:03:19.569> give<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.200> try
