over 10 days and the first and last day
we<00:00:13.469> don't<00:00:13.679> ride<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.460> typically<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.910> write

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we don't ride but typically we write

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.970 
we don't ride but typically we write
every<00:00:15.660> day<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.199> get<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> morning

really<00:00:19.230> nice<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> iOS<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.460> tell<00:00:20.670> you

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
really nice at the iOS I can tell you

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.790 
really nice at the iOS I can tell you
then<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.449> got<00:00:21.600> riding<00:00:22.020> every<00:00:22.260> day<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
then we got riding every day and do the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.769 
then we got riding every day and do the
most<00:00:22.980> important<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.630> have

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
most important thing first then we have

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.200 
most important thing first then we have
some<00:00:25.019> form<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> recovery<00:00:25.949> after<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
some form of recovery after that and the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
some form of recovery after that and the
AIS<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.869> course<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.710> nice<00:00:28.830> cold

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
AIS of course has really nice cold

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.500 
AIS of course has really nice cold
plunge<00:00:29.429> pools<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> guys<00:00:30.240> get

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
plunge pools where the guys get

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.139 
plunge pools where the guys get
refreshed<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:30.960> ready<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.669> theory

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
refreshed and ready to go some theory

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
refreshed and ready to go some theory
some<00:00:33.600> physical<00:00:33.989> training<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.559> might<00:00:34.829> be

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
some physical training which might be

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340 
some physical training which might be

biking road cycling canoeing there's a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
biking road cycling canoeing there's a
lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> different<00:00:40.200> variations<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.219> then

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
lot of different variations there then

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
lot of different variations there then
we<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.450> theory<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> night

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we have more theory in the night

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
we have more theory in the night
typically<00:00:43.950> around<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> set<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.300> own

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.360 

well<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.740> ten<00:01:13.190> day<00:01:13.340> camp<00:01:13.670> at<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.060> iOS<00:01:15.370> the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
well it's a ten day camp at the iOS the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.600 
well it's a ten day camp at the iOS the
gauley<00:01:16.640> runs<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.870> lot<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.470> lot<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.490> kids

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
gauley runs and a lot of a lot of kids

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.190 
gauley runs and a lot of a lot of kids
come<00:01:19.790> down<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.120> i<00:01:20.240> think<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.540> like<00:01:20.660> 15<00:01:21.020> guys

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
come down and i think is like 15 guys

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.740 
come down and i think is like 15 guys
here<00:01:21.950> riding<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.150> know<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.510> learn

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
here riding and you know we just learn

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.200 
here riding and you know we just learn
about<00:01:24.050> all<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.620> off<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.370> bike<00:01:25.520> training<00:01:25.850> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
about all the off the bike training and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.230 
about all the off the bike training and
nutrition<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.620> then<00:01:28.610> we<00:01:28.730> go<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> tracks

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
nutrition and then we go to the tracks

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.110 
nutrition and then we go to the tracks
and<00:01:29.480> go<00:01:29.720> riding<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.430> yeah<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.580> know<00:01:31.640> do<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.910> lot

and go riding and yeah you know do a lot

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.810 
and go riding and yeah you know do a lot
of<00:01:32.210> different<00:01:32.240> formats<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.490> know<00:01:34.580> learn

I come here not only for 2012 but it's a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
I come here not only for 2012 but it's a
really<00:02:05.369> big<00:02:05.609> stepping-stone<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.390> year<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
really big stepping-stone this year so I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.719 
really big stepping-stone this year so I
can<00:02:07.049> go<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.320> under-19s<00:02:07.829> neck<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.580> have

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
can go into under-19s neck here and have

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059 
can go into under-19s neck here and have
a<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:09.030> year<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.300> yeah<00:02:10.080> try<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.860> well

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
a good year and yeah try to do well

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.910 
a good year and yeah try to do well
first<00:02:11.250> year<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.170> probably<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> cycling

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
first year in probably all the cycling

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.990 
first year in probably all the cycling
and<00:02:14.069> paddling<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.550> stuff<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.879> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and paddling and stuff like that like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.729 
and paddling and stuff like that like
I'm<00:02:15.300> fine<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.690> writing<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.290> that's<00:02:16.500> all<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
I'm fine with writing but that's all the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.190 
I'm fine with writing but that's all the
stuff<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.610> gives<00:02:18.299> you<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.510> hard<00:02:18.750> yards<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
stuff that gives you the hard yards on a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.530 
stuff that gives you the hard yards on a
motorbike<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.860> guess<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.940> benefited<00:02:21.390> me

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
motorbike so I guess it's benefited me

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.140 
motorbike so I guess it's benefited me
the<00:02:21.870> best<00:02:22.049> end<00:02:22.349> should<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:22.950> good<00:02:23.099> well<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the best end should be good well the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.820 
the best end should be good well the
camp<00:02:24.360> actually<00:02:24.720> started<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.319> development

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
camp actually started as a development

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.610 
camp actually started as a development
camp<00:02:26.099> oh<00:02:26.340> ma<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.420> galli<00:02:27.780> got<00:02:28.019> together<00:02:28.170> and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
camp oh ma and galli got together and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.930

they<00:02:28.680> were<00:02:29.099> they<00:02:29.340> were<00:02:29.400> trying<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.730> develop

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
they were they were trying to develop

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.699 
they were they were trying to develop
the<00:02:30.150> sport<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.569> develop<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.140> grassroot<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the sport and develop the grassroot to

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.729
