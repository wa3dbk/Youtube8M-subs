00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.950
 and 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:09.170
 equal to all simple welcome guy 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.639
 We came up with another online combat and I continue 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.710
 playing as a first multiple while 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.900
 that deserved for making me the second 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.150
 multi new study restructuring what 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.650
 you know already which I already have very little 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.359
 more determined for the second team but 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.160
 meanwhile I wanted to play in the 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.960
 first since I made the monkey 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.570
 type 7 that we are with the team we are 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.730
 I also had not played much with him and 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.199
 this combat is cool a lot because it 's 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.880
 something there is a pokémon like I do not 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.280
 we had seen well from my first team 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.559
 which this combat stands out pretty 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.300
 apart from the most excellent minus you that already 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.100
 you know that I team leader of the first 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.719
 leader's team and I have a lot 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.370
 honey, so I hope you enjoy the 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.440
 fight because I loved it let's go 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.149
 there decided to start with less than 1000 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.640
 team jr obviously because the rival 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.440
 it leaves me the advantage of its pokemon of 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.090
 know that I can plant the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.520
 barriers even though I have opposite me 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.649
 attacked ninja he withdrew it and I was already 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.260
 giving a turn you know that by changing 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.789
 pokemon safe to change safe and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 sure to kill the rival not 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.729
 change because the gift is shifts 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.710
 fixed here gave me a turn-in element 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.780
 Thunder wave I have already made one and 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 almost that dragon climb game is not going 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.310
 no more if it's not going to be the same since 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.960
 implanted reflexes I already have a bit of his 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.150
 paralyzed and reflexes stuck in the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.590
 battlefield for my favor and he is 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.330
 rigged will be giving me another turn 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.560
 fix the change what what has 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.909
 passed to the rival 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.800
 I'm going to raise another screen was in 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.780
 the light screen and I already have defense 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.190
 physical has risen to 50% and defense 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.479
 special raised to 50% 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.220
 strike this section here I have to 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.479
 I have to admit that I have a little 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.950
 of luck because two consecutive shifts 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.440
 paralyzed is a bit lucky and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 over element a psychic not because 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.680
 is going to be very effective not because I'm going 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.720
 to do and vote third turn it seems to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.970
 this is already maximum luck by three tones 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.500
 you look incredibly lucky but you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.750
 I make a psychic to break the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.399
 compensation skill so I know that the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.679
 next attack that is very effective 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.300
 to remove a lot of life insurance 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.729
 three turns paralyzed good luck 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.920
 I recognize but here you like it a lot 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.060
 the action must and I have bitter ex pulling 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.770
 the battlefield with the screens 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.390
 tucked in and an avalanche is going to be 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.800
 demolishing because he no longer has the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.200
 compensation skill that makes the 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.000
 opponent's attack cut it in half 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.580
 always with suspense to the maximum 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.410
 that's why that psychic dm ostick away and 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.880
 let's face something night apart paralyzing 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.970
 is to continue with the kneecap that skill and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.400
 with an avalanche of safe wax marc 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.050
 at the time that ninja uses to scald and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.330
 you know that this is going to be enough for 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.700
 love handsome earth type and a mascletà 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.210

 If I had not called, I would not have killed 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.670
 To be sold assured used again

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.980
 water type remember is in water type with 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.810

 be very strong, I have all six 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.450
 stuck in special attack but in life 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.360
 and in physical defense 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 above the screens have left the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.739

 mega venus now there is little is good 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.790
 know that they are fed game which 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.470
 do not mega evolve and this one is going to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.780
 be less megabonds to the field of 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.069
 battle and I is no longer the work that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.290
 I had to do ostick I'm still alive 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.209
 so we paralyze it to give it to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.739
 mega good used for the same so that 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.959
 my next pokemon has the field of 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.299
 battle holds the battle easier 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.370
 to gain useful and livestock nothing happens to me 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.290
 like quiet solution space and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.910
 now I have to put the screen of 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.950

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.060
 so also I do not care because I 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.280
 Austin is already done his job 10 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.380
