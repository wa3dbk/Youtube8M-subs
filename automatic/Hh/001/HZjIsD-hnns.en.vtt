work can improve I think that is the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.860 
work can improve I think that is the
heart<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.489> makes<00:03:35.700> theater<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.360> exciting

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
heart of what makes theater so exciting

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.590 
heart of what makes theater so exciting
is<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.380> it's<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.800> collaboration<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.390> think

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
is that it's a collaboration and I think

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.330 
is that it's a collaboration and I think
sometimes<00:03:39.930> people<00:03:40.019> start<00:03:40.560> off<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
sometimes people start off in the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.009 
sometimes people start off in the
