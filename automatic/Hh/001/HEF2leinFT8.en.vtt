00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.000 
I first tried installing the mod I found
the<00:00:15.630> instructions<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.410> difficult<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the instructions really difficult to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
the instructions really difficult to
follow<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> try<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.690> make<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
follow so I'm going to try and make this

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
follow so I'm going to try and make this
as<00:00:19.230> simple<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.619> possible<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.340> guys<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
as simple as possible for you guys and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
as simple as possible for you guys and
I'm<00:00:21.510> also<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> assume<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.560> have

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I'm also going to assume that you have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
I'm also going to assume that you have
at<00:00:22.769> least<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.039> basic<00:00:23.160> understanding<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
at least a basic understanding of how to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
at least a basic understanding of how to
install<00:00:24.600> mods<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> tell

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
install mods like I'm not going to tell

install mods like I'm not going to tell
you<00:00:26.730> where<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.300> folders<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you where all your folders are and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.750 
you where all your folders are and
everything<00:00:28.289> because<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:29.130> sure<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.490> say

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
everything because I'm sure we all say

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
everything because I'm sure we all say
things<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.119> different<00:00:30.330> locations<00:00:30.900> anyway<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
things in different locations anyway so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770
