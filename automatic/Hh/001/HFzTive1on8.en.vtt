is<00:00:07.740> pretty<00:00:08.040> boring<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.610> thought<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.120> was<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> new

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
is pretty boring I thought it was a new

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
monarchy gun at first but that's not the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.470 
monarchy gun at first but that's not the
important<00:00:12.120> part

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
important part

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299 
important part
almost<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.049> shots<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.769> missed<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> target

useful<00:00:16.710> why<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> gun<00:00:18.270> kicks<00:00:18.900> it

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
useful why because the gun kicks it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.830 
useful why because the gun kicks it
kicks<00:00:19.770> like<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> wild<00:00:20.699> stallion<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.630> need

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
kicks like a wild stallion so you need

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.269 
kicks like a wild stallion so you need
this<00:00:21.990> perk<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.039> helpful

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this perk so it's not really helpful

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.759
