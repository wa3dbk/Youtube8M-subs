was pretty fast for a fucking fat man I
think<00:01:39.160> they<00:01:39.250> could<00:01:39.369> have<00:01:39.460> tightened<00:01:39.790> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
think they could have tightened the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.310 
think they could have tightened the
controls<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.360> little<00:01:40.600> bit<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.930> made<00:01:41.050> him<00:01:41.170> move

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
controls a little bit and made him move

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.980 
controls a little bit and made him move
a<00:01:41.470> little<00:01:41.649> slower<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.970> basic<00:01:43.330> control<00:01:43.720> scheme

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.380 
a little slower the basic control scheme
is<00:01:44.140> pretty<00:01:44.380> easy<00:01:44.649> though<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.910> directional

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
is pretty easy though the directional

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.530 
is pretty easy though the directional

need<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.680> many<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> biggest<00:02:34.510> problems

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
need so many one of the biggest problems

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.390 
need so many one of the biggest problems
with<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.110> game<00:02:35.350> though<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> screen

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
with this game though is that the screen

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.039 
with this game though is that the screen
doesn't<00:02:36.760> give<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.970> enough<00:02:37.209> room<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.570> see<00:02:37.780> when

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
doesn't give you enough room to see when

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.590 
doesn't give you enough room to see when
you<00:02:38.140> move<00:02:38.290> ahead<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.820> very<00:02:39.940> easy<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.450> run

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
you move ahead so it's very easy to run

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.470 
you move ahead so it's very easy to run
into<00:02:40.840> enemies<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.440> take<00:02:41.590> cheap<00:02:41.920> hits<00:02:42.480> this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
into enemies and take cheap hits this

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.319 
into enemies and take cheap hits this
shit<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.110> ridiculous<00:02:45.000> why<00:02:46.000> can't<00:02:46.209> they

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
shit is so ridiculous why can't they

shit is so ridiculous why can't they
Center<00:02:46.660> Santa<00:02:47.019> Clause<00:02:47.260> more<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.769> allow<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
see ahead further simple shit like this

see ahead further simple shit like this
and<00:02:51.670> they<00:02:52.300> can't<00:02:52.569> do<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:53.250> along<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.370> these

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
and they can't do it along with these

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.480 
and they can't do it along with these
issues<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.239> gameplay<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.720> too<00:02:56.020> dull<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.500> easy

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
issues the gameplay is too dull and easy

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.360 
issues the gameplay is too dull and easy
you<00:02:57.640> go<00:02:57.880> around<00:02:58.050> defeat<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.230> enemies<00:02:59.620> collect

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
you go around defeat the enemies collect

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.280 
you go around defeat the enemies collect
the<00:03:00.520> presents<00:03:00.940> they<00:03:01.030> leave<00:03:01.210> behind<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.900> move

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the presents they leave behind and move

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.310 
the presents they leave behind and move
on<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.740> next<00:03:02.950> level<00:03:03.570> even<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> bosses<00:03:04.960> are

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
on to the next level even the bosses are

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.860 
on to the next level even the bosses are
too<00:03:05.470> frigging<00:03:05.860> easy<00:03:06.300> plus<00:03:07.300> there's<00:03:07.510> no<00:03:07.540> time

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
too frigging easy plus there's no time

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.500 
too frigging easy plus there's no time
limit<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.410> there's<00:03:08.560> no<00:03:08.650> sense<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.040> tension

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
limit so there's no sense of tension

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.970 
limit so there's no sense of tension
which<00:03:10.510> might<00:03:10.690> not<00:03:10.810> be<00:03:10.990> so<00:03:11.230> bad<00:03:11.470> if<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.710> game

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
which might not be so bad if the game

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.460 
which might not be so bad if the game
weren't<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.340> easy<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.820> cheap<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:14.290> only

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
weren't so easy and cheap the only

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.050 
weren't so easy and cheap the only
reason<00:03:14.830> why<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.010> game<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.490> hard<00:03:15.670> is

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
reason why this game is so hard is

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.580 
reason why this game is so hard is
because<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> screwed-up<00:03:16.930> perspective

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
because of the screwed-up perspective

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.130 
because of the screwed-up perspective
and<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.830> slippery<00:03:18.280> controls<00:03:18.900> after<00:03:19.900> only<00:03:20.050> a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
and the slippery controls after only a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140 
and the slippery controls after only a
few<00:03:20.230> levels<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.310> really<00:03:21.520> bored<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
few levels I got really bored with the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.990 
few levels I got really bored with the
game<00:03:22.680> even<00:03:23.680> changing<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.040> difficulty<00:03:24.700> level

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
game even changing the difficulty level

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.430 
game even changing the difficulty level
to<00:03:25.120> hard<00:03:25.360> didn't<00:03:25.780> make<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.990> that<00:03:26.080> much<00:03:26.290> more

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
to hard didn't make it that much more

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.070 
to hard didn't make it that much more
difficult<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.030> decided<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> use<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.690> level

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
difficult so I decided to use a level

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.810 
difficult so I decided to use a level
select<00:03:29.410> code<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.860> see<00:03:30.040> if<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.250> game<00:03:30.460> got<00:03:30.670> any

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
select code to see if the game got any

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.150 
select code to see if the game got any
harder<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.450> more<00:03:31.570> interesting<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.950> while<00:03:33.130> I

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
harder and more interesting and while I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040 
harder and more interesting and while I
did<00:03:33.460> get<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.640> little<00:03:33.940> bit<00:03:34.060> harder<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.720> certainly

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
did get a little bit harder it certainly

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.560 
did get a little bit harder it certainly
didn't<00:03:35.320> get<00:03:35.440> any<00:03:35.560> more<00:03:35.770> interesting<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.570> fact

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
didn't get any more interesting in fact

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.060 
didn't get any more interesting in fact

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
this Santa Claus pinhead from Hellraiser

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.309 
this Santa Claus pinhead from Hellraiser
I<00:06:33.299> suppose<00:06:34.299> if<00:06:34.479> you<00:06:34.569> have<00:06:34.689> nothing<00:06:34.869> better<00:06:35.169> to

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
I suppose if you have nothing better to

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.249 
I suppose if you have nothing better to
do<00:06:35.499> on<00:06:35.649> Christmas<00:06:35.799> you<00:06:36.279> could<00:06:36.579> play<00:06:36.819> this<00:06:36.999> game

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
do on Christmas you could play this game

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.049 
do on Christmas you could play this game
but<00:06:38.259> even<00:06:38.529> then<00:06:38.769> I'm<00:06:38.979> not<00:06:39.009> sure<00:06:39.309> it's<00:06:39.429> worth<00:06:39.489> it

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:40.059 
but even then I'm not sure it's worth it

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:42.600 
but even then I'm not sure it's worth it
it's<00:06:40.839> long<00:06:41.199> dull<00:06:41.589> and<00:06:41.799> repetitive<00:06:41.889> and<00:06:42.489> it

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
it's long dull and repetitive and it

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.609 
it's long dull and repetitive and it
really<00:06:42.789> doesn't<00:06:43.149> have<00:06:43.269> a<00:06:43.299> lot<00:06:43.539> to<00:06:43.689> offer<00:06:46.499> so<00:06:47.499> in

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:47.619 
really doesn't have a lot to offer so in

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.559 
really doesn't have a lot to offer so in
conclusion<00:06:47.829> I<00:06:48.429> suggest<00:06:48.939> giving<00:06:49.119> this<00:06:49.329> game<00:06:49.509> a

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
conclusion I suggest giving this game a

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.689 
conclusion I suggest giving this game a
pass<00:06:49.929> unless<00:06:50.889> there's<00:06:51.219> somebody<00:06:51.550> out<00:06:51.669> there

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:51.699
