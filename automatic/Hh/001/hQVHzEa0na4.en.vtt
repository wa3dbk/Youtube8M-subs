00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.180
 Japan initially and then it was exported 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.709
 to europe so a lot of people here in 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.709
 america latin may not know it 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.600
 let's see a little bit of what it is 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.939
 he keeps some very entertaining that he had 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.090
 campaign is really playing dice 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.040
 the best thing that can happen to you in the year 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 2017 humanity faces a great 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.219
 threat 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 large alien dishes appear in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.930
 the sky and attack us without warning and did not swim 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.340
 All communication we made to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.320
 paint giant form of life attacked and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.900
 they were called giants 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.430
 they came down from the saucers and humanity 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.860
 joined in resistance 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.140
 the size is very long and horrible but the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.990
 humanity finally succeeded 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.240
 destroying the enemy mother ship and the 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.550
 invaders withdrew 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.350
 peace was restored in 2018 force 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.070
 of terrestrial defense was formed in 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.480
 the same year with a committee noted 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.000
 establish a world government one 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.190
 special a special unit called the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.380
 penguins were also formed and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.689
 wounded 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 but from the center of the earth something 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.140
 appeared in 2019 terror attacks from 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.600
 new 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.550
 a person called emergency from 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.750
 London 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.170
 once again the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.690
 giant the earth was infested and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.950
 here we start the game and we choose the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.540
 different campaigns with the moment 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.550
 we have only the first 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.630
 in the second we can choose between 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.789
 fairway and infantry that are optical 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.770
 of character with which we can play and 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.890
 then we have two types of weapons with the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.290
 that we can count on in order to defeat 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.570
 the aliens 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.390
 so without saying more we are going to 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 start with the first scene we have 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.650
 many difficulties to be able to finish 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.179
 the game completely we need 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.890
 finish it in all the difficulties with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.430
 the two types of characters with what 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430
 we can play 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.840
 hell is really hell 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.990
 it's impossible to pass but well we're going to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 start with normal which is the one that 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.610
 more can be mastered so far 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.010
 so to play has been said 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.190
 we have the two weapons as I said in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.570
 this case I have equipped 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.900
 We can not find more types of 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.900
 weapons 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.819
 in this desired home we have 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.769
 only 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.769
 say that as in the giants 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.920
 and we also have 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.020
 I had sugar 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.450
 those who smell on Wednesday 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:04.410
 it's the most fun I can apart from 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 it's all hard night for people who 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.640
 we do not have limited what we what 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.380
 we have a recharge time that 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.380
 We're running out of gun bullets 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.650
 so to speak, we can be condemned 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.040
 there are few weapons that are effective 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.040
 very long recharge time other weapons 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.520
 we can jump and also take care of what 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.520
 is the com 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.840
 and basically in the area of ​​those of the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.819
 insects 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 in this first song the insects that 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.190
 may appear many types of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 different wines and also keep 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.190
 certain injuries on each screen 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.549
 but the funniest thing is to do it 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.400
 necklaces but we also have micro 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.860
 feet 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.740
 in armaments on stage like the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.320
 that all these are going 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.740
 the buckingham palace and level of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.740
 grease 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:26.290
 this kind of letting the armor goes 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.000
 increasing the maximum life amount 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.740
 what we have afterwards we have kits that we 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.330
 they prepare the energy and there are others 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.380
 green lockers that there is none for 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.390
 here for now 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.730
 they give us the different weapons that we are going to 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.740
 be able to choose later with I think 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.350
 building simply because it could be 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.560
 We see this gate 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.650
 and how we are getting 32 points 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.420
 reds that we see on the radar are the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.250
 enemies the green dots are the quotes 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.120
 we have to grab the points 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.850
 blue are the different 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.590
 tanks or motorcycles or helicopters we are going to 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.210
 can also find what we have in 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.580
 every scene 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.860
 and when white dots are civil what 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.330
 they will not bother us at all radial 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.900
 we can shoot with the way of death 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.419
 we finished the screen of this game 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.070
 the first scenario and I will be 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.990
 leaving over here I'm going to upload more parts 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.550
 the brief because the truth is a game 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.479
 It's really worth it if you can 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.160
 see it and play it forward because it's 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.160
 excellent we 're going to the next
