that<00:05:20.290> I<00:05:20.320> mean<00:05:20.620> it's<00:05:20.980> just<00:05:21.220> amazing<00:05:21.520> what

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
that I mean it's just amazing what

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.880 
that I mean it's just amazing what
happened<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:24.130> know<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.790> last<00:05:25.440> 30<00:05:26.440> years<00:05:26.560> or
