00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.089

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.890
 the most common round neck 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.349
 there is enough fabric for a dress of 44 sizes 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.199
 I recommend a light viscose kroshevo 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.750
 large weaving with a beautiful edge of the form 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.820

 we will be manual as the texture is circling 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 loose tender better shoulder seams 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
