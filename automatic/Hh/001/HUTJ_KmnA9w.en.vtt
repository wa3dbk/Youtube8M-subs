00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.770
 greetings to the twitterers in this short 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.759
 video let's make a simple 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.040
 Demonstration of how to install easily 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.999
 the clutch softener kit here 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.430
 we have a 2011 twingo of 16 valves what 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.650
 first we have to do in these 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 models is to remove the filter box since 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.390
 in the model 8 valve do not do not bring it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.980
 then it is much simpler 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.980
 loosening the clamp a little 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.329
 we remove the hose that comes from the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.839
 Carter gases 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.699
 we remove the vent from the box this 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.449
 hose that comes here that comes from the can 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.449
 integrates the engine 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.960
 we put some pressure 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.550
 we remove the inlet hose 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.090
 and here we have facebook 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.090
 I've thrown myself 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.710
 this time we have our own 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.479
 design 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.799
 very robust very aesthetic functional 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.080
 guaranteed at very low cost for 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.370
 who want to buy it with us 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.610
 the first thing we have to identify 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.430
 is where we are going to work here we have the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.790
 already clutch water we have the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 hairpin and the base the procedure is 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.770
 very easy 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.530
 guaya remove the fork is 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.030
 very easy 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 we removed it from the base 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.870
 we remove the footprint from the base that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.420
 we have the footprint 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.340
 we make a clarification the twingo handles 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.040
 a ratchet on the inside that's why 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.740
 this pressure feels the pressure of 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.210
 lever spring forward let's go to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.160
 explain what is the benefit of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.160
 install this type of smoothing 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.850
 then we are going to 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.890
 to proceed to install the lever the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.610
 right side platen 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.140
 now we have removed the nut 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.740
 we have a very strong washer of 5 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.080
 millimeters the stage just needs one 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.670
 five-eighths key for your 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.740
 installation because the system was 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.170
 designed in this case so that the head 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.330
 of the screw do not turn then only 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.330
 we need to install the stage 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.150
 we put the washer we adjust the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.840
 nut we take it to the top and follow the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.840
 process 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.860
 we install the stage 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.430
 we put the washer 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.330
 we screw the nut in the hand 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.190
 we are on top 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.870
 later we adjust it 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.090
 now we have the stage 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.819
 that goes in the fork between systems 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.830
 very simple we only introduce in the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.870
 rubber 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.790
 in a slight pressure here and adjust 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.360
 with our left hand that is a lot 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.360
 easier 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.980
 in rock we use the nut 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.980
 the idea is to take it to the top with your hand 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.190
 but with a little patience for the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.720
 discomfort of I have to be self 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.720
 Compact do not have much space 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.120
 there we have installed our softener 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.120
 clutch 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.670
 now with the 5th key 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.780
 we started to adjust 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.540
 we are firmly adjusting in the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.540
 last setting for firm turning 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.930
 here the stage of the 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:27.810
 fork now let's copy 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.810
 the base plate of the water already 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.290
 we hit firm 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.190
 and just need to put the water and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.600
 the preventive maintenance of water and 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.150
 of the five we remove the rubber here 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.810
 with a one disposable syringe 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.080
 we apply lubricating oil for more 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.080
 smoothness 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.100
 the installation is very simple just 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.100
 we passed 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.780
 the water already through the hole in the base 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.889
 and we hit the rubber 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.449
 and we were 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.449
 and the water already 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.160
 and there we have our keys installed 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.969
 clutch warmer was very simple 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.459
 You can do it yourselves 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:30.459
 just need to press several times 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:30.459
 Ratchet clutch charging and ready 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.830
 hope has been useful video and 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:51.520
 for those who are interested in 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:55.530
 acquire it can not contact 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.530
 at the end of the page we leave the data
