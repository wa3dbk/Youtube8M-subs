00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.049
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.270
 I bring you a tweet that they really have 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.130
 to have on their devices and it's called 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.240
 slow mode 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.369
 we can find this tweet 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.500
 completely free on the net or the big 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.660
 box so we will not have to add 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.449
 no repo and we will not have to pay 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.460
 absolutely nothing good this tweet us 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.350
 will help simulate slow motion 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.269
 of iphone 5 s on devices 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.960
 earlier here tells us that if we have 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.910
 an iphone 44 sp2 or ipad 3 we are not going to 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.280
 can record at 60 frames per second 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 we're only going to be able to record 30 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 frames per second and if you have a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.510
 iphone 5 an ipad mini ipad mini 2 ipad and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.200
 ipad 4 you can record at 60 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.129
 frames per second comes out good 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.140
 pretty father the iphone 5 s record at 120 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.960
 frames per second the quality is 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.869
 incredibly good is tremendous with the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.300
 60 frames per second is not bad 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.830
 Quality is a decent quality as for 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.660
 be kidding for a while because to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.850
 your friends to be playing for a while 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.710
 true that it is very very very very well and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.390
 well once installed the only one that 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.840
 we have to do is go to adjustments and 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.539
 we go 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.640
 the tab of slow mo here we will be able to 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.380
 modify the frames per second that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.729
 we want you to move me out here 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.950
 no longer modify anything done not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.750
 modify anything this option you can 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 do the same or start moving him and 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.829
 play a little bit good we go to the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.140
 camera and we will be able to see that already 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.899
 we have here what it says slow motion 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.850
 We have video photo 1.1 and the option of 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.770
 panoramic but we are interested in 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.600
 slow motion if we see here we are going to 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.579
 come out we have 60 frames per 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.469
 second or that we are starting to record 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.569
 at 60 frames per second we can 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.899
 record horizontally or we can 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.789
 so this record to last 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.369
 we can see without any problem 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.219
 to record in landscape shape look I'm going to 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.530
 start recording but this good if 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.270
 let's start recording I do not know here in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.170
 the keyboard nothing better here from the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.720
 hearing aids like that so like that a little bit is 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.460
 so here here and here here and here and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.010
 we hope good 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.170
 I can not show you the reel right now 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 because if I put in a good one I'm going to put 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 that they see the screen is going to be 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.520
 completely in black look no me 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.410
 let reproduce what is the mode of 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.930
 airplay does not let me 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.970
 I do not know unfortunately he does not leave me but 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.610
 to see the camera fast the camera 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.070
 slow forgiveness just give play to your 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.320
 video that you just made and super easy 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.440
 it's going to be very intuitive you can cut or 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.300
 you can lengthen the slow motion mode 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.480
 that you want as I say is very 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.250
 intuitive you will not miss or anything 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.110
 the style so good friends then 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.270
 I wish you liked this little video 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.590
 it's a tweet that I liked a lot and 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 well I think that right now at the end of 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.240
 video I leave you a small click a small 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.070
 engraved clip with iphone 5 with this 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.510
 tweet so you can see more or less how 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.220
 It works so well, well, if it has 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.140
