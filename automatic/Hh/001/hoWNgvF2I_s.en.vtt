00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello as they are today I'm going to 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.219
 show or I'll give you ideas of how 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.529
 decorate a picture a frame for photos 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.359
 fun the theme we chose was 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.550
 Alice in Wonderland ' 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.429
 For this decorative painting we are going to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 need a recycled cardboard of the size 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.690
 that you want to make your picture 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
 and objects for 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.710
 and decorate it in this case we 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 we chose the theme of 'Alice in the country 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 of wonders' but it can be with 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
 any subject that they will make their 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.650
 Party can be for the farewell wedding 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.340
 as a child party as for 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.530
 any good occasion we started 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.330
 we paint the picture in color 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.460
 blue but you can paint not in 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.070
 any color we did it so that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 the video is spread as long as it dried 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.720
 we give them start decorating it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 use that crepe paper to get 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.630
 inside around around the contour 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.410
 of the frame 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.640
 let's stick with the silicone gun 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.710
 can use any kind of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.909
 glue that have 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.920
 we are using that because 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.079
 until we make the video is faster 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.219
 but you can use use any 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.219
 glue that has 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.900
 now let's start to paste all the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.690
 shoulders 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.140
 ornaments that we have to decorate our 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.490
 framework 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 let's hit 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.400
 this is just an idea of how 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.250
 power 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.120
 It is a framework for taking pictures 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.120
 funny 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.320
 You can also customize the frame with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 the name of the one celebrated in this 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.980
 occasion we are going to celebrate our 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 my niece's birthday I complied in 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.060
 the same month and we will customize the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.060
 frame with names 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.190
 in my blog I will not leave the molds 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.040
 the molds but the drawings that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.709
 We use to remove all the ornaments 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.510
 we print in black and white and the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.569
 we paste on a cartonboard so that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.530
 were firmer and we painted them with 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.099
 acrylic paints and we emphasize with 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.099
 black marker 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.120
 to stick the cup 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.120
 let's cut with a razor 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.100
 of the cardboard to put the saucer and 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.090
 that is already 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.090
 why are you 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.189
 and the house is stuck 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.569
 and so we do with the other fats 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.569
 that we are going to hit the grain 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.260
 that's how we left the table frame 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.799
 to take funny pictures I hope they 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.900
 have liked this tutorial and they are 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.250
 utility as always I remind you that 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.980

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.690

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.510
 I hope and I wait for you in the next 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.970
 tutorial 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.849
 this is another idea we did for a 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.689
 baby shower with jungle theme 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.689
