you disconnect it no water comes out but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.000 
you disconnect it no water comes out but
to<00:01:31.760> connect<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.210> all<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.480> gotta<00:01:32.660> do<00:01:32.900> is<00:01:33.110> just

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
to connect it all you gotta do is just

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.770 
to connect it all you gotta do is just
get<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.280> lined<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:34.970> push<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.480> in<00:01:35.600> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
get it lined up and then push it in and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.730 
get it lined up and then push it in and
then<00:01:36.260> starts<00:01:36.620> running<00:01:36.980> so<00:01:37.520> now<00:01:37.730> we've<00:01:37.910> got

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
then starts running so now we've got

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.050 
then starts running so now we've got
basically<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.160> water<00:01:40.310> running<00:01:40.730> through<00:01:40.940> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
basically the water running through the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.660 
basically the water running through the
tube<00:01:41.300> through<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.260> sawyer<00:01:42.560> filter<00:01:43.100> which<00:01:43.460> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
tube through the sawyer filter which is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.130 
tube through the sawyer filter which is
supposed<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.300> be<00:01:44.360> good<00:01:44.480> up<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.870> million

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
supposed to be good up to a million

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.040 
supposed to be good up to a million
gallons<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:46.790> may<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.120> backwash<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.930> on

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
gallons you may have to backwash it on

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.200 
gallons you may have to backwash it on
occasion<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.130> if<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.370> have<00:01:49.520> sentiments<00:01:50.030> and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
occasion so if you have sentiments and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.000 
occasion so if you have sentiments and
stuff<00:01:50.450> moving<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.870> here<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.440> will<00:01:51.530> filter<00:01:51.890> out

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
stuff moving in here it will filter out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.950 
stuff moving in here it will filter out
that<00:01:52.280> sediment<00:01:52.670> if<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.420> need<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.810> can

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
that sediment if you need you can

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.340 
that sediment if you need you can
backwash<00:01:54.410> it<00:01:54.620> there's<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.920> connector<00:01:55.580> for

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
backwash it there's a connector for

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.250 
backwash it there's a connector for
basically

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
basically

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.120 
basically
in<00:01:59.220> order<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.550> hook<00:01:59.760> up<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.090> hose<00:02:00.330> or<00:02:00.860> your<00:02:01.860> sink

or whatever to push it all out but you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.860 
or whatever to push it all out but you
could<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.370> flip<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.180> around<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
could actually just flip this around and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
back wash it with dirty water because

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
back wash it with dirty water because

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.100 
inexpensive you can get a big jar of it
for<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.270> 12<00:03:04.050> bucks<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.680> it'll<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.340> fill<00:03:05.580> it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
for like 12 bucks and it'll we fill it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.070 
for like 12 bucks and it'll we fill it
easily<00:03:07.110> who<00:03:07.980> knows<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.340> doesn't<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:09.150> play<00:03:09.810> more

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
easily who knows it doesn't me play more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.220 
easily who knows it doesn't me play more
than<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.380> x<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.630> definitely<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
than that x so and you definitely get a

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.140 
than that x so and you definitely get a
different<00:03:13.620> taste<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> water<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
different taste in the water so the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.330 
different taste in the water so the
water<00:03:15.180> has<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> little<00:03:15.780> weird<00:03:16.170> flavor<00:03:16.530> it

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
water has a little weird flavor it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860 
water has a little weird flavor it
tastes<00:03:17.550> much<00:03:17.790> better<00:03:17.850> once<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> goes<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
tastes much better once it goes to that

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.840 
tastes much better once it goes to that
carbon<00:03:19.140> filter<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.980> will<00:03:20.100> take<00:03:20.700> out

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850

will<00:03:25.410> help<00:03:25.560> clean<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.790> great<00:03:27.000> thing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
will help clean that up the great thing

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.090 
will help clean that up the great thing
about<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.570> setup<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.140> know<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.350> comes<00:03:28.860> down

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
about this setup you know you comes down

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.430 
about this setup you know you comes down
to<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.370> clean<00:03:29.700> bag<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.840> that's<00:03:31.050> going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> be

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
to this clean bag so that's going to be

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.380 
to this clean bag so that's going to be
where<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.890> catch<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.220> reservoir<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:33.090> takes

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
where you catch a reservoir it takes

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.870 
where you catch a reservoir it takes
about<00:03:33.510> two<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.019> half<00:03:34.080> minutes<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.790> to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
about two and a half minutes for it to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.570 
about two and a half minutes for it to
go<00:03:36.090> through<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.390> entire<00:03:36.480> process<00:03:37.489> when<00:03:38.489> you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
go through the entire process when you

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.550 
go through the entire process when you
got<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> good<00:03:38.910> flow<00:03:39.209> going<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.410> it's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
got a good flow going on it so it's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.020 
got a good flow going on it so it's
pretty<00:03:40.709> quick<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.400> don't<00:03:41.550> have<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.760> sit<00:03:41.940> there

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
pretty quick you don't have to sit there

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.820 
pretty quick you don't have to sit there
and<00:03:42.090> pump<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.690> stuff<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.380> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.650> just

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
and pump it and stuff you kind of just

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.740 
and pump it and stuff you kind of just
set<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:44.280> let<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.519> go<00:03:44.700> on<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.390> know

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
set it up let it go on you can you know

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.690 
set it up let it go on you can you know
do<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> couple<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.350> things<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.370> four

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
do a couple of things you have four

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.729 
do a couple of things you have four
liters<00:03:48.090> here<00:03:48.420> for<00:03:48.720> leaders<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
liters here for leaders there so the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.280 
liters here for leaders there so the
best<00:03:49.890> thing<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:50.459> you're<00:03:51.030> out<00:03:51.209> camping<00:03:51.959> and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
best thing is if you're out camping and

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.920 
best thing is if you're out camping and
stuff<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.310> run<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.209> once<00:03:54.510> while<00:03:54.780> you're

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
stuff you can run it once while you're

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.540 
stuff you can run it once while you're
down<00:03:55.080> at<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> lake<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.830> stuff<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> can

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
down at the lake and stuff so you can

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.460 
down at the lake and stuff so you can
fill<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:56.910> four<00:03:57.180> liters<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.690> then<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.290> could

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
fill up four liters and then you could

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.229 
fill up four liters and then you could
actually<00:03:58.620> get<00:03:59.100> another<00:03:59.400> four<00:03:59.730> liters<00:04:00.090> of

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
actually get another four liters of

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
actually get another four liters of
dirty<00:04:00.480> water<00:04:00.630> they<00:04:01.019> carry<00:04:01.470> back<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.980> filter

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
dirty water they carry back and filter

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.040 
dirty water they carry back and filter
back<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.700> camp<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.570> they<00:04:03.600> need<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.900> have

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
back at the camp so they need to have

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.860 
back at the camp so they need to have
eight<00:04:04.260> liters

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
eight liters

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.930 
eight liters
after<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.170> camp<00:04:05.409> of<00:04:05.620> water<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:08.260> basically

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
after to camp of water to to basically

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.839 
after to camp of water to to basically

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
hydration pack so if I needed to if I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.560 
hydration pack so if I needed to if I
filled<00:04:22.600> up<00:04:22.720> my<00:04:22.889> bottle<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:24.070> my<00:04:24.910> bottle<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:25.330> here

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
filled up my bottle of my bottle up here

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.150 
filled up my bottle of my bottle up here
with<00:04:25.720> dirty<00:04:25.960> water<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.410> could<00:04:26.590> actually<00:04:26.710> filter

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
with dirty water I could actually filter

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.580 
with dirty water I could actually filter
that<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.750> goes<00:04:29.050> in<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.290> right<00:04:29.410> direction

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590

great little system to set up and go so

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.529 
great little system to set up and go so
I<00:05:13.720> kind<00:05:13.960> develop<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:14.860> myself<00:05:15.490> with<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:16.419> know

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
I kind develop this myself with you know

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.020 
I kind develop this myself with you know
a<00:05:16.900> couple<00:05:17.080> different<00:05:17.530> systems<00:05:18.130> platypus

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
a couple different systems platypus

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330 
a couple different systems platypus
makes<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.360> full<00:05:19.599> system<00:05:20.139> without<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.950> carbon

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
makes a full system without the carbon

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.370 
makes a full system without the carbon
filter<00:05:21.880> they<00:05:22.450> have<00:05:22.539> their<00:05:22.690> own<00:05:22.720> filter

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
filter they have their own filter

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.719 
filter they have their own filter
version<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.800> can<00:05:23.919> get<00:05:24.099> that<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.610> they're

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
version you can get that I think they're

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.820 
version you can get that I think they're
about<00:05:24.880> a<00:05:24.940> hundred<00:05:25.150> nine<00:05:25.419> dollars<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:26.080> like<00:05:26.680> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
about a hundred nine dollars I like the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.000 
about a hundred nine dollars I like the
Sawyer<00:05:27.780> system<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:29.050> i<00:05:29.139> went<00:05:29.320> with<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.770> and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
Sawyer system so i went with that and

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.550 
Sawyer system so i went with that and
then<00:05:30.220> actually<00:05:30.610> got<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.389> connectors<00:05:32.260> court

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
then actually got the connectors court

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.270 
then actually got the connectors court
and<00:05:32.740> then<00:05:32.860> made<00:05:33.190> my<00:05:33.310> own<00:05:33.340> filter<00:05:35.039> if<00:05:36.039> you're

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
and then made my own filter if you're

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.310 
and then made my own filter if you're
interested<00:05:36.820> in<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.150> do-it-yourself<00:05:37.900> filter

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
interested in the do-it-yourself filter

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
it yourself for the filter system so you

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.540 
it yourself for the filter system so you
can<00:05:48.940> create<00:05:49.240> your<00:05:49.360> own<00:05:49.620> it's<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.770> lot<00:05:51.010> nicer<00:05:51.039> so

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
can create your own it's a lot nicer so

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.629 
can create your own it's a lot nicer so
you<00:05:51.940> can<00:05:52.090> just<00:05:52.120> kind<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.570> clean<00:05:53.500> out<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.979> redo

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.310 
you can just kind of clean out and redo
the<00:05:54.760> carbon<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.630> just<00:05:55.810> got<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:56.020> make<00:05:56.080> sure<00:05:56.139> you

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
the carbon you just got to make sure you

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.900 
the carbon you just got to make sure you
keep<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.620> flow<00:05:56.800> in<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:57.010> right<00:05:57.130> direction<00:05:57.280> and
