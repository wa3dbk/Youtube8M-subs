00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
I said we bear floss all you simply do

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.280 
I said we bear floss all you simply do
is<00:04:32.620> take<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:32.950> pop<00:04:33.220> up<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.490> your<00:04:33.610> choice<00:04:38.790> and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
is take a pop up of your choice and

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.620 
is take a pop up of your choice and
literally<00:04:41.290> screw<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.220> bear<00:04:42.400> on

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.470 

they're<00:04:47.590> perfect<00:04:48.100> create<00:04:48.550> give<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.970> rig<00:04:49.210> so

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
they're perfect create give the rig so

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.970 
they're perfect create give the rig so
much<00:04:49.660> movement<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.380> so<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.770> being

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
much movement like so it being

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.520 
much movement like so it being
incorporated<00:04:51.280> not<00:04:51.880> only<00:04:52.210> through<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.350> bait

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
incorporated not only through the bait

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.920 
incorporated not only through the bait
screw<00:04:53.860> but<00:04:54.010> also<00:04:54.220> into<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.760> novel<00:04:54.940> rigging<00:04:55.570> as

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
screw but also into a novel rigging as

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.260 
screw but also into a novel rigging as
soon<00:04:56.110> as<00:04:56.290> that<00:04:56.410> fish<00:04:56.680> touches<00:04:57.670> that<00:04:57.850> corner

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
soon as that fish touches that corner

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.240

the<00:04:58.720> bender<00:04:59.080> obviously<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.010> want<00:05:00.160> is

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
the bender obviously you want is

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.010 
the bender obviously you want is
spinning

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
spinning

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.200 
spinning
that's<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.200> hooking<00:05:02.500> agent<00:05:03.210> absolutely

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
that's the hooking agent absolutely

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.750 
that's the hooking agent absolutely
perfect
