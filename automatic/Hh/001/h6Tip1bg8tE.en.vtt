00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 hello youtubers 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.490
 today we are going to talk about an issue that 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.769
 has nothing to do with the theme of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.840
 channel and are the piercings this video does not 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.820
 is to create debate about whether we should 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.380
 carry piercings or we should not carry 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.090
 piercings the case is that I come to 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.089
 talk about this because I was recently 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.249
 operated on a lump that came to my root 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.560
 of a piercing then I want to tell you 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.630
 my experience because by instagram I put 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.159
 a picture happy is several of you 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.960
 you chose that it would be interesting to do 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.279
 this video so I come to tell you my 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 experience with piercings that 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.449
 piercing was taken as least I've done 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 where I have made them so if you 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.140
 you remove something weird I guess it will be the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.859
 hamster that is rolling things like that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.960
 that right now I have only this piercing 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.600
 which is what is commonly in Spain- 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.640
 he knows him as the dragon and I've had 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.339
 also in this ear above and in the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.469
 another up first in this and then in 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.809
 is where he tells me so good those of 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.390
 above the ears of the tip - 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.950
 says me if I know that I am very crazy if 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 you are thinking what pain 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.560
 in its time I do not remember that it was 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 a lot of pain but do not do it like that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.290
 go to a site that does not do it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.500
 at home and I have to tell you that it was not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 two years it was not six years ago or five 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 in my adolescent stage in which everything 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 the world was doing piercings 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 so I could not be less and the case 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 is that good because I do not know why 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.300
 I took it off but I ended up finishing 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.850
 only with this east of the dragon yes that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.270
 it says it in a specialized center in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.220
 do piercings and tattoos was a center 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 which is on the street montera for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.580
 that 6 from madrid I know it's the place 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.759
 Typical in which everyone is a 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 3.006 or so and it was good it was a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.930
 Well, everything was very clean 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.030
 everything was professional he did very well and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.800
 they explained to you how you had to take care of yourself 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.020
 the piercing I do not remember exactly 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.300
 very well of the care but yes that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 you have to be very careful in 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.399
 the cartilage areas is a scar 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.350
 after all and you have to be very 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.479
 hygienic when caring for the oedt 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.580
 cetera basically I had to throw or 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.820
 betadine or serum 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.010
 every day twice a day and go 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.220
 moving the piercing bit by bit to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.720
 that did not stay stuck to the meat and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.640
 now I'm going to tell you the sides 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.680
 negative of the piercing other than that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.080
 you can get infected you can put together the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.580
 god in your ear or in any area of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 body in which you have the piercing 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.350
 because it is very unpleasant to have something 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.390
 that is constantly hurting you and 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.490
 is infecting you another negative thing of 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.070
 the end feet are the tears and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.460
 if it can happen that they have the piercing 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.830
 in some garment or anywhere and you 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.600
 finish making a piece of meat that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.810
 It's not very usual and it's not because of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.450
 afraid but surely something has gone wrong 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.310
 because I 've listened and third 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.910
 consequence is what has happened to me 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.860
 and I will tell you 6 years ago or 5 years ago 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.040
 I know my piercing here 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.160
 above the ear and what happened that does 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.140
 a year and a half or two that I got a 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.330
 bulbo a little flight that at the beginning was 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.340
 small and I said the same is that it has 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.840
 infected or whatever but from there not 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.120
 it was not even any 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980
 infection and it was well healed like that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.470
 that I found it strange that after 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.510
 four years with a piercing in the fifth 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.849
 year you will get infected because I was 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.920
 healed so I left the little bump and 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.540
 while he was small and did not notice 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.549
 nothing happened but it was growing and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.709
 growing and growing and it seemed that 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.810
 had a leprechaun ear is more I think 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.620
 that in some videos you can see if I 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.629
 I turn this side but I was going too 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.879
 I was already a little tired when I was sleeping 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.459
 this side hurt me I had just crushed 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.900
 etcetera so I decided to go to the doctor myself 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.700
 to all this I thought it was a 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.310
 infection that I had created a 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.620
 you cramped in there with all the crap 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.319
 that there was and when I went to the doctor and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.269
 I taught all that he told me it was usual 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.250
 that people came out in this type 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.220
 of lumps and that those lumps can be 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.069
 two things or an infection that you have 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.069
 created a cyst as I said 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.319
 that your own cartilage was generating 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.939
 more cartilage and how could I not know 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.249
 because it was a pretty big package and not 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.280
 I could open without doing anything because I 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:18.199
 he said look malu you can operate from this 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.509
 and you can remove and at the time 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.330
 the one that we open to you we will know if it is or 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:26.330
 infection or cartilage so the week 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.440
 last yes because this week is not the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.930
 last week on September 23 I 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.610
 they operated to remove that lump and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.919
 when they opened it they discovered that it was 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.169
 cartilage that I had generated because 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.110
 there are certain people who do not heal 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.060
 well and then they generate more cartilage and 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.520
 this area of ​​the ear you have to have 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.620
 very careful because it is a very 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.780
 delicate that if it does not heal well can 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.599
 Generte a bundle as it happened to me 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.419
 in gases that took away the excess that 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.430
 I had cartilage and they put some 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.430
 points that are these from here 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.490
 those threads that are behind that are more 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.680
 large and is a strip of 7 points for 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.750
 back that I will not teach you because it 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.460
 make more grid yet for when 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.080
 you see this video and I will have 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 removed the points so you will be 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.889
 surely very happy and if you stay a 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.810
 little of grilla but it is that it is a 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.910
 consequence that can happen to have a 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.650
 piercing the case is that I tell you all 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.949
 this experience so that you 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.229
 you know there are some risks that good 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.090
 because they do not usually go for example 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.699
 this piercing also there was a site 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.970
 specialized or because I have 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.280
 healed better or whatever it is because no 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.280
 nothing has happened I think I said everything 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.370
 what I had to say if I did not forget 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.990
 of something because I have forgotten if you have 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.880
 some more question to say without being 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.780
 I can solve the same or what do you want? 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.360
 comment 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.470
 commenting down on the comments my 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.389
 social networking is in the box 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.090
 information and if you have any idea of 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:01.830
 video or some comment you can put it

 also because he is always welcome
