you know a cheap way on how to do
extensions<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:19.090> know<00:00:19.570> that<00:00:19.840> usually

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
extensions I know that usually

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.690 
extensions I know that usually
extensions<00:00:20.740> when<00:00:20.890> they<00:00:21.009> come<00:00:21.220> already<00:00:21.430> with

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
extensions when they come already with

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.390 
extensions when they come already with
the<00:00:21.790> clips<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.240> stuff<00:00:22.450> they<00:00:23.410> get<00:00:23.590> tend<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.279> be

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
the clips and stuff they get tend to be

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.910 
the clips and stuff they get tend to be
a<00:00:24.430> little<00:00:24.610> bit<00:00:24.730> more<00:00:25.029> expensive<00:00:25.330> so<00:00:25.840> here<00:00:26.800> it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
a little bit more expensive so here it

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.889 
a little bit more expensive so here it
is<00:00:26.980> usually<00:00:27.759> extensions<00:00:28.329> come<00:00:28.570> out<00:00:28.689> with

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
is usually extensions come out with

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.710 
is usually extensions come out with
pretty<00:00:29.829> much<00:00:30.009> like<00:00:30.220> this<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:30.970> they<00:00:31.360> come<00:00:31.540> out

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
pretty much like this so they come out

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.229 
pretty much like this so they come out
with<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.619> long<00:00:32.829> strands<00:00:33.520> all<00:00:33.820> depending

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
with the long strands all depending

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.120 
with the long strands all depending
there's<00:00:34.420> different<00:00:34.750> sizes<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.260> stuff<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:35.920> and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
there's different sizes and stuff so and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.819 
there's different sizes and stuff so and
they<00:00:37.000> open<00:00:37.360> up<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:37.780> they're<00:00:37.960> not<00:00:38.079> cut<00:00:38.380> up<00:00:38.530> or

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
they open up so they're not cut up or

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.389 
they open up so they're not cut up or
anything<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:40.270> as<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.719> can<00:00:40.899> see<00:00:41.200> like<00:00:42.070> all<00:00:42.219> the

anything so as you can see like all the

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.030 
anything so as you can see like all the
extensions<00:00:42.990> the<00:00:43.990> dimensions<00:00:44.620> all<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:44.920> have

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
extensions the dimensions all you have

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.850 
extensions the dimensions all you have
is<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.250> week<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:46.480> here<00:00:47.170> what<00:00:47.380> I've<00:00:47.500> done<00:00:47.680> I'm

Emma<00:00:52.030> I<00:00:52.210> measured<00:00:52.720> pretty<00:00:52.960> much<00:00:53.200> here<00:00:53.680> in<00:00:53.800> the

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
Emma I measured pretty much here in the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.370 
Emma I measured pretty much here in the
back<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:55.150> head<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.420> did<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:55.750> couple<00:00:55.990> of<00:00:56.200> my

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
back of the head I did a couple of my

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.850 
back of the head I did a couple of my
measurements<00:00:57.100> by<00:00:58.030> doing<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.170> Emma's<00:00:59.740> going

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
measurements by doing so so Emma's going

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.650 
measurements by doing so so Emma's going
to<00:00:59.950> come<00:01:00.130> after<00:01:00.610> it<00:01:00.970> now<00:01:01.150> we're<00:01:01.360> going<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.510> be

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
to come after it now we're going to be

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.720 
to come after it now we're going to be
setting<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.079> up<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.230> I'm<00:01:02.860> actually<00:01:03.190> sewing

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
setting it up so I'm actually sewing

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.979 
setting it up so I'm actually sewing
these<00:01:04.059> things<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.509> what<00:01:04.629> you're<00:01:04.750> going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.930> be

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
these things so what you're going to be

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.620 
these things so what you're going to be
needing<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.680> cut<00:01:05.890> really<00:01:06.250> pretty<00:01:06.549> much<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
needing is to cut really pretty much the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.499 
needing is to cut really pretty much the
width<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.200> your<00:01:09.130> first<00:01:09.700> section<00:01:10.180> which<00:01:10.360> is

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
width of your first section which is

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.149 
width of your first section which is
probably<00:01:10.720> in<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.990> nape<00:01:11.200> area<00:01:11.409> which<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.009> going

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
probably in the nape area which is going

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.219 
probably in the nape area which is going
to<00:01:12.220> be<00:01:12.280> pretty<00:01:12.520> wide<00:01:12.850> now<00:01:13.570> because<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.020> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
to be pretty wide now because of the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.780 
to be pretty wide now because of the
density<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.799> the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
density of the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.140 
density of the
of<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.480> web<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.740> did<00:01:17.980> I<00:01:18.100> doubled<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:18.700> so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
of the web what I did I doubled it up so

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.950 
of the web what I did I doubled it up so
all<00:01:19.930> i<00:01:19.990> did<00:01:20.260> is<00:01:20.470> folded<00:01:21.310> into<00:01:21.460> once<00:01:22.420> i<00:01:22.540> fold<00:01:22.810> it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
all i did is folded into once i fold it

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.350 
all i did is folded into once i fold it
into<00:01:23.200> i<00:01:23.620> could<00:01:24.070> pass<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.310> flat<00:01:24.760> iron<00:01:25.000> so<00:01:25.300> i

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
into i could pass the flat iron so i

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.870 
into i could pass the flat iron so i
really<00:01:25.540> can<00:01:25.780> get<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.050> nice<00:01:26.200> bend<00:01:26.620> on<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.040> so

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
really can get the nice bend on it so

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.480 
really can get the nice bend on it so
now<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.350> first<00:01:29.710> weapon<00:01:29.950> i'm<00:01:30.250> going

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
now here is the first weapon i'm going

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
now here is the first weapon i'm going
to<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.880> showing<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.900> clips<00:01:32.140> on<00:01:32.380> these<00:01:33.040> clips

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to be showing the clips on these clips

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.880 
to be showing the clips on these clips
actually<00:01:34.780> it's<00:01:34.900> eclipse<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.500> can<00:01:35.710> get

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
actually it's eclipse that you can get

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.000 
actually it's eclipse that you can get
you<00:01:36.580> know<00:01:36.610> extension<00:01:37.210> stores<00:01:37.570> or<00:01:38.320> accessories

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
you know extension stores or accessories

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.010 
you know extension stores or accessories
and<00:01:39.280> stuff<00:01:39.400> like<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:40.210> these<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.750> pretty

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
and stuff like that so these are pretty

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.950 
and stuff like that so these are pretty
much<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.229> clips<00:01:41.620> that<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.950> can<00:01:42.490> be<00:01:42.670> using<00:01:43.540> on

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
much the clips that you can be using on

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.469 
much the clips that you can be using on
the<00:01:44.260> wefts<00:01:44.800> just<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:45.910> you'll<00:01:46.090> see<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the wefts just so so you'll see that

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.280 
the wefts just so so you'll see that
there<00:01:46.660> has<00:01:46.890> four<00:01:47.890> holes<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:49.060> them<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.420> that's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
there has four holes in them and that's

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.140 
there has four holes in them and that's
why<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> can<00:01:50.770> pass<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.130> thread<00:01:51.369> needle<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:51.970> it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
why you can pass the thread needle to it

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.450 
why you can pass the thread needle to it
and<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.600> we<00:01:52.750> can<00:01:52.930> really<00:01:53.110> slow<00:01:53.830> things<00:01:54.070> up<00:01:54.250> on

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
and so we can really slow things up on

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.450 
and so we can really slow things up on
it<00:01:54.610> alright<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.750> that's<00:01:55.960> for<00:01:56.200> that<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.920> when

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
it alright so that's for that then when

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.890 
it alright so that's for that then when
i<00:01:57.490> bought<00:01:57.670> about<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> kind<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.360> thread<00:01:58.690> but

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
i bought about a kind of a thread but

taking my extensions now the best thing
is<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.800> do<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.550> really<00:02:37.510> actually<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.530> take<00:02:38.860> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
is to do is really actually to take the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.610 
is to do is really actually to take the
piece<00:02:39.700> where<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:41.019> know<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.379> they're<00:02:41.590> not

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
piece where you know it they're not

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.890 
piece where you know it they're not
bounded<00:02:42.310> we're<00:02:42.489> not<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.819> fold<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.690> is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
bounded we're not the fold is so this is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.660 
bounded we're not the fold is so this is
where<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> fold<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> I'm<00:02:44.860> taking<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.310> piece

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
where the fold is I'm taking this piece

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.390 
where the fold is I'm taking this piece
and<00:02:46.180> I'll<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.629> putting<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:47.019> clip<00:02:47.290> now<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.129> clip

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
right order so if you come and see here

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.980 
right order so if you come and see here
on<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.730> left

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.040 

this<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.890> how<00:03:47.100> it's<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.640> go<00:03:47.780> right<00:03:48.780> down

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
this is how it's going to go right down

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.310 
this is how it's going to go right down
here<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.680> don't<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.130> upside<00:03:50.760> down<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.690> close

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
here so don't do it upside down so close

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.400 
here so don't do it upside down so close
this<00:03:52.700> put<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.790> down<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.480> where<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.900> weft<00:03:55.110> is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
this put it down on to where the weft is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.230 
this put it down on to where the weft is
I'm<00:03:55.860> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.130> try<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.460> really<00:03:56.790> keep<00:03:57.060> it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
I'm going to try and really keep it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.550 
I'm going to try and really keep it
stable<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.440> all<00:03:58.770> see<00:03:59.190> how<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> do<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.600> then

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
stable so you all see how to do it then

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.080 
stable so you all see how to do it then
I<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.160> take<00:04:02.790> my<00:04:03.060> two<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.390> fold<00:04:04.020> my<00:04:04.170> two<00:04:04.320> lines

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I do take my two I fold my two lines

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.080 
I do take my two I fold my two lines
take<00:04:06.090> my<00:04:06.300> cliff<00:04:06.740> put<00:04:07.740> it<00:04:07.890> there<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> then<00:04:08.460> pass

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
take my cliff put it there and then pass

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.880 
take my cliff put it there and then pass
my<00:04:09.450> threat<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.500> what<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.740> could

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
my threat to it know what you could

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.250 
my threat to it know what you could
actually<00:04:11.010> do<00:04:11.430> even<00:04:11.730> more<00:04:11.760> simpler<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.720> pass

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
actually do even more simpler is pass

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.220 
actually do even more simpler is pass
your<00:04:13.590> thread<00:04:13.950> right<00:04:14.220> away<00:04:14.490> through<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:16.170> you

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
your thread right away through it so you

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.590 
your thread right away through it so you
don't<00:04:16.709> have<00:04:17.070> an<00:04:17.310> issue<00:04:17.459> or<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> problem<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
don't have an issue or a problem and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.900 
don't have an issue or a problem and
then<00:04:18.989> while<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.620> had<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:20.040> not<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.700> just

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
then while you had that not that it just

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.000 
then while you had that not that it just
holds<00:04:21.540> then<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.230> can<00:04:22.470> thread<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.980> through

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
holds then you can thread it through

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.430 
holds then you can thread it through
here<00:04:24.650> I'm<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:25.920> not<00:04:26.040> good<00:04:26.250> at<00:04:26.340> sewing<00:04:26.640> so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.390

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
that around there we go so we got that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.280 
that around there we go so we got that
started<00:04:37.540> now<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.710> see<00:04:39.010> here<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:40.900> what

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
started now you see here this is what

so there I'm starting to get a nice
tight<00:04:57.190> feel<00:04:57.670> around<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.840> I'm<00:04:59.260> actually<00:04:59.410> pass

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
tight feel around it I'm actually pass

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.800 
tight feel around it I'm actually pass
it<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.280> hole<00:05:00.460> again<00:05:00.820> if<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.180> want<00:05:01.450> and

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
putting good tension on it and just

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.530 
putting good tension on it and just
sewing<00:05:42.510> about<00:05:43.550> going<00:05:44.550> about<00:05:44.790> it<00:05:45.000> again<00:05:45.270> and

then just pulling it through here boom
there<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.470> go<00:05:49.680> so<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:49.920> really<00:05:50.370> get<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.550> solid

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
there you go so you really get a solid

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.370 
there you go so you really get a solid
stitch<00:05:51.540> on<00:05:52.200> that<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:53.940> with<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.420> Strand<00:05:54.900> about

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
stitch on that so with the Strand about

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.700 
stitch on that so with the Strand about
like<00:05:55.590> this<00:05:56.450> this<00:05:57.450> length<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:58.080> probably<00:05:58.320> put

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
like this this length I probably put

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.760 
like this this length I probably put
three<00:05:59.190> maybe<00:06:00.030> four<00:06:00.450> of<00:06:00.630> them<00:06:00.810> all<00:06:01.320> depending

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
three maybe four of them all depending

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.160 
three maybe four of them all depending
how<00:06:01.890> solid<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.580> want<00:06:02.790> it<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:05.600> do<00:06:06.600> that<00:06:06.810> again

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
how solid you want it so do that again

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.600 
how solid you want it so do that again
here<00:06:08.000> nice<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.030> tight

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610
