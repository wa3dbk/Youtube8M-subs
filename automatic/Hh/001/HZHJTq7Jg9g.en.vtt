00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
not this being a jutsu an ultimate jutsu

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
not this being a jutsu an ultimate jutsu
or<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.469> sort<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> combo<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.730> guess<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> as

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
or some sort of combo my guess is as

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
or some sort of combo my guess is as
good<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.420> yours<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.079> should<00:01:01.739> point<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.100> all

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
good as yours I should point out all

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.700 
good as yours I should point out all
that<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.730> graphics<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.539> these<00:01:04.080> images<00:01:04.500> are

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that the graphics on these images are

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
that the graphics on these images are
really<00:01:05.250> detailed<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.180> hard<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.539> tell<00:01:06.750> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
really detailed so it's hard to tell if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050 
really detailed so it's hard to tell if
these<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.470> ultimate<00:01:08.039> jutsus<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.729> just

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
these are ultimate jutsus or just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.300 
these are ultimate jutsus or just
screenshots<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> high-end<00:01:10.200> PC<00:01:10.650> normally

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
when the models are detailed its most

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
when the models are detailed its most
likely<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.740> ultimate<00:01:14.070> jutsu<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> could<00:01:15.119> be

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
likely an ultimate jutsu but I could be

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
likely an ultimate jutsu but I could be
wrong<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.659> could<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:16.500> looking

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
wrong it could just be the game looking

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.010 
wrong it could just be the game looking
badass<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.180> sorry<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.869> this
