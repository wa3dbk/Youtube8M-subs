00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 this one we have is 2 episode of the sword of the witch 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 they look very good for me 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 so everything is as it should all as a herald even 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 there is an inscription tattoo in my usual 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.860
 Mosque silver was the inscription was 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.010
 inscription 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 also we have clothes it calls 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 night watch meeting 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 the edges of the night watch this and spamming 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 armor the second part of this armor which 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 is given for a collector's edition only 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.340
 slightly repainted originally 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.700
 option was not the same you can 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.200
 choose in rar archive whether to take shield 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.869
 night watch which is here on 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.610
 oddity also exists 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.630
 night watch shield looks like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.450
 not bad but we witch we walk without shields 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.000
 here and also you can clean embed 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 whether here or light or heavy edges 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 it all depends on your 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 characteristics but also weight accordingly 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.650
 armor will be the same 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 and the cost of crafting will also be 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.380
 corresponding let's see our 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.540
 The second set of armor today is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 called boots monster hunter and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.549
 as for me it seems to represent this 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.950
 my ebony character just now noticed 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.430

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.950
 the to looks yes especially on the terrace 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.869
 can be seen called in the hunter's wound 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.380

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.799
 Not bad 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.780
 look further at the level of protection 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.440
 night watch hood 34 just 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.069
 night gloves 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.620
 she protects on 24 boots there is a gap on 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.780
 24 which is the same as the night watch 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.040
 27 please note all pumped 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360
 characteristics to be a little lower 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.079
 cuirass hunter hunters miracle slightly 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.159

 Well, in general, by the way silver sword in 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.859

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.450
