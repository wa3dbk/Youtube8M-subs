00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.690 
something special for the fans what's
new<00:00:45.480> gameplay<00:00:46.079> wise<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:48.620> one<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:50.520> be

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
new gameplay wise so one thing would be

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
new gameplay wise so one thing would be
that<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> new<00:00:51.719> gameplay<00:00:52.079> mechanic

sword<00:00:52.980> fighting<00:00:53.219> actionability<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sword fighting actionability so I think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.560 
sword fighting actionability so I think
what<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> saw<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.039> first<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.550> demo<00:00:56.850> by

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
what you saw in the first look demo by

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
what you saw in the first look demo by
miyazaki<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.109> his<00:00:58.230> presentation<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
miyazaki on his presentation was that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
miyazaki on his presentation was that
there<00:01:00.120> every<00:01:00.660> weapon<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:01.050> its<00:01:01.260> own<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
there every weapon has its own so you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
there every weapon has its own so you
know<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.850> part<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> demo<00:01:03.690> he<00:01:03.930> used<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
know in one part of the demo he used a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
know in one part of the demo he used a
great<00:01:04.559> sword<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> he<00:01:05.640> getting<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> ready

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
great sword and he getting this ready

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
great sword and he getting this ready
stance<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:06.930> he'd<00:01:07.110> flip<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
stance and then he'd flip up the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
stance and then he'd flip up the
opponent<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> end<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> undie<00:01:08.970> heavy

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
opponent in the end the undie heavy

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
opponent in the end the undie heavy
attack<00:01:09.570> obviously<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:10.860> causes<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
attack obviously that also causes you to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
attack obviously that also causes you to
be<00:01:11.880> open<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.780> enemy<00:01:13.049> attacks<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
little bit of a risk reward with that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
little bit of a risk reward with that
but<00:01:15.360> um<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.350> soon<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.590> he<00:01:16.710> showed

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
but um you know as soon as he showed

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.350 
but um you know as soon as he showed
that<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> oohs<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.240> ahhs

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that there was a lot of oohs and ahhs

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.660 
that there was a lot of oohs and ahhs
from<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> audience<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.430> that's<00:01:20.430> definitely

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
from the audience so that's definitely

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.990 
from the audience so that's definitely
one<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> key<00:01:21.210> new<00:01:21.390> things<00:01:21.740> gameplay<00:01:22.740> was

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
one of the key new things gameplay was

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.870 
one of the key new things gameplay was
also<00:01:24.000> expect<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.369> very<00:01:26.369> interconnected

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
also expect to see a very interconnected

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.749 
also expect to see a very interconnected
world<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> anything<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.610> off

in a distance you'll be able to travel

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.460 
in a distance you'll be able to travel
to<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> great<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.320> the

will they stick with that type of
gameplay<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.410> don't<00:02:59.650> think<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.580> in<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.480> know

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
gameplay I I don't think and in you know

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.180 
gameplay I I don't think and in you know
channel<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.080> challenging<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:02.830> at<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> same

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
channel it's challenging but at the same

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.290 
channel it's challenging but at the same
time<00:03:03.430> there's<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.760> great<00:03:03.940> sense<00:03:04.120> of

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
time there's a great sense of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.030 
time there's a great sense of
accomplishment<00:03:04.420> achievement<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.770> think

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
accomplishment achievement and I think

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.910 
accomplishment achievement and I think
that<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.550> one<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.300> hallmark<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.470> know<00:03:08.590> of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
that is one of the hallmark you know of

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.550 
that is one of the hallmark you know of
dark<00:03:09.310> souls<00:03:09.550> series<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:11.020> that's<00:03:11.230> not<00:03:11.320> going
