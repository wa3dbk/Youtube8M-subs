00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
because then all your work is wasted if

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.260 
because then all your work is wasted if
you<00:05:16.950> do<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.610> then<00:05:17.729> you're<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:18.030> oh<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
you do that and then you're like oh I

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.320 
you do that and then you're like oh I
got<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> do<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.930> all<00:05:19.050> over<00:05:19.169> again<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.250> use<00:05:21.030> that

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
got to do it all over again and use that

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.860 
got to do it all over again and use that
much<00:05:21.570> more<00:05:21.960> nail<00:05:22.260> polish<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:27.240> think<00:05:27.570> I<00:05:27.660> got

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
much more nail polish so I think I got

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.790 
much more nail polish so I think I got
my<00:05:28.050> surface<00:05:28.770> relatively<00:05:29.580> clean<00:05:29.910> and<00:05:30.800> I'm

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
my surface relatively clean and I'm

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.980 
my surface relatively clean and I'm
gonna<00:05:32.070> slowly<00:05:32.700> get<00:05:33.330> my<00:05:33.770> more<00:05:34.770> nail<00:05:34.950> polish

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
gonna slowly get my more nail polish

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.960 
gonna slowly get my more nail polish
slowly<00:05:36.990> take<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.470> out

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:50.580 

and<00:05:43.970> I<00:05:44.180> think<00:05:44.240> I<00:05:44.510> got<00:05:44.690> a<00:05:46.480> good<00:05:47.680> see<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:48.860> I

and I think I got a good see that I

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.640 
and I think I got a good see that I
didn't<00:05:51.590> get<00:05:51.830> much<00:05:52.400> of<00:05:52.430> the<00:05:52.820> orange<00:05:53.390> but<00:05:54.320> I<00:05:54.350> did

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
didn't get much of the orange but I did

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.300 
didn't get much of the orange but I did
get<00:05:54.890> a<00:05:55.100> whole<00:05:55.460> bunch<00:05:55.670> of<00:05:55.820> other<00:05:56.150> colors<00:05:56.690> and

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.130 
get a whole bunch of other colors and
I'm<00:05:58.310> just<00:05:58.580> gonna<00:05:58.790> go<00:05:59.180> ahead<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.570> take<00:05:59.780> off<00:05:59.960> my

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off my

decide

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.659 

and<00:06:45.729> there<00:06:45.909> you<00:06:46.029> have<00:06:46.059> it<00:06:46.270> that's<00:06:46.809> the<00:06:47.050> design

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
and there you have it that's the design

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.199 
and there you have it that's the design
help<00:06:48.669> you<00:06:48.819> like<00:06:49.029> this<00:06:49.239> design<00:06:49.629> and<00:06:50.110> I<00:06:51.209> think

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:52.209 
help you like this design and I think

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:53.549 
help you like this design and I think
this<00:06:52.360> one<00:06:52.569> still<00:06:52.779> looks<00:06:53.020> a<00:06:53.169> little<00:06:53.319> better

00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:53.559 
this one still looks a little better

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:56.309 
this one still looks a little better
because<00:06:53.919> it's<00:06:54.279> more<00:06:54.399> like<00:06:54.699> site<00:06:55.029> waste<00:06:55.989> but

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
because it's more like site waste but

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.619 
because it's more like site waste but
this<00:06:56.499> one<00:06:56.709> does<00:06:56.949> actually<00:06:57.429> pick<00:06:57.669> up<00:06:57.819> most<00:06:58.360> of

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:58.629 
this one does actually pick up most of

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.419 
this one does actually pick up most of
the<00:06:58.779> colors<00:06:59.169> and<00:06:59.559> you<00:06:59.739> see<00:06:59.919> a<00:06:59.949> little<00:07:00.129> bit<00:07:00.279> of

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:00.429 
the colors and you see a little bit of

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:02.729 
the colors and you see a little bit of
the<00:07:00.610> orange<00:07:00.789> on<00:07:01.179> the<00:07:01.209> tip<00:07:01.509> in<00:07:02.080> light<00:07:02.439> green

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:02.739 
the orange on the tip in light green

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:06.959 
the orange on the tip in light green
blue<00:07:03.489> purple<00:07:03.969> pink<00:07:04.539> another<00:07:05.469> green<00:07:05.979> yellow

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
blue purple pink another green yellow

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:09.989 
blue purple pink another green yellow
and<00:07:07.539> like<00:07:08.110> a<00:07:08.289> little<00:07:08.529> bit<00:07:08.769> of<00:07:08.979> that<00:07:09.189> orange<00:07:09.699> and

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999
