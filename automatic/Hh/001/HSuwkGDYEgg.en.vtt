fastball but um I don't think that this
is<00:00:29.760> exactly<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.539> same<00:00:30.720> i<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
is exactly the same i think it's a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.200 
is exactly the same i think it's a

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just messing around but um you for your

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
just messing around but um you for your
classes<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.230> fast<00:00:55.649> hand<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
classes you have to have fast hand and I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.200 
classes you have to have fast hand and I
use<00:00:57.469> fast<00:00:58.469> hands<00:00:58.710> yet<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> ballistic

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
use fast hands yet and I use a ballistic

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
use fast hands yet and I use a ballistic
knife<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.320> quick<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
knife because it's like really quick to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.179 
knife because it's like really quick to
pull<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:07.159> but<00:01:08.159> um<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.500> loads<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> out

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pull out but um it like loads it out

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.300 
pull out but um it like loads it out
quicker<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:12.119> way<00:01:12.180> um<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.799> quicker<00:01:14.130> than

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
quicker that way um it's quicker than

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340 
quicker that way um it's quicker than
knife<00:01:14.520> after<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.299> pull<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
knife after you pull it out and that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
knife after you pull it out and that
makes<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> easier<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> shot<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.580> guess<00:01:17.759> i

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
makes it easier for a shot and i guess i

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
makes it easier for a shot and i guess i
can<00:01:18.060> show<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.140> shot<00:01:19.409> i<00:01:19.439> came<00:01:19.740> up

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can show you the other shot i came up

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
can show you the other shot i came up
with<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> few<00:01:20.430> minutes<00:01:20.729> ago<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> assault

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.380 
with a few minutes ago with the assault
shield<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.560> cool<00:01:22.770> looking<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
shield that's really cool looking and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.850 
shield that's really cool looking and
maybe<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> will<00:01:24.689> give<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> guys<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.229> ideas

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
maybe that will give you guys some ideas

use sharp charges because i like the
shock<00:01:34.140> charge<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.159> um<00:01:35.310> i'll<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.390> into

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
shock charge but um i'll get into

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.950 
shock charge but um i'll get into
showing<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:38.040> you're<00:01:38.189> supposed<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> do

alright so i guess the first thing that
you<00:01:41.310> need<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> learn<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> actually

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you need to learn is on how to actually

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.490 
you need to learn is on how to actually
do<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> knife<00:01:44.640> swap<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
do the knife swap in so what you do is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
do the knife swap in so what you do is
of<00:01:46.920> course<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.939> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of course the first thing you do is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.950 
of course the first thing you do is
knife<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.950> that's<00:01:49.950> pretty<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.780> not

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
knife and that's pretty much that's not

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
knife and that's pretty much that's not
all<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.310> definitely<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> most

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
all but that's it's definitely the most

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.280 
all but that's it's definitely the most
important<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> press<00:01:55.829> y<00:01:57.290> right

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
important and then you press y right

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.539 
important and then you press y right
after<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> knife<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> pull<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
after you knife and then you pull out

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
after you knife and then you pull out
your<00:01:59.729> shock<00:01:59.969> charge<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> cancel<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
your shock charge and cancel it and you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
your shock charge and cancel it and you
can<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.640> any<00:02:02.670> gun<00:02:03.329> I've<00:02:03.630> even<00:02:03.930> done

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
can do this with any gun I've even done

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
can do this with any gun I've even done
it<00:02:04.649> while<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it while I was I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.240 
it while I was I
and<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.870> apply<00:02:07.990> myself<00:02:08.290> trying<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.070> this

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and just apply myself trying to do this

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.470 
and just apply myself trying to do this
and<00:02:09.490> um<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.869> what<00:02:11.110> makes<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.890> mean<00:02:12.480> that's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and um that's what makes I I mean that's

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.780 
and um that's what makes I I mean that's
what<00:02:13.600> makes<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> shot<00:02:14.080> kind<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.320> hard<00:02:14.500> is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
what makes the shot kind of hard is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.520 
what makes the shot kind of hard is
doing<00:02:15.790> being<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.270> fast<00:02:16.480> today<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.790> um<00:02:18.940> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
doing being really fast today but um I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.000 
doing being really fast today but um I
guess<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.920> show<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:26.770> some

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
guess I can show you like some

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.160 
guess I can show you like some
variations<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.760> very<00:02:28.210> simple<00:02:28.630> variations

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
variations like very simple variations

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.880 
variations like very simple variations
and<00:02:30.960> then<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.080> can<00:02:32.260> show<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.500> some<00:02:32.740> more

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and then I can show you some more

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.870 
and then I can show you some more
difficult<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.990> cool<00:02:35.170> looking<00:02:35.500> ones

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
difficult and kind of cool looking ones

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.060 
difficult and kind of cool looking ones
boom<00:02:36.880> first<00:02:37.420> off<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:37.990> just<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.650> a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
boom first off I'm just going to do a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.150 
boom first off I'm just going to do a
regular<00:02:40.020> knife<00:02:41.020> stop<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.000> that's<00:02:43.800> that's<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
regular knife stop and that's that's the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
regular knife stop and that's that's the
easiest<00:02:46.150> one<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:48.300> mean<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.480> make<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.660> a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
easiest one and then I mean to make it a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.020 
easiest one and then I mean to make it a
little<00:02:50.050> bit<00:02:50.230> more<00:02:51.510> complex<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.130> can<00:02:54.430> like<00:02:54.820> add

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
little bit more complex you can like add

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.410 
little bit more complex you can like add
more<00:02:55.300> shock<00:02:55.570> charge<00:02:55.840> flips<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.320> bring<00:02:56.500> out

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
more shock charge flips or bring out

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.840 
more shock charge flips or bring out
this<00:02:58.420> thing<00:02:59.080> right<00:02:59.350> here<00:02:59.380> and<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.580> threw

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
this thing right here and I just threw

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.580 
this thing right here and I just threw
it<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.240> guess<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.660> won't<00:03:01.810> see<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> shot<00:03:02.410> with

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
it so I guess you won't see a shot with

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.210 
it so I guess you won't see a shot with
that<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:03.550> um<00:03:04.290> yeah<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.590> like<00:03:05.709> plot<00:03:06.010> your

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
that but um yeah just like plot your

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.890 
that but um yeah just like plot your
shop<00:03:06.430> charges<00:03:06.820> or<00:03:06.940> something<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.600> expert

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
shop charges or something for expert

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.729 
shop charges or something for expert
slip<00:03:08.550> or<00:03:09.550> extra<00:03:10.150> complexity<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.260> don't<00:03:11.440> know<00:03:11.530> I

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
slip or extra complexity I don't know I

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.120 
slip or extra complexity I don't know I
don't<00:03:11.860> know<00:03:11.950> what<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.190> want<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.370> call<00:03:12.519> it

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
don't know what you want to call it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
guess i can show you what the ballistic

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.990 
guess i can show you what the ballistic
knife<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:25.239> shoot<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:26.680> like<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:27.459> press<00:03:27.730> y

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
knife you shoot it like you press y

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.520 
knife you shoot it like you press y
right<00:03:28.330> after<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.660> shoot<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.140> pull<00:03:29.290> out<00:03:29.410> your

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
right after you shoot and pull out your

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.140 
right after you shoot and pull out your
chalk<00:03:29.739> chalk<00:03:30.190> charge<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:30.700> it's<00:03:30.850> kind<00:03:31.090> of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
chalk chalk charge so it's kind of

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.979 
chalk chalk charge so it's kind of
similar<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.800> knife<00:03:32.980> swamp<00:03:33.310> but<00:03:34.180> um<00:03:34.360> shoot

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
similar to the knife swamp but um shoot

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.930 
similar to the knife swamp but um shoot
press<00:03:35.260> Y<00:03:35.470> for<00:03:35.680> some<00:03:35.980> charge<00:03:36.250> don't<00:03:36.459> shoot<00:03:36.760> I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
press Y for some charge don't shoot I

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.699 
press Y for some charge don't shoot I
think<00:03:37.239> that's<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:37.900> cool<00:03:38.110> looking<00:03:38.410> shot

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
think that's a really cool looking shot

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.150 
think that's a really cool looking shot
looks<00:03:39.010> very<00:03:39.280> nice<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:41.440> i<00:03:41.470> can<00:03:41.950> show<00:03:42.130> you

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
looks very nice but now i can show you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.250 
looks very nice but now i can show you
some<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.610> more<00:03:42.760> complex<00:03:43.150> ones<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.720> i<00:03:43.959> know

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
some of the more complex ones and i know

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.350 
some of the more complex ones and i know
the<00:03:44.470> first<00:03:44.739> one<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:44.980> going<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.340> this<00:03:45.550> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
the first one is going to be this the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
a nice swap into a fade with a ballista

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.159 
a nice swap into a fade with a ballista
and<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:07.849> just<00:05:08.060> noticed<00:05:08.479> that<00:05:08.599> little<00:05:08.780> green

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
thing on the side of the ballista I

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.650 
thing on the side of the ballista I
