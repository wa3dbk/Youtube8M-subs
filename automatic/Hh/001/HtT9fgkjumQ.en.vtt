00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.050
 hello and sanya again with you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:14.460
 Today I will show you a review of the program 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.650
 Virtual DJ in general programs for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.369
 making music redoing 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:29.599
 also on making mixes and so on in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.599
 Generally we continue I turned on the music 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.210
 music is needed but you can take any 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 so what else do we have functions in many ways 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:53.899
 so right now wait also volume 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.899
 added to change speed 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.989
 we have here in my save here 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 excerpts some so here that here 5 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.490
 I don’t remember that she’s already in the plan 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 him but this here 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.430
 the tracks themselves are these here 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:22.350
 make a line pylon music switch 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.090
 Here I have here to choose which 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 mode you want degrees music 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:35.450
 worked something here on a similar thing too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:47.090
 choose choose mix style 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:49.399
 and how would you work well this 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 the second we have that is how would they 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.159
 repeat the first time that works 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 this is the second who is there just the same 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.079
 same so this plus is added 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:12.560
 some tracks are quite small in my opinion 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:20.420
 the sound is almost all included here 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:22.760
 different choose hi world for something 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:43.519
 buy music does not want to turn on schA 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:46.989
 try not want to work well here 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:51.380
 You can record something their tracks 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.190
 settings we enter will not even enter 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.269
 settings 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.120
 there he records broadcast change 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.239
 anything well whatever 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.200
 Now I will turn it on and show it here 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.480
 Turned on also select the aroma file 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.239
 which you want can also just 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.540
 change something to write click 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:19.760
 all work well I really do not work for 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.549
 I removed the tick to record made 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.200
 also full screen 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:29.030
 In general, you can still want the program 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.230
 cool i also have others 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.459
