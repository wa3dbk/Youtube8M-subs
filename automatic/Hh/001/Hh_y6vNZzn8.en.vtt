00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
science I once heard of researchers say

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.739 
science I once heard of researchers say
that<00:00:40.949> us<00:00:41.249> gamers<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.789> resilient<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.390> failure

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
that us gamers are resilient and failure

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.829 
that us gamers are resilient and failure
because<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> always<00:00:43.440> find<00:00:43.679> ways<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.070> succeed<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
because we always find ways to succeed I

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.090 
because we always find ways to succeed I
wouldn't<00:00:45.839> say<00:00:45.989> I'm<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.409> resilient<00:00:46.980> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
wouldn't say I'm as much resilient to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.919 
wouldn't say I'm as much resilient to
failure<00:00:47.429> because<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.850> definitely<00:00:48.089> scream<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
failure because I definitely scream and

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.389 
failure because I definitely scream and
curse<00:00:49.109> and<00:00:49.350> freak<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.339> I

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
curse and freak out a lot but I

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.649 
curse and freak out a lot but I
definitely<00:00:50.579> keep<00:00:50.940> trying<00:00:51.210> until<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.510> succeed

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
definitely keep trying until I succeed

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.590 
definitely keep trying until I succeed
so<00:00:52.170> there's<00:00:52.589> that<00:00:52.769> of<00:00:52.920> course<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:54.089> thankfully

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
so there's that of course but thankfully

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
so there's that of course but thankfully
I<00:00:54.659> don't<00:00:54.749> rage<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.530> commander
