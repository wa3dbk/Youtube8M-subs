and hummus the rushing around isn't
going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> solid<00:00:25.769> kill<00:00:26.130> death

going to get you a solid kill death
ratio<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:27.060> solid<00:00:27.420> win-loss<00:00:27.779> ratio<00:00:27.990> just

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
ratio or solid win-loss ratio just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.310 
ratio or solid win-loss ratio just
because<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.429> die<00:00:29.670> incredibly<00:00:30.330> quickly<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
practice makes perfect so it's going to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
practice makes perfect so it's going to
take<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.870> while<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.280> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
take a little while but if you do this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.920 
take a little while but if you do this
properly<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:57.180> you're<00:00:57.300> definitely<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.899> to

definitely going to be improving quite a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
definitely going to be improving quite a
lot<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.469> well<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:02.879> talking

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
lot as well so the things I'm talking

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.990 
lot as well so the things I'm talking
about<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:04.080> map<00:01:04.379> knowledge

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
about are first off map knowledge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
about are first off map knowledge
positioning<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> key<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.750> encoder<00:01:07.290> ghost

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
positioning is key with encoder ghost

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
positioning is key with encoder ghost
after<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> fact<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
after that we have the fact that you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.170 
after that we have the fact that you
need<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.930> utilize<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.590> radar<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.640> its<00:01:11.850> maximum

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
need to utilize the radar to its maximum

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.539 
need to utilize the radar to its maximum
potential<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.680> exactly<00:01:13.860> where<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
potential if you know exactly where the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
potential if you know exactly where the
enemy<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.210> spawn<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:15.840> looking

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
enemy is going to spawn just by looking

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
enemy is going to spawn just by looking
at<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> radar<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.979> seeing<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:17.759> your

teammates<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.450> rats<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.350> going

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
teammates are rats and then it's going

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
teammates are rats and then it's going

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
the things that the AI say within code
videos<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> people<00:01:40.890> simply<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.460> do

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
videos a lot of people simply don't do

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.179 
videos a lot of people simply don't do
it<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> AI<00:01:43.740> within

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it because they think that the AI within

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
it because they think that the AI within
this<00:01:44.310> game<00:01:44.579> does<00:01:44.790> yell<00:01:45.090> random<00:01:45.600> stuff<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
this game does yell random stuff and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
this game does yell random stuff and
that's<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.890> how<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.250> just

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that's not really how it is just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
that's not really how it is just
focusing<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.600> those<00:01:48.780> things<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.439> help<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
focusing on those things can help you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
focusing on those things can help you
out<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> ton<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.060> finally<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.720> also

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
out a ton and then finally there's also

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
out a ton and then finally there's also
having<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.380> proper<00:01:52.680> class<00:01:52.860> setup<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
having a proper class setup and then you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
having a proper class setup and then you
have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.600> things<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.350> gun

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
have the little things like your gun

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
have the little things like your gun
skill<00:01:55.920> you'll<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.759> better<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> certain

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
skill you'll get better with a certain

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.359 
skill you'll get better with a certain
weapon<00:01:58.049> over<00:01:58.140> time<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.619> by<00:01:58.740> using<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.219> over

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
weapon over time just by using it over

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730 
weapon over time just by using it over
and<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.850> again<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.469> things

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and over again then you also have things

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950 
and over again then you also have things
like<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.189> reaction<00:02:02.670> time<00:02:02.880> reaction<00:02:03.509> time

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
like your reaction time reaction time

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.709 
like your reaction time reaction time
really<00:02:04.350> does<00:02:04.619> play<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.189> huge<00:02:05.579> part<00:02:05.719> within

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
really does play a huge part within

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
really does play a huge part within
coded<00:02:07.140> egos<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.099> die<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.399> about

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
coded egos just because you die in about

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.390 
coded egos just because you die in about
like<00:02:08.940> 3/10<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.780> seconds<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.280> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
like 3/10 of seconds that's just how it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.330 
like 3/10 of seconds that's just how it
is<00:02:11.489> your<00:02:11.700> average<00:02:11.819> kill<00:02:12.150> time<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> about<00:02:12.660> 300

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
is your average kill time is about 300

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.369 
is your average kill time is about 300
milliseconds<00:02:14.090> that's<00:02:14.629> how<00:02:14.750> fast<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.200> die

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
milliseconds that's how fast you die

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.080 
milliseconds that's how fast you die
within<00:02:15.620> cold<00:02:15.980> ago<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.400> those<00:02:16.550> things<00:02:16.760> matter

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
within cold ago so those things matter

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.420 
within cold ago so those things matter
as<00:02:17.239> well<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.140> those<00:02:18.410> things<00:02:18.739> will<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.099> taught

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
as well but those things will be taught

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.220 
as well but those things will be taught
over<00:02:19.730> time<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.300> can't<00:02:20.569> really<00:02:20.750> help<00:02:21.019> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
over time and I can't really help you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.259 
over time and I can't really help you
out<00:02:21.290> when<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.340> comes<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.879> learning<00:02:23.030> those

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
out when it comes to learning those

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.930 
out when it comes to learning those
things<00:02:23.440> anyway<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.500> first<00:02:24.830> off<00:02:25.040> map<00:02:25.400> knowledge

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
things anyway so first off map knowledge

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.540 
things anyway so first off map knowledge
this<00:02:26.629> is<00:02:26.959> something<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:28.129> very<00:02:28.370> very

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
this is something that it's very very

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.089 
this is something that it's very very
important<00:02:29.150> think<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.750> girls<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.799> said

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
important think of the girls like I said

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.740 
important think of the girls like I said
at<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> start<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.700> video<00:02:31.849> positioning

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
at the start of this video positioning

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.199 
at the start of this video positioning
is<00:02:32.989> key<00:02:33.349> now<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.190> thing<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.640> thing

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
is key now the thing is that thing

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.920 
is key now the thing is that thing
called<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.569> ghost

most<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> multiplayer<00:02:37.190> maps<00:02:37.430> are<00:02:37.670> pretty

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
most of the multiplayer maps are pretty

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.089 
most of the multiplayer maps are pretty
big<00:02:38.090> compared<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.720> previous<00:02:39.049> title<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.890> course

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
big compared to previous title of course

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.220 
big compared to previous title of course
you<00:02:40.250> also<00:02:40.400> have<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.090> medium<00:02:41.450> sized<00:02:41.660> maps<00:02:41.989> like

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
you also have the medium sized maps like

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.039 
you also have the medium sized maps like
a<00:02:42.260> tank<00:02:42.680> or<00:02:42.980> pretty<00:02:43.610> small<00:02:43.849> size<00:02:44.120> map<00:02:44.450> like

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
a tank or pretty small size map like

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.960 
a tank or pretty small size map like
strike<00:02:45.410> zone<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:46.280> they're<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.549> on<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.790> scene

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
strike zone but they're not on the scene

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.759 
strike zone but they're not on the scene
most<00:02:47.269> of<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.480> maps<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.870> pretty<00:02:48.079> big<00:02:48.290> compared

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
most of the maps are pretty big compared

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.830 
most of the maps are pretty big compared
to<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> previous<00:02:49.489> titles<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.150> because<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
to the previous titles and because of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.600 
to the previous titles and because of
this<00:02:51.019> there<00:02:51.380> are<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> lot<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:52.099> long<00:02:52.340> launch

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
this there are a lot of long launch

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.789 
this there are a lot of long launch
sites<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.660> there<00:02:53.840> are<00:02:53.930> also<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.260> lot<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.500> choke

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
sites but there are also a lot of choke

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.009 
sites but there are also a lot of choke
points<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.849> main<00:02:56.000> problem<00:02:56.450> with<00:02:56.599> this<00:02:56.750> is

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
points and the main problem with this is

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.750 
points and the main problem with this is
that<00:02:57.049> there<00:02:57.380> aren't<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.769> any<00:02:58.010> main<00:02:58.400> choke

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that there aren't like any main choke

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.000 
that there aren't like any main choke
points<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.329> basically<00:03:00.230> every<00:03:00.500> single<00:03:00.530> one<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
points on basically every single one of

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.250 
points on basically every single one of
the<00:03:01.340> multiplayer<00:03:01.790> maps<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:02.989> want<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the multiplayer maps so if you want to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
the multiplayer maps so if you want to
play<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.500> smart<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.489> doesn't<00:03:04.910> mean<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
play it smart and that doesn't mean that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.240 
play it smart and that doesn't mean that
you<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.420> specifically<00:03:06.079> focus<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:07.040> area

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
you can specifically focus on one area

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.069 
you can specifically focus on one area
because<00:03:08.090> if<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.209> do<00:03:08.329> that<00:03:08.510> you're<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.019> going

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
because if you do that you're not going

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.350 
because if you do that you're not going
to<00:03:09.319> be<00:03:09.410> getting<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.799> lot<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.010> kills<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
to be getting a lot of kills and in the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.809 
to be getting a lot of kills and in the
end<00:03:11.540> most<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.200> us<00:03:12.319> want<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.680> get<00:03:13.069> as<00:03:13.250> many<00:03:13.400> kills

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819

single map now how you do this the
bachelors<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.180> play<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.630> game<00:03:26.660> quite<00:03:27.560> a

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
bachelors have to play the game quite a

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.589 
bachelors have to play the game quite a
lot<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:28.340> want<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.549> get<00:03:28.700> good<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.209> certain

lot if you want to get good on a certain

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.780 
lot if you want to get good on a certain
map<00:03:29.780> then<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.500> could<00:03:30.680> recommend<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.519> try

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
map then I could recommend you to try

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.729 
map then I could recommend you to try
out<00:03:31.940> these<00:03:32.150> squads<00:03:32.599> game<00:03:32.870> type<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> little

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
out these squads game type for a little

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.289 
out these squads game type for a little
bit<00:03:33.859> then<00:03:34.459> again<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:34.940> going<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.150> get

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
bit then again that's going to get

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.629 
bit then again that's going to get
boring<00:03:35.750> very<00:03:35.930> very<00:03:36.170> quickly<00:03:36.470> but<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.370> need<00:03:37.519> to

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
boring very very quickly but you need to

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.280 
boring very very quickly but you need to
basically<00:03:37.970> figure<00:03:38.359> out<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:38.810> best<00:03:38.930> spot

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
basically figure out the best spot

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.110 
basically figure out the best spot
serviceable<00:03:39.769> map<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.549> best<00:03:40.730> head<00:03:40.910> great

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
serviceable map the best head great

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.059 
serviceable map the best head great
response<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.720> then<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.139> on<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.470> forth

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
response and then so on so forth

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.920 
response and then so on so forth
now<00:03:43.549> another<00:03:43.760> thing<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.239> keep<00:03:44.389> in<00:03:44.510> mind<00:03:44.569> is

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
now another thing to keep in mind is

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.089 
now another thing to keep in mind is
that<00:03:45.109> within<00:03:45.260> quality<00:03:45.680> goes

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
that within quality goes

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.240 
that within quality goes
hearing<00:03:46.609> footsteps<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.450> pretty<00:03:47.840> easy<00:03:48.079> but<00:03:48.889> if

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
hearing footsteps is pretty easy but if

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.400 
hearing footsteps is pretty easy but if
you're<00:03:49.340> using<00:03:49.489> amplified<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.419> recommend<00:03:51.290> you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
you're using amplified I recommend you

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.370 
you're using amplified I recommend you
to<00:03:51.680> never<00:03:52.040> chase<00:03:52.579> an<00:03:52.849> opponent<00:03:53.450> if<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.169> can

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
to never chase an opponent if you can

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.069 
to never chase an opponent if you can
hear<00:03:54.709> him<00:03:54.919> running<00:03:55.400> toward<00:03:55.910> you<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.720> might

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
hear him running toward you this might

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.990 
hear him running toward you this might
sound<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.680> little<00:03:57.709> bit<00:03:57.919> cheap<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.910> is

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
sound a little bit cheap but this is

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.490 
sound a little bit cheap but this is
also<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.389> savers<00:03:59.690> way<00:03:59.810> if<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.049> can<00:04:00.200> hear<00:04:00.410> an

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
also the savers way if you can hear an

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.559 
also the savers way if you can hear an
opponent's<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.549> can<00:04:01.760> hear<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.150> he<00:04:02.359> or<00:04:02.540> she

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
opponent's you can hear that he or she

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.720 
opponent's you can hear that he or she
was<00:04:02.989> walking<00:04:03.349> towards<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.829> these<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.549> just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
was walking towards you these you just

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.670 
was walking towards you these you just
find<00:04:05.000> yourself<00:04:05.120> position<00:04:05.840> they<00:04:06.290> should<00:04:06.530> just

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
find yourself position they should just

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.470 
find yourself position they should just
wait<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.099> out<00:04:07.220> now<00:04:07.880> these<00:04:08.000> are<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.329> get

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
wait it out now these are going to get

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.120 
wait it out now these are going to get
through<00:04:08.630> quite<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> lot<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.380> easy<00:04:09.590> kills<00:04:09.919> and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
through quite a lot of easy kills and

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.250 
through quite a lot of easy kills and
pretty<00:04:10.340> often<00:04:10.579> as<00:04:10.819> well<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.660> definitely<00:04:11.780> do

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
pretty often as well so definitely do

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.009 
pretty often as well so definitely do
that<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.799> you<00:04:12.950> do<00:04:13.160> get<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.459> chance<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.780> fact

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
that if you do get the chance to in fact

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.589 
that if you do get the chance to in fact
to<00:04:15.290> do<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.579> terms<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:16.880> map<00:04:17.120> knowledge

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
to do that but in terms of map knowledge

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.479 
to do that but in terms of map knowledge
you<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.900> got<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.139> figure<00:04:18.320> out<00:04:18.530> what<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.340> best

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
you just got to figure out what the best

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.610 
you just got to figure out what the best
flanking<00:04:19.970> routes<00:04:20.150> are<00:04:20.419> but<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.109> best<00:04:21.289> spots

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
flanking routes are but the best spots

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.920 
flanking routes are but the best spots
the<00:04:21.859> PNR<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:23.000> from<00:04:23.210> there<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:23.570> want<00:04:23.719> to

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
the PNR and then from there you want to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.440 
the PNR and then from there you want to
know<00:04:24.110> which<00:04:24.380> spot<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.770> use<00:04:25.010> when<00:04:25.669> an<00:04:25.849> enemy<00:04:26.030> is

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
know which spot to use when an enemy is

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.490 
know which spot to use when an enemy is
in<00:04:26.599> a<00:04:26.690> certain<00:04:26.870> spot<00:04:27.200> as

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
in a certain spot as

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.770 
in a certain spot as
and<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:28.040> everything<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.520> do<00:04:28.850> with<00:04:29.090> using

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
and this is everything to do with using

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.230 
and this is everything to do with using
the<00:04:29.990> radar<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.650> maximum<00:04:31.130> potential<00:04:31.460> now<00:04:32.210> I

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the radar to the maximum potential now I

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.880 
the radar to the maximum potential now I
can't<00:04:32.630> really<00:04:32.750> help<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.260> out<00:04:33.290> with<00:04:33.500> learning

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
can't really help you out with learning

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.280 
can't really help you out with learning
the<00:04:34.010> spawns<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.640> using<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.540> radar<00:04:35.960> with<00:04:36.170> in

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
the spawns and using the radar with in

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.200 
the spawns and using the radar with in
something<00:04:36.650> like<00:04:36.770> domination<00:04:37.610> or

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
something like domination or

mainly because I do not play those game

types I really only played to the em I
play<00:04:46.100> crank<00:04:46.430> 3<00:04:46.580> now<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:46.880> then<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.270> play<00:04:47.630> 3<00:04:47.930> Pro

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
play crank 3 now and then I play 3 Pro

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.390 
play crank 3 now and then I play 3 Pro
every<00:04:48.290> now<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.500> then<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:48.860> play<00:04:49.130> Kill

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
every now and then and I play Kill

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.070 
every now and then and I play Kill
Confirmed<00:04:49.430> every<00:04:50.030> now<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.270> then<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.600> the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
Confirmed every now and then and the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.990 
Confirmed every now and then and the
spawns<00:04:51.380> within<00:04:51.740> those<00:04:51.920> game<00:04:52.190> types<00:04:52.490> are<00:04:52.700> very

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
spawns within those game types are very

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.910 
spawns within those game types are very
very<00:04:53.240> predictable<00:04:53.840> now<00:04:54.440> terms<00:04:54.740> like

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
very predictable now terms like

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.380 
very predictable now terms like
domination<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.760> spawns<00:04:56.030> are<00:04:56.210> very

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
domination the spawns are very

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.390 
domination the spawns are very
predictable<00:04:56.930> as<00:04:57.050> well<00:04:57.230> so<00:04:57.830> using<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.160> radar

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
predictable as well so using the radar

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.730 
predictable as well so using the radar
becomes<00:04:58.880> pretty<00:04:59.180> easy<00:04:59.360> as<00:04:59.570> well<00:04:59.600> because<00:05:00.560> if

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
becomes pretty easy as well because if

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.040 
becomes pretty easy as well because if
you<00:05:00.830> let's<00:05:01.070> say<00:05:01.250> have<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.700> a<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.000> B<00:05:02.120> flag<00:05:02.420> then

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
you let's say have the a and B flag then

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.210 
you let's say have the a and B flag then
your<00:05:03.170> enemies<00:05:03.470> are<00:05:03.620> going<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.830> be<00:05:03.920> spawning

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
your enemies are going to be spawning

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.370 
your enemies are going to be spawning
within<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.550> certain<00:05:04.760> radius<00:05:05.090> around<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.170> C

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
within a certain radius around the C

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.650 
within a certain radius around the C
flag<00:05:06.680> but<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:06.950> don't<00:05:07.370> know<00:05:07.580> exactly<00:05:07.760> how<00:05:08.210> big

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
flag but I don't know exactly how big

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.810 
flag but I don't know exactly how big
that<00:05:08.840> radius<00:05:09.320> is<00:05:09.500> then<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.340> course<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.670> also

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
that radius is then of course you also

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.640 
that radius is then of course you also
have<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.240> problem<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.930> when<00:05:12.500> your

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
have the problem that when your

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.560 
have the problem that when your
teammates<00:05:13.130> run<00:05:13.430> into<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.150> enemies<00:05:14.420> their

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
teammates run into the enemies their

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.420 
teammates run into the enemies their
spawn<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.680> spawn<00:05:15.920> are<00:05:16.130> going<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.370> be

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
spawn that the spawn are going to be

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.130 
spawn that the spawn are going to be
flipping<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:17.210> all<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.600> way<00:05:17.690> over<00:05:17.990> on<00:05:18.020> the

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
flipping to all the way over on the

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.320 
flipping to all the way over on the
other<00:05:18.200> side<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.520> map<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:19.850> that<00:05:20.240> is

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
other side of the map so that is

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.270 
other side of the map so that is
something<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.780> keep<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.020> mind<00:05:21.080> but<00:05:21.919> in<00:05:22.070> terms

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
something to keep in mind but in terms

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.490 
something to keep in mind but in terms
of<00:05:22.460> TDM<00:05:22.940> figuring<00:05:23.660> out<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.900> spawns<00:05:24.200> and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
of TDM figuring out the spawns and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.720 
of TDM figuring out the spawns and
figuring<00:05:24.860> out<00:05:24.950> where<00:05:25.160> your<00:05:25.250> opponents<00:05:25.700> are

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
figuring out where your opponents are

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.030 
figuring out where your opponents are
rats<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.510> a<00:05:26.570> lot<00:05:26.960> easier<00:05:27.350> just<00:05:27.380> because<00:05:27.590> within

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
rats is a lot easier just because within

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.220 
rats is a lot easier just because within
TDM<00:05:28.550> if<00:05:29.000> you<00:05:29.240> know<00:05:29.419> where<00:05:29.540> your<00:05:29.630> teammates<00:05:29.990> are

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
TDM if you know where your teammates are

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.260 
TDM if you know where your teammates are
at<00:05:30.350> now<00:05:30.919> you<00:05:30.950> can<00:05:31.220> kind<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.520> like<00:05:31.669> mirror<00:05:32.150> in

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
at now you can kind of like mirror in

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.240 
at now you can kind of like mirror in
the<00:05:32.360> mini-map<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:33.050> certain<00:05:33.350> way<00:05:33.500> and<00:05:33.770> that

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
the mini-map in a certain way and that

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.920 
the mini-map in a certain way and that
way<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.490> can<00:05:34.700> figure<00:05:34.910> out<00:05:35.030> we<00:05:35.419> are<00:05:35.510> enemies<00:05:35.660> of

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
way you can figure out we are enemies of

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.750 
way you can figure out we are enemies of
rats<00:05:36.110> because<00:05:36.710> your<00:05:37.010> enemies<00:05:37.400> are<00:05:37.550> going<00:05:37.700> to

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
rats because your enemies are going to

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.970 
rats because your enemies are going to
be<00:05:37.850> spawning<00:05:38.180> over<00:05:38.600> on<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.780> other<00:05:38.960> sides<00:05:39.320> for

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
be spawning over on the other sides for

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.800 
be spawning over on the other sides for
my<00:05:40.100> view<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.640> your<00:05:40.850> teammates<00:05:41.240> are<00:05:41.360> spoiling

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
my view and your teammates are spoiling

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.480 
my view and your teammates are spoiling
and<00:05:41.990> that<00:05:42.440> is<00:05:42.560> really<00:05:42.710> all<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.190> there<00:05:43.340> is<00:05:43.370> to

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
and that is really all that there is to

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.080 
and that is really all that there is to
it

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
it

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.790 
it
anyway<00:05:44.630> so<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.840> just<00:05:45.050> noticed<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.530> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
anyway so I just noticed that the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.620 
anyway so I just noticed that the
gameplay<00:05:46.250> is<00:05:46.370> basically<00:05:46.729> this<00:05:46.850> ramping<00:05:47.330> up<00:05:47.419> at

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
gameplay is basically this ramping up at

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.540 
gameplay is basically this ramping up at
the<00:05:47.720> moment<00:05:48.080> now<00:05:48.650> I'll<00:05:48.830> continue<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.370> talk

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
the moment now I'll continue to talk

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.610 
the moment now I'll continue to talk
about<00:05:49.760> this<00:05:50.150> topic<00:05:50.390> in<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:51.080> later<00:05:51.290> video<00:05:51.440> I

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
about this topic in a later video I

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.040 
about this topic in a later video I
simply<00:05:52.070> can't<00:05:52.370> put<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.090> all<00:05:53.240> in<00:05:53.419> one<00:05:53.660> that's

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
simply can't put it all in one that's

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.980 
simply can't put it all in one that's
pretty<00:05:54.320> safe<00:05:55.010> to<00:05:55.040> say<00:05:55.400> I<00:05:55.430> guess<00:05:55.910> anyway<00:05:56.750> if<00:05:56.870> you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
pretty safe to say I guess anyway if you

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.510 
pretty safe to say I guess anyway if you
enjoyed<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.320> video<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.620> likely<00:05:58.010> beat<00:05:58.190> greats

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
enjoyed the video and likely beat greats

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.120 
enjoyed the video and likely beat greats
we<00:05:59.120> could<00:05:59.300> get<00:05:59.479> this<00:05:59.660> video<00:05:59.930> up<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.350> 400<00:06:00.979> like

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
we could get this video up to 400 like

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.380 
we could get this video up to 400 like
that'd<00:06:01.340> be<00:06:01.490> fantastic

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
that'd be fantastic

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.900 
that'd be fantastic
if<00:06:02.780> not<00:06:03.110> that's<00:06:03.350> fine<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.950> with<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:04.610> said<00:06:04.850> I

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
if not that's fine and with that said I

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.540 
if not that's fine and with that said I
