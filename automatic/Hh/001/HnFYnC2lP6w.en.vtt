00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
is really lightweight i won't give it

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.140 
is really lightweight i won't give it
that<00:05:51.419> like<00:05:51.870> i<00:05:52.229> like<00:05:53.039> that<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.370> is<00:05:53.520> lightweight

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
that like i like that it is lightweight

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.629 
that like i like that it is lightweight
but<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.900> be<00:05:55.020> honest<00:05:55.530> it's<00:05:56.160> actually<00:05:56.490> a<00:05:56.520> little

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
but to be honest it's actually a little

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.930 
but to be honest it's actually a little
too<00:05:57.000> lightweight<00:05:57.660> for<00:05:58.169> me<00:05:58.320> it's<00:05:59.250> just<00:05:59.490> like<00:05:59.699> if

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
too lightweight for me it's just like if

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.260 
too lightweight for me it's just like if
you<00:05:59.970> put<00:06:00.270> on<00:06:00.389> too<00:06:00.660> much<00:06:00.690> it<00:06:01.229> becomes<00:06:01.650> gummy<00:06:02.270> it

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
you put on too much it becomes gummy it

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.650 
you put on too much it becomes gummy it
feels<00:06:03.479> kind<00:06:03.690> of<00:06:03.750> gummy<00:06:03.990> kind<00:06:04.380> of<00:06:04.470> sticky<00:06:05.660> but

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
feels kind of gummy kind of sticky but

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.600 
feels kind of gummy kind of sticky but
then<00:06:06.840> when<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.169> your<00:06:07.470> skin<00:06:07.740> absorbs<00:06:08.160> it<00:06:08.280> is

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
then when to your skin absorbs it is

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.719 
then when to your skin absorbs it is
instantly<00:06:09.090> soft<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.199> mean<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:11.280> is<00:06:11.340> nice

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
instantly soft so I mean this is nice

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.029 
instantly soft so I mean this is nice
once<00:06:12.030> your<00:06:12.449> skin<00:06:12.690> absorbs<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.260> does<00:06:13.710> make<00:06:13.919> your

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
once your skin absorbs it does make your

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.110 
once your skin absorbs it does make your
skin<00:06:14.160> feel<00:06:14.340> instantly<00:06:15.000> soft<00:06:16.130> but<00:06:17.130> at<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.880> same

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
skin feel instantly soft but at the same

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.570 
skin feel instantly soft but at the same
time<00:06:18.479> it's<00:06:18.960> actually<00:06:19.620> just<00:06:19.830> too<00:06:20.190> lightweight

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
time it's actually just too lightweight

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.790
