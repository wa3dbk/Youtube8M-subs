is that a difference the bench stories
at<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.230> going

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
at first I think that's why we're going

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
at first I think that's why we're going
to<00:00:40.410> win<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> league<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.829> season<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.879> if

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.520 
isn't feeling it's a team we met last
couple<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> seasons<00:01:18.960> when<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.409> van

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
couple of seasons when we have van

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
couple of seasons when we have van
Persie<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.979> stuff<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> allow<00:01:21.869> them

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
Persie and stuff we have to allow them

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
Persie and stuff we have to allow them
Percy<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> gold<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> look<00:01:23.490> at

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
Percy to get the gold but if you look at

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
Percy to get the gold but if you look at
today<00:01:23.850> we've<00:01:24.240> had<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:25.470> had<00:01:25.560> three<00:01:25.740> different

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
today we've had we had three different

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.580 
today we've had we had three different
goalscorers<00:01:26.189> today<00:01:26.610> mmm<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.479> had<00:01:27.600> Ozel<00:01:27.990> Ramsey

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
goalscorers today mmm we had Ozel Ramsey

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
goalscorers today mmm we had Ozel Ramsey
and<00:01:28.909> scored<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.329> shock

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and scored the other will shock

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.810 
and scored the other will shock
course<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.490> mean<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.759> now

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
course so that's what I mean right now

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
course so that's what I mean right now
we<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.479> rely<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.750> midfielders<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.619> we've

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we can rely on midfielders as well we've

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.120 
we can rely on midfielders as well we've
