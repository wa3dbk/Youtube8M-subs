00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
right now teams that are probably gonna

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.020

Detroit<00:02:57.140> Lions<00:02:57.380> most<00:02:57.680> definitely<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:59.739> just

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
Detroit Lions most definitely I just

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:01.900 
Detroit Lions most definitely I just
don't<00:03:00.890> think<00:03:01.010> they<00:03:01.099> want<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.310> spend<00:03:01.550> any<00:03:01.670> other

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that's elite that's one of the release

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.460 
that's elite that's one of the release
problems<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.550> oh<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.080> big<00:03:09.230> problem

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.260 
problems I have oh it is a big problem
but<00:03:09.890> they've<00:03:10.190> got<00:03:10.220> plenty<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.030> other<00:03:11.209> things

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
but they've got plenty of other things

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.270 
but they've got plenty of other things
they<00:03:11.780> need<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.080> address<00:03:12.290> oh<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.920> Minnesota

Vikings<00:03:16.370> were<00:03:16.760> talks<00:03:17.090> back<00:03:17.300> in<00:03:17.420> February<00:03:18.069> but

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
Vikings were talks back in February but

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.000

they<00:03:19.190> cut<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.580> out<00:03:19.640> um<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:21.830> think

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
they cut that out um but I think

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.850 
they cut that out um but I think
Minnesota<00:03:22.340> has<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.640> most<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.940> gain<00:03:22.970> from

think<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.720> Jay<00:03:53.959> Cutler<00:03:54.320> would<00:03:54.530> also<00:03:54.859> drive

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310

daniels<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.440> would<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.620> a

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
daniels so I I think that would be a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.100 
daniels so I I think that would be a
good<00:04:21.829> idea<00:04:22.010> but<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.669> mean<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.600> can<00:04:23.720> see<00:04:23.870> from

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
good idea but I mean as you can see from

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.740 
good idea but I mean as you can see from
the<00:04:24.500> Houston<00:04:24.800> Texas<00:04:25.160> past<00:04:25.430> they<00:04:26.300> stuck<00:04:26.720> with

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
the Houston Texas past they stuck with

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.540 
the Houston Texas past they stuck with
David<00:04:27.380> Carr<00:04:27.650> for<00:04:28.330> what<00:04:29.380> five<00:04:30.380> years<00:04:30.770> or<00:04:31.280> more

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
David Carr for what five years or more

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.490 
David Carr for what five years or more
and<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.240> finally<00:04:32.450> got<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.810> shop<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.289> it'll
