less broken but you still have that but
this<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.380> my<00:02:56.590> new<00:02:57.010> thought<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.550> new<00:02:57.790> tech<00:02:58.120> as

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
this is my new thought and new tech as

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.130 
this is my new thought and new tech as
to<00:02:58.630> why<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.860> card<00:03:00.390> could<00:03:01.390> see<00:03:01.630> an<00:03:01.750> increase

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
to why this card could see an increase

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.060 
to why this card could see an increase
in<00:03:02.170> play<00:03:03.750> being<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.320> card<00:03:05.890> has<00:03:06.010> a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
in play being that this card has a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.220 
in play being that this card has a
broken<00:03:06.430> aspect<00:03:07.120> other<00:03:07.330> than<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.750> allows<00:03:07.989> your

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
broken aspect other than it allows your

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.810 
broken aspect other than it allows your
