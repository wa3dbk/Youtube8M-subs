Lena<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.850> full<00:01:00.059> drive<00:01:02.239> meeting<00:01:03.239> us

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
Lena this is a full drive meeting us

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.950 
Lena this is a full drive meeting us
really<00:01:06.330> low

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
really low

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.350 
really low
and<00:01:08.470> then<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:09.310> fight<00:01:09.520> feels<00:01:09.850> really<00:01:10.180> between

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
and then the fight feels really between

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.020 
and then the fight feels really between
sitting<00:01:11.010> targets<00:01:12.010> itself<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.400> big<00:01:12.580> reveal<00:01:12.910> in

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
sitting targets itself a big reveal in

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.470 
sitting targets itself a big reveal in
the<00:01:13.060> engine

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.760 

nothing<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.610> touch<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.940> fun

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
nothing is touch a bit of fun

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.920 
nothing is touch a bit of fun
so<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:21.000> pretty<00:01:21.240> safe<00:01:21.570> car<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so it's a really pretty safe car to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.649 
so it's a really pretty safe car to
drive<00:01:22.079> but<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:22.890> sort<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> both<00:01:23.700> sort<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
drive but you get sort of both sort of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
drive but you get sort of both sort of
things

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
things

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
things
let's<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.649> lot<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> understeer<00:01:26.369> like

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
let's can get a lot of understeer like

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.830 
let's can get a lot of understeer like
you<00:01:26.939> do<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> favor<00:01:27.329> go<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.770> Lincoln's
