the<00:02:15.450> sport<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.840> boxing<00:02:16.040> say<00:02:17.040> goodbye<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the sport of boxing say goodbye to the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.830 
the sport of boxing say goodbye to the
boxing<00:02:18.090> fans<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.629> around<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.500> world<00:02:19.709> and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
boxing fans that around the world and

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.970 
boxing fans that around the world and
start<00:02:21.840> focusing<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:23.010> politics<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.969> guess<00:02:24.980> if

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
start focusing on on politics I guess if

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.970 
start focusing on on politics I guess if
he<00:02:26.310> loses<00:02:26.519> fight<00:02:26.939> but<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> said<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.859> don't

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
he loses fight but like I said I don't

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.819 
he loses fight but like I said I don't
think<00:02:29.219> he<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:30.510> without<00:02:31.049> being<00:02:31.319> said<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
think he will but without being said I

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.619 
think he will but without being said I
mean<00:02:32.129> Pacquiao's<00:02:32.549> career<00:02:32.909> is<00:02:33.000> almost<00:02:33.239> over

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
mean Pacquiao's career is almost over

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.089 
mean Pacquiao's career is almost over
anyway<00:02:34.109> I<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:35.189> he<00:02:35.370> will<00:02:35.549> retire<00:02:35.879> next<00:02:36.180> year

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
anyway I think he will retire next year

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.879 
anyway I think he will retire next year
probably<00:02:38.099> by<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.340> end<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.730> 2015<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.629> think<00:02:39.889> late

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
probably by the end of 2015 I think late

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.360 
probably by the end of 2015 I think late
2015<00:02:41.639> will<00:02:42.629> be<00:02:42.780> his<00:02:42.900> last<00:02:42.959> fight<00:02:43.439> even<00:02:44.159> if<00:02:44.250> he

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
2015 will be his last fight even if he

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.679 
2015 will be his last fight even if he
loses<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.819> fight<00:02:44.879> I<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.420> he<00:02:45.540> will

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
loses this fight I think he will

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.869 
loses this fight I think he will
continue<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.200> box<00:02:46.530> no<00:02:46.829> matter<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.220> until<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
continue to box no matter what until the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.899 
continue to box no matter what until the
until<00:02:48.720> next<00:02:48.959> year<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.409> think<00:02:50.310> he<00:02:50.430> will<00:02:50.579> retire

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
until next year I think he will retire

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.119 
until next year I think he will retire
late<00:02:51.629> 2015<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.500> think<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.769> mentioned<00:02:52.889> this

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
late 2015 I think I mentioned this

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.879 
late 2015 I think I mentioned this
before<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.879> because<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.620> 2016<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.769> an

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
before it's because a 2016 it's an

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.369 
before it's because a 2016 it's an
election<00:02:56.159> year<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.939> I<00:02:57.930> think<00:02:58.139> he'll<00:02:58.349> be

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
election year and I think he'll be

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.099 
election year and I think he'll be
you'll<00:02:59.189> possibly<00:02:59.459> be<00:02:59.909> running<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.480> Senator

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
you'll possibly be running for Senator

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.530 
you'll possibly be running for Senator
over<00:03:01.469> there<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.889> Philippines<00:03:02.280> he<00:03:03.030> looks

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
over there in the Philippines he looks

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.479 
over there in the Philippines he looks
like<00:03:03.659> he<00:03:03.840> might<00:03:04.019> run<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.590> higher<00:03:04.799> office<00:03:05.280> or

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
like he might run for a higher office or

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.270 
like he might run for a higher office or
possibly<00:03:06.239> run<00:03:06.629> for<00:03:06.870> vice<00:03:07.169> president<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:08.129> vice
