welcome<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.010> much-delayed<00:00:08.849> unboxing<00:00:09.599> of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
welcome to my much-delayed unboxing of

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.180 
welcome to my much-delayed unboxing of
the<00:00:09.809> Radeon<00:00:10.200> HD<00:00:11.150> 7870<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:13.080> XFX<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.040> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the Radeon HD 7870 from XFX this is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
the Radeon HD 7870 from XFX this is
their<00:00:14.400> core<00:00:14.730> Edition<00:00:15.210> card<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.929> even<00:00:16.289> though

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
their core Edition card but even though

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.920 
their core Edition card but even though
it's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.770> core<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.550> like<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> more<00:00:18.119> basic<00:00:18.330> Edition

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it's a core or like a more basic Edition

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
it's a core or like a more basic Edition
card<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.289> guess<00:00:19.470> compared<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> their<00:00:20.189> double<00:00:20.520> D

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
card I guess compared to their double D

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300 
card I guess compared to their double D
card<00:00:21.090> which<00:00:21.270> has<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:22.020> cooling<00:00:22.439> fans<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
card which has two cooling fans this is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
card which has two cooling fans this is
still<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.060> gigahertz<00:00:24.630> Edition<00:00:25.230> card<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
still a gigahertz Edition card so the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.580 
still a gigahertz Edition card so the
GPU<00:00:26.430> itself<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.300> clocked<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.199> gigahertz

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
GPU itself is clocked at one gigahertz

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
GPU itself is clocked at one gigahertz
so<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.150> based<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> same<00:00:30.960> GPU<00:00:31.470> as

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
so this is not based on the same GPU as

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.350 
so this is not based on the same GPU as
the<00:00:31.800> 7950<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> 7970<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.910> are<00:00:35.910> using<00:00:36.239> a

7870 falls just in the range of a gtx
570<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.809> 580<00:00:55.320> usually<00:00:55.949> falling<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.430> between

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
570 or 580 usually falling in between

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
570 or 580 usually falling in between
those<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.239> parts<00:00:57.570> from<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> competition<00:00:58.379> but

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
those two parts from the competition but

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
those two parts from the competition but
because<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> manufactured<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> more

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
because this is manufactured on a more

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.260 
because this is manufactured on a more
advanced<00:01:01.500> process<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.730> able<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> achieve

that<00:01:03.629> performance<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.500> less<00:01:04.530> power

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that performance with less power

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
that performance with less power

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.969 
of a production shortfall for the most
part<00:02:02.340> since<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.790> were<00:02:02.850> released<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.170> what

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
part since they were released but what

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.740 
part since they were released but what
that<00:02:05.130> should<00:02:05.369> tell<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:05.790> them<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that should tell you about them is that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.559 
that should tell you about them is that
they<00:02:06.930> deliver<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.380> very<00:02:07.950> compelling<00:02:08.640> price<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
they deliver a very compelling price to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.640 
they deliver a very compelling price to
performance<00:02:09.750> ratio<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.830> also

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
performance ratio and also

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.340 
performance ratio and also
and<00:02:13.650> also<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.850> people<00:02:15.600> are<00:02:15.750> demanding<00:02:16.020> these

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
and also that people are demanding these

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.920 
and also that people are demanding these
cards<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.280> let's<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.760> closer<00:02:18.300> look<00:02:18.480> at

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
cards so let's have a closer look at

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.230 
cards so let's have a closer look at
this<00:02:19.380> particular<00:02:19.980> card<00:02:20.190> XFX<00:02:20.700> does<00:02:20.940> such<00:02:21.210> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
this particular card XFX does such a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880 
this particular card XFX does such a
good<00:02:21.570> job<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.170> aesthetics<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
good job of the aesthetics and the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.030 
good job of the aesthetics and the
overall<00:02:23.340> look<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.270> their<00:02:24.420> GPUs<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.080> let's<00:02:25.620> dig

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
overall look of their GPUs but let's dig

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.980 
overall look of their GPUs but let's dig
a<00:02:26.070> little<00:02:26.160> bit<00:02:26.430> deeper<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.940> find<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.390> how

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
a little bit deeper and find out how

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.870 
a little bit deeper and find out how
well<00:02:28.350> design<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.130> check<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.490> out<00:02:29.730> so

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
well design this is check this out so

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.940 
well design this is check this out so
this<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> very<00:02:30.600> beefy<00:02:31.080> cooler<00:02:31.410> considering

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this is a very beefy cooler considering

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.790 
this is a very beefy cooler considering
that<00:02:32.850> even<00:02:33.090> though<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.870> enthusiast

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that even though this is a an enthusiast

directly contacted by the unison and in

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.770 
directly contacted by the unison and in

providing extra cooling to those that do
so<00:03:09.990> that's<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.290> very<00:03:10.500> neat<00:03:10.740> design<00:03:11.070> choice<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
so that's a very neat design choice I

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160 
so that's a very neat design choice I
actually<00:03:11.550> haven't<00:03:11.910> seen<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.450> before<00:03:12.570> it

FINRA's<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.700> either<00:03:42.269> side<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.290> fan<00:03:43.500> itself

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
FINRA's on either side of the fan itself

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.280 
FINRA's on either side of the fan itself
so<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.580> how<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> GPU<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.690> getting<00:03:45.989> cooled

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so that is how the GPU is getting cooled

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.440 
so that is how the GPU is getting cooled
they<00:03:46.830> yeah<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.700> said<00:03:47.730> they're<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.209> good<00:03:48.360> at

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
they yeah like I said they're so good at

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.850 
they yeah like I said they're so good at
this<00:03:48.570> check<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.110> we've<00:03:49.350> got<00:03:49.530> another

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
this check this out so we've got another

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.350 
this check this out so we've got another
metal<00:03:50.280> brushed<00:03:50.970> piece<00:03:51.300> which<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.709> Radeon<00:03:52.709> red

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
metal brushed piece which is Radeon red

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.570 
metal brushed piece which is Radeon red
is<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.570> AMD<00:03:55.050> red<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.530> mean<00:03:55.860> AMD's<00:03:56.220> color<00:03:56.459> has

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
is it AMD red I mean AMD's color has

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.949 
is it AMD red I mean AMD's color has
never<00:03:56.730> been<00:03:56.850> red<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.269> they're<00:03:57.390> still<00:03:57.540> using

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
never been red but they're still using

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.810 
never been red but they're still using
the<00:03:58.080> ATI<00:03:58.410> red<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> graphics<00:03:59.370> cards<00:03:59.670> which

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
configurations from this card it makes

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.410 
configurations from this card it makes
sense<00:04:14.250> because<00:04:14.489> honestly<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.150> you're<00:04:15.269> buying

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
sense because honestly if you're buying

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.390 
sense because honestly if you're buying
three<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.180> step-down<00:04:18.690> GPUs<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:20.190> should

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
three so to step-down GPUs you should

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
three so to step-down GPUs you should
probably<00:04:20.700> just<00:04:20.940> be<00:04:21.239> buying<00:04:21.450> one<00:04:21.600> or<00:04:21.900> two

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
probably just be buying one or two

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.810 
probably just be buying one or two
higher<00:04:22.470> end<00:04:22.740> ones<00:04:22.770> instead<00:04:23.340> because<00:04:23.640> it's

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
higher end ones instead because it's

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.200 
higher end ones instead because it's
going<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.150> yield<00:04:24.300> better<00:04:24.600> perform

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
going to yield better perform

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.270 
going to yield better perform
it's<00:04:25.449> due<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.169> way<00:04:26.289> that<00:04:26.500> crossfire<00:04:27.039> and

it's due to the way that crossfire and

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
this is a two gigabyte graphics card

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.339 
this is a two gigabyte graphics card
which<00:04:33.970> means<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.569> is<00:04:34.720> more<00:04:34.750> than<00:04:35.139> capable

of driving slightly older games and by
older<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.210> don't<00:04:40.479> mean<00:04:40.660> like<00:04:40.900> three<00:04:41.349> four<00:04:41.740> years

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979

older I don't mean like three four years
old<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.340> mean<00:04:42.490> like<00:04:42.729> sort<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.090> last<00:04:43.360> year<00:04:43.690> six

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
old I mean like sort of last year six

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.110 
old I mean like sort of last year six
months<00:04:44.289> ago<00:04:44.410> like<00:04:44.710> current<00:04:45.400> generation<00:04:46.000> as

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
months ago like current generation as

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.089 
months ago like current generation as
well<00:04:46.270> as<00:04:46.419> older<00:04:46.660> games<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:47.139> extremely<00:04:47.949> high

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
well as older games at extremely high

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.010 
well as older games at extremely high
resolution<00:04:48.819> so<00:04:49.000> having<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.419> extra<00:04:49.690> graphics

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
resolution so having that extra graphics

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.080 
resolution so having that extra graphics
memory<00:04:50.560> makes<00:04:51.310> all<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.639> difference<00:04:51.729> in<00:04:52.030> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
memory makes all the difference in the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.370 
memory makes all the difference in the
world<00:04:52.300> because<00:04:52.569> you<00:04:52.690> have<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.930> load<00:04:53.080> all<00:04:53.229> the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
world because you have to load all the

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.529 
world because you have to load all the
textures<00:04:53.830> into<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> memory<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.030> even<00:04:55.330> if<00:04:55.449> you

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
textures into the memory so even if you

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.059

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
have a high performance card that's

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.939 
have a high performance card that's
maybe<00:04:57.699> from<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.419> competition<00:04:59.349> say<00:04:59.650> like<00:04:59.919> a

as<00:05:07.210> soon<00:05:07.539> as<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.840> start<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.620> increase<00:05:09.220> the

as soon as you start to increase the
resolution<00:05:09.550> beyond<00:05:10.449> a<00:05:10.750> single<00:05:11.139> monitor<00:05:11.560> so

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
resolution beyond a single monitor so

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.070 
resolution beyond a single monitor so
what<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.370> means<00:05:12.639> is<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:12.910> this<00:05:13.449> monitor<00:05:13.900> or

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
what that means is that this monitor or

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.320 
what that means is that this monitor or
this<00:05:14.259> card<00:05:14.650> not<00:05:15.130> only<00:05:15.370> supports<00:05:15.849> up<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.120> four

performance difference whatsoever so

basically good pricing good performance
and<00:05:57.250> really<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.300> reason<00:05:58.780> I'm<00:05:58.900> doing<00:05:59.020> this

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
and really the reason I'm doing this

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.719 
and really the reason I'm doing this
unboxing<00:05:59.680> is<00:05:59.770> because<00:05:59.949> I<00:06:00.039> really<00:06:00.310> needed<00:06:00.490> one

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
unboxing is because I really needed one

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.950 
unboxing is because I really needed one
so<00:06:00.909> that<00:06:01.030> I<00:06:01.090> could<00:06:01.240> test<00:06:01.419> it<00:06:01.539> against<00:06:01.900> the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
so that I could test it against the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.860 
so that I could test it against the
upcoming<00:06:02.500> GTX<00:06:03.370> all<00:06:04.330> wait<00:06:04.539> I<00:06:04.570> should<00:06:04.780> probably

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
upcoming GTX all wait I should probably

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.330 
upcoming GTX all wait I should probably
shouldn't<00:06:05.259> say<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:05.560> that<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.860> can<00:06:05.979> release<00:06:06.219> this

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
shouldn't say so that I can release this

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.920 
shouldn't say so that I can release this
