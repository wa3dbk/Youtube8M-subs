00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.790 
yesterday I also have the TRD dog-bone
rear<00:00:17.000> motor<00:00:17.240> mounts<00:00:17.660> installed<00:00:18.289> as<00:00:18.440> well<00:00:18.590> but

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
rear motor mounts installed as well but

that<00:00:18.920> one's<00:00:19.100> already<00:00:19.279> broken<00:00:19.609> in<00:00:20.350> the

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
that one's already broken in the

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.320 
that one's already broken in the
vibrations<00:00:22.010> from<00:00:22.100> that<00:00:22.279> have<00:00:22.430> worn<00:00:22.640> off<00:00:22.820> it's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
vibrations from that have worn off it's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.700

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
little bit of noise that it leaves

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.349 
little bit of noise that it leaves
throughout<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.779> cabin<00:00:26.960> but<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.039> tears<00:00:29.029> the

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
throughout the cabin but the tears the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.720 
throughout the cabin but the tears the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
tranny motor the tranny mount is still

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.639 
tranny motor the tranny mount is still
given<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.719> lot<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:32.960> vibration<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:33.500> is

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
given a lot of vibration this is

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.700 
given a lot of vibration this is
actually<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.070> stock<00:00:34.340> one<00:00:35.290> this<00:00:36.290> is<00:00:36.500> what

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
actually the stock one this is what

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.430 
actually the stock one this is what
Mazda<00:00:37.160> had<00:00:37.280> replaced<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.540> OEM<00:00:39.200> mount

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
Mazda had replaced this is the OEM mount

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.380 
Mazda had replaced this is the OEM mount
it<00:00:39.620> was<00:00:39.710> just<00:00:39.860> replaced<00:00:40.160> maybe<00:00:40.460> not<00:00:40.910> even<00:00:41.090> 100

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
it was just replaced maybe not even 100

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.119 
it was just replaced maybe not even 100
miles<00:00:41.600> ago

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
miles ago

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.119 
miles ago
it's<00:00:43.850> kind<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:44.149> flimsy<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.750> middle<00:00:45.129> that's

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
it's kind of flimsy in the middle that's

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.430 
it's kind of flimsy in the middle that's
what<00:00:46.370> was<00:00:46.550> uh<00:00:46.579> giving<00:00:47.329> me<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.539> clunks<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.989> guess

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
what was uh giving me the clunks I guess

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.869 
what was uh giving me the clunks I guess
I<00:00:48.530> should<00:00:48.710> mention<00:00:48.860> it's<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.309> it's<00:00:49.640> the

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
I should mention it's a it's the

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.729 
I should mention it's a it's the
automatic<00:00:50.539> transmission<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.260> don't<00:00:51.410> have<00:00:51.530> the

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
automatic transmission I don't have the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.180 
automatic transmission I don't have the
the<00:00:52.309> manual<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.879> here<00:00:53.120> but<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.390> does<00:00:53.539> make<00:00:53.750> a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the manual on here but it does make a

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.799 
the manual on here but it does make a
decent<00:00:55.190> improvement<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.000> shifting<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.600> lot

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
decent improvement the shifting is a lot

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.360 
decent improvement the shifting is a lot
quicker<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.620> automatic<00:00:58.070> transmission

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
quicker of the automatic transmission

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.920 
quicker of the automatic transmission
especially<00:00:59.000> when<00:00:59.120> you<00:00:59.210> put<00:00:59.359> it<00:00:59.480> into<00:00:59.629> the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
especially when you put it into the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.290 
especially when you put it into the
sport<00:01:00.649> shift<00:01:00.920> mode<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.850> seems<00:01:02.030> a<00:01:02.090> little<00:01:02.149> bit

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
sport shift mode it seems a little bit

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.960 
sport shift mode it seems a little bit
more<00:01:02.420> responsive<00:01:03.170> there's<00:01:04.100> no<00:01:04.250> more<00:01:04.430> clunking

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
more responsive there's no more clunking

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.270 
more responsive there's no more clunking
or<00:01:05.210> like<00:01:05.449> dragging<00:01:05.990> kind<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.380> feeling<00:01:06.710> it's

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
or like dragging kind of feeling it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.530 
or like dragging kind of feeling it's
very<00:01:07.490> solid<00:01:07.729> does<00:01:08.150> leave<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.390> lot<00:01:08.420> of

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
very solid does leave a lot of

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.780 
very solid does leave a lot of
vibrations<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:09.380> there<00:01:09.590> are<00:01:09.799> they're<00:01:10.610> good

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
vibrations but there are they're good

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.330 
vibrations but there are they're good
vibrations<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.600> let's<00:01:11.810> uh<00:01:11.900> give<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:12.860> quick

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
vibrations so let's uh give it a quick

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:24.600 
vibrations so let's uh give it a quick
startup

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.610 

I<00:01:24.810> don't<00:01:25.810> know<00:01:25.900> if<00:01:25.990> it's<00:01:26.110> gonna<00:01:26.200> come<00:01:26.470> out

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
I don't know if it's gonna come out

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.920 
I don't know if it's gonna come out
sound<00:01:27.550> wise<00:01:27.820> but<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.150> can<00:01:28.330> even<00:01:28.660> hear<00:01:28.900> a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
sound wise but you can even hear a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.700 
sound wise but you can even hear a
little<00:01:29.110> bit<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.380> panel<00:01:30.340> vibrations<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.530> not

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
little bit of panel vibrations it's not

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.160 
little bit of panel vibrations it's not
bad<00:01:32.950> though<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.790> think<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.600> noticed<00:01:34.750> more

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
bad though it's I think I noticed more

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.280 
bad though it's I think I noticed more
when<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.350> did<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.860> rear<00:01:36.010> mount<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:37.150> one<00:01:37.360> that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290
