00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
with four victories but when I think by

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.320 
with four victories but when I think by
winning<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.160> national<00:00:11.309> championship<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.240> all

comes down to experience there's nothing

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.379 
comes down to experience there's nothing
like<00:00:14.549> having<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.969> national<00:00:15.330> championship

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389

already in your back pocket and that is

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.760 
already in your back pocket and that is
certainly<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.360> case<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.810> Kirk<00:00:18.990> Olson<00:00:19.439> he's

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

Jones<00:00:44.070> had<00:00:44.280> his<00:00:44.399> way<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.059> time<00:00:45.269> I'm

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
Jones had his way but this time I'm

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.489 
Jones had his way but this time I'm
really<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> give<00:00:46.140> him<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.320> much

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
really going to give him as much

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.439 
really going to give him as much
pressure<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.859> possible<00:00:47.399> there's<00:00:47.909> six<00:00:48.210> tenths

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
pressure as possible there's six tenths

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.989 
pressure as possible there's six tenths
of<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> difference<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.499> qualifying<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.489> I'll

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
of a difference in qualifying so I'll

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.849 
of a difference in qualifying so I'll
say<00:00:51.179> a<00:00:51.210> both<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.960> their<00:00:52.379> work<00:00:52.679> cut

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
say a both of them have their work cut

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.340 
say a both of them have their work cut
out<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.249> next<00:00:53.399> 20<00:00:53.640> laps

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
out for the next 20 laps
and<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.519> more<00:00:56.760> from<00:00:57.000> downstairs<00:00:57.480> by

third<00:04:48.690> right<00:04:48.990> now<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.620> you've<00:04:49.740> got<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:49.980> give

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
third right now and you've got to give

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.860 
third right now and you've got to give
Olson<00:04:50.370> all<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.700> credit<00:04:51.030> after<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.420> spin<00:04:51.660> I

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
Olson all the credit after the spin I

figured<00:04:52.470> Calvin<00:04:52.800> he<00:04:52.860> had<00:04:52.980> fallen<00:04:53.190> back

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
figured Calvin he had fallen back

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.150 
figured Calvin he had fallen back
perhaps<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:54.300> 12th<00:04:54.780> or<00:04:54.900> 13th<00:04:54.930> spot<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:56.070> would

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
perhaps to 12th or 13th spot that would

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.950 
perhaps to 12th or 13th spot that would
mean<00:04:56.280> he's<00:04:56.430> gained<00:04:56.700> in<00:04:57.030> 8th<00:04:57.180> position<00:04:57.390> so

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
mean he's gained in 8th position so

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.900 
mean he's gained in 8th position so
funny<00:04:58.230> County<00:04:58.740> has<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.010> fastest<00:04:59.520> lap<00:04:59.700> the

turkle's it all over for second spot
yeah<00:06:26.979> Olson<00:06:27.310> has<00:06:27.400> already<00:06:27.729> cleared

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
yeah Olson has already cleared

yeah Olson has already cleared
Baumgartner<00:06:28.840> from<00:06:29.020> when<00:06:29.139> they<00:06:29.259> lost<00:06:29.500> went<00:06:29.740> by

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
Baumgartner from when they lost went by

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.890 
Baumgartner from when they lost went by
the<00:06:29.919> pits<00:06:30.220> there<00:06:30.490> so<00:06:30.789> he's<00:06:31.210> gone<00:06:31.389> already<00:06:31.509> put

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
the pits there so he's gone already put

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.420 
the pits there so he's gone already put
the<00:06:31.990> pressure<00:06:32.229> on<00:06:32.440> now<00:06:32.770> and<00:06:32.979> see<00:06:33.129> if<00:06:33.220> he<00:06:33.310> can

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
the pressure on now and see if he can

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.100 
the pressure on now and see if he can
take<00:06:33.610> that<00:06:33.669> silver<00:06:34.120> metal<00:06:34.449> position<00:06:34.780> away<00:06:34.960> and

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
take that silver metal position away and

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.930 
take that silver metal position away and
he<00:06:35.169> tucks<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.560> to<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.770> inside<00:06:36.099> they<00:06:36.580> come<00:06:36.789> out

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
he tucks it to the inside they come out

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.640 
he tucks it to the inside they come out
for<00:06:37.090> nine<00:06:37.300> he's<00:06:37.509> got<00:06:37.659> more<00:06:37.840> horsepower<00:06:37.990> he

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
for nine he's got more horsepower he

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.290 
for nine he's got more horsepower he
should<00:06:38.889> be<00:06:39.039> in<00:06:39.129> a<00:06:39.220> good<00:06:39.340> track<00:06:39.580> position<00:06:40.090> there

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
should be in a good track position there

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.270 
should be in a good track position there
and<00:06:40.509> right<00:06:40.930> this<00:06:41.199> lets<00:06:41.440> him<00:06:41.590> Allen<00:06:41.889> nothing<00:06:42.190> he

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
and right this lets him Allen nothing he

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.920 
and right this lets him Allen nothing he
can<00:06:42.460> do<00:06:42.639> crane<00:06:42.940> will<00:06:43.090> block<00:06:43.240> that<00:06:43.419> corner<00:06:43.750> good

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
can do crane will block that corner good

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.629 
can do crane will block that corner good

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
really kept his head together there and

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.790 
really kept his head together there and
there<00:06:49.690> he<00:06:49.810> gets<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:50.080> little<00:06:50.259> bit<00:06:50.469> wide<00:06:50.770> there

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
there he gets a little bit wide there
