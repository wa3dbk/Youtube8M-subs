00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.350
 it remains as a friend this must share 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.240
 Serviu this issue with this tweet 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.940
 we are going to totally change the 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.709
 interface and let's see how it looks apart 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.049
 of other options that he gives us that is 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.000
 very very good this has a price of 3 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.349
 dollars with 99 cents and here you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.060
 we install we will give a reset 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.039
 fast and in adjustments we will create a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.630
 new menu but before going to the menu 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 You can see here how I see the new 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.159
 interface and we can throw it to the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.210
 speed we want for the side that 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:35.030
 we want and make it the same bigger or 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.190
 smaller there can see 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.850
 then here I am going to turn it a little 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.550
 Quick 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.609
 let's give it 5 kilometers fast 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.309
 hour 50 kilometers per hour 10 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.620
 kilometers per hour and one kilometer 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.089
 when there is there and as you can see 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.579
 we from here we can open 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.469
 our applications and all that other 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.629
 thing we do if we want to eliminate 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 some application in this case I'm going to 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.130
 put this fifa 15 I'm going to 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.260
 keep the application pressed 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.420
 and you can see that I get that if the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.730
 we want to eliminate and then already as a city 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.830
 we want to eliminate the remote flag and it 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.990
 is going to eliminate or is it a new one 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.330
 way to remove separate applications 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.310
 this tweet also comes with its search engine 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.680
 we are going to slide down 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 our finger but even if it's not inside 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.720
 of the sphere of the icons or in another 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.300
 we are going to analyze it and can see 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.940
 how we get the search engine already there can 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.330
 see we slide our finger and do not know the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.440
 see something else in the dock that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.869
 we can put a dock of 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.660
 notifications or a 2 with the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.759
 recent applications but there are also 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.530
 you can see it and right now I have nothing 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.170
 the notifications and I do not have any 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.650
 and it would be very nice also the dow 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.119
 which is compatible with transparent taxi 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.729
 we can install there if we use 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.190
 some if you see that here is locked 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.170
 a little bit the sphere when it gives is because 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.910
 I am transmitting my screen of the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.619
 iphone to the mac but I really do not know 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.960
 worked when you try it they go 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.300
 to see and good and here we see what everything 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.280
 that does this we're going to go to adjustments and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.850
 let's see the options here you can see 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.950
 the settings 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.040
 says disabled if we activate 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 disable is because it will be disabled 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.060
 we have to have disabled 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.400
 that option and with the rounds if 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.700
 we want and as a round we select the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.620
 first the first option high label 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.420
 hide the text to me I do not like the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 text that's why I hid it and if we want 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 hide the dock then the third the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.390
 we activate but if we have activated the 2 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.870
 Well here we have other options in 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:42.280
 disabled room in 16 back here we 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 this option is recommended that the one 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.200
 we have activated that we activate them on 1 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 and envers to see the adjustments here we have 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.240
 the dock then here we can 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.640
 edit it and if we want to have the 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.110
 recent applications also together with 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.970
 Notifications for nothing more 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.890
 we drag but in this case only 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.150
 I want to have the notifications if I do not 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.250
 we want none then nothing else 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.880
 we deactivate the dock and can see now 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.280
 I set my notifications to go and activate the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.740
 disabled option this is so that we 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.200
 last longer the battery and they will see that no 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.970
 we spend too much battery this trick and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.700
 Well, good friends, these are all 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.070
