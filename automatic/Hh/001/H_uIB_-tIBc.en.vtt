600<00:00:05.759> jewelcrafting<00:00:06.500> it's<00:00:07.500> actually<00:00:07.799> rather

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
600 jewelcrafting it's actually rather

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.759 
600 jewelcrafting it's actually rather
easy<00:00:08.389> but<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.599> feel<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.929> not<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.260> good<00:00:10.410> for

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
easy but I feel it's not as good for

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.310 
easy but I feel it's not as good for
like<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> min<00:00:11.429> maxing<00:00:11.849> Raider<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.360> PvP<00:00:13.049> ER<00:00:13.080> as

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
like the min maxing Raider or PvP ER as

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.220 
like the min maxing Raider or PvP ER as
it<00:00:13.500> was<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.009> previous<00:00:14.580> expansion<00:00:15.000> packs

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.630 
anyways I I bought about 2,000 gold
worth<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.960> ghosts<00:00:19.230> iron<00:00:19.470> ore<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.920> started

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
worth of ghosts iron ore and started

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150 
worth of ghosts iron ore and started
prospecting<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.539> 525<00:00:22.289> jewelcrafting<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
prospecting it at 525 jewelcrafting I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
prospecting it at 525 jewelcrafting I
don't<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.939> prospect<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> before

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
don't know if you can prospect it before

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
don't know if you can prospect it before
then<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:26.369> definitely<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.820> way<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
then but that's definitely the way that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.339 
then but that's definitely the way that
I<00:00:27.119> would<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.930> you'll<00:00:28.109> have

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I would do it because then you'll have

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439 
I would do it because then you'll have
some<00:00:28.710> rare<00:00:29.039> gems<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.550> well<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.029> use<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
some rare gems as well to use for the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.410 
some rare gems as well to use for the
next<00:00:30.660> step<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.019> guide<00:00:31.460> anyways<00:00:32.460> at<00:00:32.730> 525

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
at 585 you want to start doing gem

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180 
at 585 you want to start doing gem
research<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> gem<00:00:55.379> research<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
research and gem research is where you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
research and gem research is where you
take<00:00:56.370> three<00:00:56.760> gems<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.629> color<00:00:57.870> three<00:00:58.440> rare

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
take three gems of one color three rare

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
take three gems of one color three rare
gems<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.219> color<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> it'll<00:01:00.539> teach<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
gems of one color and it'll teach you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
gems of one color and it'll teach you
how<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> make<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.530> new<00:01:02.129> rare<00:01:02.399> gem<00:01:02.670> cut<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.690> gem

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
how to make a new rare gem cut of a gem

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
how to make a new rare gem cut of a gem
of<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.170> color<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.729> three<00:01:06.090> red

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
of that color so if you use three red

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.130 
of that color so if you use three red
gems<00:01:06.570> it'll<00:01:06.900> teach<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> rare<00:01:07.740> red<00:01:08.220> gem<00:01:08.520> cut

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
gems it'll teach you a rare red gem cut

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
gems it'll teach you a rare red gem cut
the<00:01:10.140> research<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> one-day<00:01:11.760> cool<00:01:12.030> down

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the research is on a one-day cool down

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
the research is on a one-day cool down
per<00:01:12.540> color<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> spirit

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
per color but you can also use a spirit

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.999 
per color but you can also use a spirit
of<00:01:14.790> harmonies<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> bypass<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.049> three<00:01:16.740> spirit

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
of harmonies to bypass this three spirit

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
of harmonies to bypass this three spirit
of<00:01:17.070> harmonies<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:18.090> let<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of harmonies will also let you do a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
of harmonies will also let you do a
research<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.259> it'll<00:01:19.530> teach<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> random

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
research and it'll teach you a random

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.600 
research and it'll teach you a random
color<00:01:20.790> gem<00:01:21.270> cut<00:01:21.860> every<00:01:22.860> time<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
color gem cut every time you do a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
color gem cut every time you do a
research<00:01:24.090> you'll<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> facet<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> research

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
research you'll get a facet of research

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.950 
research you'll get a facet of research
which<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.450> bit<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> gold<00:01:27.810> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
which will have a little bit of gold in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
which will have a little bit of gold in
it<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> it'll<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.670> couple<00:01:30.030> rare

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it and it'll also have a couple rare

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
it and it'll also have a couple rare
gems<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.869> resell<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> can

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
gems that you can resell so you can

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.170 
gems that you can resell so you can
actually<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.610> money<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.909> pretty

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
actually make your money back pretty

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually make your money back pretty
much<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.430> after<00:01:35.430> doing<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
much when you do this after doing the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
much when you do this after doing the
initial<00:01:35.939> research<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.659> costs<00:01:36.900> three<00:01:37.290> rare

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
initial research which costs three rare

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
initial research which costs three rare
gems<00:01:37.920> it'll<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.610> another<00:01:38.909> six<00:01:39.240> rare<00:01:39.479> gems<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
gems it'll take another six rare gems to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
gems it'll take another six rare gems to
hit<00:01:40.110> 600<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.210> all

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
hit 600 from that and that's really all

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.319 
hit 600 from that and that's really all
