00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 noticed that many cars as 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 mileage increases worse and worse 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.300
 obey the steering doubly sad if 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.550
 fine tuning of the chassis does not give the desired 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.560
 result how to achieve the same 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.490
 steering feel and proper stability 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 if your car 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.020
 prowling from side to side especially on 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.760
 uneven road profiles somehow manage 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.050
 such a car first tiresomely 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.300
 and secondly unsafe 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.279
 if you are sure about the exact settings 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 highway parameters and your confidence 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.690
 confirmed by reliable printout 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.730
 proven stand then causes yaw 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.440
 may be tired of urinals and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.969
 salenblocks 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
 I remind you that silent blocks are called 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 elastic rubber-metal bushings 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.649
 who mostly work on 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 twisting 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.820
 perhaps the most loaded silent blocks 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.840
 are in the lugs of the lower arms 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 front suspension 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.210
 when the sleeves are fine they are excellent 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 hold the lever horizontal plane and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370
 at the same time provides a clear course 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 wheels vertically as a result when 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 driving over bumps toe 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.790
 virtually unchanged and on the steering wheel you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 always feel feedback from 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.990
 smoothly increasing effort but if the steering wheel 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.119
 not naturally easy and the car 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.970
 sways from side to side here 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.470
 need to check the status of silent blocks 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.049
 can you just lay something on the ground 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 go under the car and alternately attach 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 fingers like front and back eyelet 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.100
 lower arm at this time your assistant 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.259
 or assistant must intensively swing 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.090
 driving left while running 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.799
 engine 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 unnecessarily and malleability 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.610
 rubber sleeves 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.350
 clearly felt and visible 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.079
 the reason lies on the surface on the broken 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.329
 our roads are a simple example 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.579
 if you take a new rubber metal 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 bushing and hammer it for a long time then 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.119
 it will naturally soften and crack 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.670
 think now 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.619
 how many hard kicks every minute 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.229
 ride time gets everyone healed 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.119
 blog is not surprising that even on such 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
 strong details gradually formed 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.219
 tears and microcracks once u 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.680
 leverage additional degree appears 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.780
 freedom and the wheel together ball bearing 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 begins to walk cooking up and down 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 there can be no sustainability 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.410
 speech because when driving over bumps 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.870
 the convergence goes to a minus 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 in plus and the car sways from the side in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 side this is in dynamics on the go a in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.250
 static can repeat everything 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 Ideal replacement limp on the bestowed 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.940
 saline blocks and fine tuning of angles 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.560
 wheel mounting as a rule 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.530
 restore the ability of the machine 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.240
 hold on to the road remember 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.070
 your car should always be 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.170
 debugged and configured as good 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.820
 musical instrument happy you 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.820
 driving pleasure
