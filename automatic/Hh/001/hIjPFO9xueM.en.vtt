filming this I'll just tell you IRL the
only<00:03:49.709> reason<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.070> film<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> don't

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
only reason I film it so that I don't

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.910 
only reason I film it so that I don't
have<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.239> come<00:03:51.390> over<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.660> your<00:03:51.720> house<00:03:51.930> because

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
have to come over to your house because

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.440 
have to come over to your house because
your<00:03:53.100> house<00:03:53.220> smells<00:03:53.640> too<00:03:53.820> much<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.120> muffins

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
your house smells too much like muffins

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.870 
your house smells too much like muffins
and<00:03:54.690> I'm<00:03:54.930> trying<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> cut<00:03:55.380> down<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:56.250> these

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
and I'm trying to cut down just these

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:10.930 
and I'm trying to cut down just these
cheeks<00:03:57.239> you're<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.440> chubby

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.970
