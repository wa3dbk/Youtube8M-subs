00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 it is already something like tradition 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
 it is hardly getting cold outside again 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.620
 we do not test foto equipment in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 things cameras and lenses but 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.800
 everything that belongs to it today 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.440
 we have a preprint again 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.490
 it is very old 46 of if that is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.929
 the good thing with it a bit 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 what of it in know what he's got 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:25.140
 I would say just let go with a few 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 the reviews before going to the place which one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.439
 in the backpack exactly pure can 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 a small special bag for the first time 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 shown up here could be for 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 for example, gps trackers or smartphones 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 like in this case and you have to say 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 injury use so relative 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 Big appliances we ten times lumia 925 or 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.020
 Everything fit for the tablet area 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.250
 has not really good in that can 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 the corners already partly and again in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 but otherwise the zipper will grow 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.590
 for smaller smartphones iphone what also 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 always a very good idea that you can 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 there can only clean in from the height of it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800
 has not positioned quite so favorably 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 Of course, what's more important is what 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.649
 I get our photo printing then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 really into equipment and there 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 The real 46 offers some look us 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 So just make a quick reference to what you do 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 Immediately you realize you have so much 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.619
 This plastic click encrypted 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.840
 Hesse is not in any case 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 unintentionally but we look 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 just into the interior 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 because you could tell there's definitely 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 every amount of space 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.939
 if you see it here you have it first 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.229
 top again such a kind day pack that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 means you get beside but 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.290
 included bag everything possible 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.500
 For example, I have a filter pocket 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.430
 notebook is still in it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 replacement batteries for example for ours 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.579
 radio link and and so smallest 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.780
 got the wonderful or if you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.750
 on the hike side a bit eat 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.340
 or something fits in any case perfect for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 Interior itself you see that already 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.939
 whole is again freely configurable 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
 you have a lot of these 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899
 Partitions also with soon so can 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.320
 Interior as you want 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.000
 in experience , for example 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.799
 relatively many out because I'm bigger 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 Objectives have such as 70 since 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
 200 of canon we have at the last 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420
 video also shown that you get 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.890
 for example, such here if you like 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.119
 We must have more small objectives with us 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.189
 Can you stop it here ? 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.170
 Sort by how funny he is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.850
 the camera comes as you can see 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 actually quite a good reason here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 if you are the whole time to the side 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 rotate pages so you still have intervened 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 you do it all up 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 are already there could be nice of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.310
 the side still arrive approaching well 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.989
 You can make memory cards here 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.400
 So at least super accommodate 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.260
 special memory cards pÃ©cs is that 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.730
 whole very well suited completely 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.830
 maybe fits or sd memory cards 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.750
 Everyone had both from the outside again 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.040
 just like that for his batteries or something 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.530
 could take that very well so for 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.239
 listening ensured in any case key 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.410
 portmonee and and and I have that now 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.970
 for example, here in front of me 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.459
 housed and this relatively small 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.930
 bag that is still there and if 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.519
 you then continue on the way down 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.930
 is you have again a multiple accessories 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.819
 What I do quite well, I think 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.799
 at least if you flashlight now 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.299
 at lance penh in the case and and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.829
 So again shows very small that gets 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.760
 you really down here wonderful and 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.650
 you can see it even if that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.849
 smartphone as I said not above 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.530
 This extra bag fits in actually 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.940
 in rome still shows more than enough 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.940
 place and get that under it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.600
 Of course you want today even when 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.610
 take pictures of a bit of multimedia 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.490
 have equipment with it offers the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.680
 series 46 also fans for it purely 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.630
 For example, look at a tray 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.550
 So 8 to almost ten inches maximum goes 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.680
 still pure and even more if 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.730
 you want to have in notebook could 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.860
 just send here we make 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.750
 13.3 inch notebook really fits 1 you 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.670
 into it should not be too thick so 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.440
 I fit these 2 34 cm notebooks 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.590
 I would be really good in too much 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.400
 hard to take away 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.110
 of course always very important 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.610
 I can still get a tripod to the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.260
 backpack somehow iran just when i 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.600
 At night, product also has many similar things 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 would you like to have it work 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.320
 of course also look at the 46 too 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.030
 always a bit down to the backpack 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.410
 what we have here and that again 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.780
 you see already a marker at the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.540
 small tripod oh what's in there 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.950
 hidden and have to get out relatively - 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.750
 This time also here can 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.910
 tripod legs in here up there 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.590
 about this closure, so to speak firmly 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.420
 mount you have the tripod here 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.010
 beautiful inside and there is also, of course, 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.200
 again from who has a small one 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.390
 Special offer to the backpack or to 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.530
 tripod we have already tested that if 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.070
 BIOPRO 283 cgh before roughly six 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.200
 months 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.300
 if it gets there deep gets the photos 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.560
 says for free that means group 200 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.690
 Just saved it 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.130
 You can find more infos here below 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.360
 the video description in it and 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.310
 Of course you also want to be linked 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.020
 article on our website 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.760
 if you liked the video then 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.320
 also like to visit us 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.390
 other test videos from the field 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.580
 photo accessories for example once from 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.830
 at the beginning of the year when the biopro 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.690
 I already mentioned that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.520
 tripod you could see what you are there 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.050
 so you can expect all or 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.290
 still fresher the video of the 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.820
 ifa 2013 tested the adapter 46h 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.040
 a bit compact photo backpack too 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.050
 again a lot cheaper with just under 79 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.550
 Both of them are definitely very 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.990
 interesting says look over 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.990
 if you want and see you 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.310
 somehow still five drivers then 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.770
 Can I turn the flashlight on? 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.330
 And the countries would have to deal with the product 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.960
 sometimes you have to test again 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.419
 to click 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.419
 he should tell times before how many
