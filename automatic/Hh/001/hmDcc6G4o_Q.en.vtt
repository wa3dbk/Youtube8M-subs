back up hello oh no you didn't Oh will
it<00:03:06.349> keep<00:03:06.470> stacking<00:03:07.010> apparently<00:03:07.459> interesting

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
it keep stacking apparently interesting

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.250 
it keep stacking apparently interesting
a<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:10.400> when<00:03:10.639> I'm<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.970> keep<00:03:11.569> go<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.109> and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
a little when I'm to keep go on it and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.990 
a little when I'm to keep go on it and
you<00:03:12.620> wanted<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:12.950> bounce<00:03:13.159> with<00:03:13.430> your<00:03:13.549> time<00:03:13.760> so

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
you wanted to bounce with your time so

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.990 
you wanted to bounce with your time so
that<00:03:14.150> when<00:03:14.329> it<00:03:14.420> gets<00:03:14.690> back<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:14.989> him<00:03:15.819> he<00:03:16.819> takes

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
that when it gets back to him he takes

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.300 
that when it gets back to him he takes
more<00:03:17.299> damage<00:03:17.720> free<00:03:17.930> because<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.040> how<00:03:19.159> many

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
more damage free because of how many

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.460 
more damage free because of how many
times<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.639> fountain

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.210 

and<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:24.300> reason<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.810> why<00:03:25.050> because<00:03:25.620> well<00:03:25.980> I

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and the reason is why because well I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.650 
and the reason is why because well I
guess<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.610> could<00:03:26.640> keep<00:03:26.850> doing<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.390> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
guess you could keep doing this but it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.990 
guess you could keep doing this but it
really<00:03:27.840> depends<00:03:28.170> on<00:03:28.290> dealer<00:03:28.530> mana<00:03:28.860> right<00:03:29.550> this

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
really depends on dealer mana right this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.700 
really depends on dealer mana right this
is<00:03:30.210> somewhat<00:03:30.870> healing<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.290> looked<00:03:31.560> only

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
is somewhat healing I looked only

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.390 
is somewhat healing I looked only
ticking<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.400> 10k<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:34.830> not<00:03:35.130> that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
ticking for 10k it's really not that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.170 
ticking for 10k it's really not that

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.900 

someone<00:05:09.040> will<00:05:09.130> need<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.370> take<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.610> beginning

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
someone will need to take the beginning

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.050 
someone will need to take the beginning
of<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.060> next<00:05:10.150> one<00:05:10.360> if<00:05:10.480> he<00:05:10.600> lives<00:05:11.820> but<00:05:12.820> yeah<00:05:13.030> I

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
of the next one if he lives but yeah I

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.370 
of the next one if he lives but yeah I
just<00:05:13.240> figured<00:05:13.630> hitting<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.080> better<00:05:14.230> than

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
just figured hitting it is better than

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.720 
just figured hitting it is better than
losing<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.920> one<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.220> we<00:05:15.280> could<00:05:15.430> kill<00:05:15.640> him

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
losing that one and we could kill him

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.970 
losing that one and we could kill him
yeah<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:16.840> maybe<00:05:17.020> sometimes<00:05:17.560> you<00:05:17.650> might<00:05:17.800> have
