00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.300
Solar energy system is usually set up on the top of a roof.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.640
Nowadays, solar energy system is installed in a module looks like building material,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.140
so it can be installed outside of a building. The numbers of a patent on this type of system are increasing

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.480
Here is Jihae Oh reporter.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.140
This is a big market which has 43m2 side surface.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.580
Both sides of a building are covered with about 2000 solar modules.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.580
They use this solar energy system modules as outside building materials.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.920
It supplies energy to the building as an integral style system on a building.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.920
The outside module gets solar energy, and it produces direct current power.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.680
Then it is changed to alternating current power, so people can use it.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.640
We could save money for building materials.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.000
It also brings the artistic beauty to the building ,so we set it up.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.900
The energy is used for public parking, light, and electronic display.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.000
Previous solar energy system modules were set on the top of a roof.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.120
but this module can be used outside building material.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.880
This integral style system on a building is increasing, and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
In 2007, the number of a patent are increased up t0 200 cases.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.260
When we look at the patent technical fields, there are

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.600
supporting structure 53 cases, dye sensitized solar cell 26 cases,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.360
sight-see extension 25 cases and changing light direction 19 cases.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.460
The government tries to use solar energy to solve electric power shortage.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.040
The needs of solar integral style system will keep increasing.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.960
Applying a patent will be very important.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.720
Not only for producing electric power but also duality as a building

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.280
material function are needed. And we need more technical development.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.300
This is JiHye Oh from Industry news.
