00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.490
 with all friends here it will be done and good 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.910
 I must tell you that jokingly 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.740
 I missed a lot not normal the truth 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.839
 is that I had years of not uploading a video 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.540
 of black ops 2 and above all also a 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.789
 video about 3 or 4 days but still for 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.369
 what I was going up believe me that is 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.019
 an eternity and good more than anything 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.730
 friends I want to tell you that all this 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.220
 Well, you know, it's been a product 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.349
 of the university tasks etcetera but 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.019
 I feel that it is not badly taken advantage of 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.609
 otherwise it is for my good and good for 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.890
 all of you who are my subscribers 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.890
 loyal I want to thank you if you 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.860
 they will be with me in this new as 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 it is said not no plan of life but how it is 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.520
 in a new stage of my life not because 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.740
 I'm not absent but I'm not either 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.600
 as present as I had been doing 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.210
 I think that right now it's going up 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.650
 a couple of videos per week I still go 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.080
 to try that each one is of quality 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.080
 if it is either a gameplay an emblem 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.730
 or sometimes a gameplay a blog or sometimes 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.130
 two emblems that yes what I go 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.680
 emerging but always of quality and 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.350
 also trying to be present about 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.360
 all on facebook 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.009
 because now facebook is where 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.740
 also sometimes I'm a little more at 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.630
 both answer their messages more 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.020
 but the friends case is that today they 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.850
 I bring a subject that many say not so 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.950
 it's clones are good not because the clans 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.479
 they are bad so I am going to talk a 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.789
 little about the opinion that I have of 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.369
 the clans something I want to mention 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.680
 is that it is a personal opinion then 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.630
 everyone has the right to think what 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.340
 that you want and there is also the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.020
 comments section so that you 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.659
 also let them know what you 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.819
 they think then first of all I'm going to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890
 start with the pros and then with the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.289
 contras are not in order simply the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.679
 I'm going to say and I'm going to start then 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.750
 with the pros first of all I feel 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.190
 that when you're in a clan you improve 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.050
 this why because when you're in the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.509
 test situation to see if you enter or 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.250
 not like we tend to be very 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.990
 constants in our game good I of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.840
 by itself I have always been inconstant in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 this game but I feel that when 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 I joined 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 the clans in which I have been if 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.679
 better I was more constant and this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.160
 it's precisely because you play with a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.350
 team and you play in an organized way and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.180
 precisely speaking of organization 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.030
 there comes my second advantage in my 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.430
 second but let's say it so it's the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.110
 play organized this is mostly 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.970
 when the tournaments come or when 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.560
 play game barouse I do not know if it has 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 touched that you especially those who 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 have been in plans say you know that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 connect to such an hour because we are going to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 practice not primarily positions on 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 everything also see not because you do arakan 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.580
 you are going to be there of all that then 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.260
 that's a big advantage because I feel 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.850
 that there is more chance of winning when 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 you play organizedly that 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.560
 disorganized you will already tell me 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.270
 what do you think now in the number advantage 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 three is that in 99.9 percent of the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.290
 Sometimes they will win the ranked games 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 when you join that is not a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 clan just sink in like this 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 example let's play domination and it 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.050
 join a large game that they are going to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.150
 win on a lot of occasions 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.780
 because it's rare that they run into a clan 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.610
 that they run into a clan that plays well 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.170
 then it is subtle right for all 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 those who are interested in that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.319
 surely it is going to be sky high and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.329
 is another and another advantage is not another is that 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.359
 You also get to know a lot about 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.280
 people already telling us about the social field 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.099
 You get to meet great people 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.319
 You even become a friend of 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.239
 people especially because always 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.819
 every day every day you play with 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.650
 the same people then is another 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.109
 father thing and precisely for that reason 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.599
 it also comes that there are more possibilities 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.430
 to meet people in life 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.459
 real it touched me when I was in a 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.340
 first clan I left because now I 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.139
 that they stopped connecting but I have 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.579
 good memories with them to one of 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.650
 they got to know him in Mexico 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.319
 I'm talking about who knew him 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.049
 five years or so already in 2008 what 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.329
 I knew in July 2008 and to date 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.090
 I keep having contact with him and it's something 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.920
 very father friends now I will go to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.440
 the disadvantages quickly because it's going 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.150
 finish the video in the first one is that already 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.350
 you do not play anymore with the clan and this 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.170
 precisely because of what you read 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.660
 it sounded not that son's fear of 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.940
 invitation and you say and well it's that I'm 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.430
 practicing apologize but see you 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.440
 later or almost always is with the with 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.820
 the clan and with the clan and with the clan and 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.040
 you miss the opportunity to meet 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.030
 other people is also the first 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.250
 disadvantage now and another one is that of the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.170
 lawsuits precisely and I feel that 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.940
 unfortunately as well as there are things 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.620
 very good within the clans also 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.290
 there are terrible things like the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.000
 loss of friendships and I must tell you that 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.130
 unfortunately it has touched me 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.230
 live that then now yes that as they 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.260
 I say both good things and bad things 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.250
 and I think that of the cons this is the 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.200
 worse because it's amazing as a clan or 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.710
 a rivalry or more than a rivalry 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.870
 simply misunderstandings and silly things 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.420
 can end a friendship that's what 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.460
 second now the number three is that 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.740
 you play depressed and sometimes a stressed 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.260
 this precisely because the fact 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.120
 sometimes want to keep your place in not 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.040
 be banking or sometimes also that 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.590
 there are simply screams 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.510
 and also like that one can with stress 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.070
 that's precisely why it's another great 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.780
 disadvantage because sometimes even by 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.780
 that you do not play in a way 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.430
 adequate and good is also the other 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.230
 which is that you think you're better than 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.930
 others or they do not say anything because I am better 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.730
 that you do not that much because I think that 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.200
 in a mature clan it is not as much as 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.210
 little children not that there is not the 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.030
 I play better than you and everything but good 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.850
 friends, I'm saying goodbye, it 's like 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.250
 I say are my views tell me what 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.720
 you think of the clans and we 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.820
 we see the following video that surely 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.380
 I'm going to upload an emblem I'm going to 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.300
 put to work on this weekend 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.190
 to see if I can record a couple of 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.560
 videos so as not to leave them for so long 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.570
 videos and good friends this we see the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.860
 next and remember to give me a like 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.010
 if you liked this video 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.010
 bye
