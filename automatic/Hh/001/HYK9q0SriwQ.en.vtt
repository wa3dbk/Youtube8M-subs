00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 my name is Luis Estrada 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 it is a single use 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.489
 in this clip 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.529
 I'll show you how to make purchases in html 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.539
 We are working with the same file with some basic labels 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 in order to create behaviors we must first introduce 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.939
 a hunger petke homework this medium 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 p ticket for tables 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.960
 let's specify that the votes in the table 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 they will have pixel points 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 in this way we can see the behaviors better 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.470
 a table is composed of lines that is such a stowaway and with routines that 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.290
 they are vertical 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.920
 when we define a table 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.080
 we have to bring a ticket that represents the table above 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.730
 down 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.920
 we use a label d 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 table row 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.660
 for each commune of the horizontal lines information they need 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 no matter how many corrupt we have 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.780
 inside this ticket we can use the align attribute 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.090
 inside 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.160
 dedicated row of tables 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.490
 we define 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 the secrecy and tas of data from the table 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.000
 we define a table tÃ¡dic tab 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.100
 for each of the behaviors we want in the table 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.380
 as well 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.590
 let's specify 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 that the width of these with others will be 200 pixels 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.560
 now let's say we only want 3 corrupt 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.920
 then we are going to define three of these stavla data labels 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.409
 simply net copy the first 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 labels and hitting twice 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.599
 Let's add some information in each of the labels 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.279
 copy the first row label of tables and paste the twice 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.929
 so that to a total of 3 6 million 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.929
 now we have a table three times three 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.249
 for each one fast 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.239
 rows of tables we can define a different rating 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.899
 now we save the file 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 i refresh the browser 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.329
 that was Luis Estrada energetically demonstrate how to create web pages 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.769
 using for this month
