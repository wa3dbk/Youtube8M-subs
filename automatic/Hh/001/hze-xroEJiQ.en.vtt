00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think the biggest thing we think about

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.959 
think the biggest thing we think about
in<00:01:54.329> writing<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> number<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> big<00:01:56.939> idea

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
in writing is number one have a big idea

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.700 
in writing is number one have a big idea
and<00:01:57.770> big<00:01:58.770> idea<00:01:59.040> doesn't<00:01:59.280> necessarily<00:02:00.030> mean<00:02:00.710> at

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and big idea doesn't necessarily mean at

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
and big idea doesn't necessarily mean at
an<00:02:02.100> asteroids<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> hit<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.939> earth<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
an asteroids going to hit the earth and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
an asteroids going to hit the earth and
you<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> send<00:02:03.899> up<00:02:03.990> oil<00:02:04.229> dwell<00:02:04.860> who's<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you got to send up oil dwell who's to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.809 
you got to send up oil dwell who's to
stop<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:07.530> mean<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> big<00:02:08.280> idea<00:02:08.550> could<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
stop it or I mean a big idea could be a

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.070 
stop it or I mean a big idea could be a
small<00:02:09.060> movie<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.599> The<00:02:09.720> Blair<00:02:09.869> Witch<00:02:09.929> Project

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
small movie like The Blair Witch Project

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.900 
small movie like The Blair Witch Project
which

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
which

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.450 
which
it<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> small<00:02:13.290> tiny<00:02:13.650> budget<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.310> had<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
it was a small tiny budget but it had a

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.700 
it was a small tiny budget but it had a
great<00:02:14.700> idea<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.750> documentary<00:02:16.260> filmmakers

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
great idea some documentary filmmakers

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.380 
great idea some documentary filmmakers
are<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.130> into<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> woods<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.240> see

Hollywood doesn't care about is the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
Hollywood doesn't care about is the
little<00:02:24.390> idea<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.810> how<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.380> grew<00:02:25.560> up<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
little idea of how you grew up in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
little idea of how you grew up in the
suburbs<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.670> dad<00:02:26.820> was<00:02:27.000> made<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.470> now

suburbs and your dad was made to you now

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.690 
suburbs and your dad was made to you now
there's<00:02:28.680> always<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.100> exceptions

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
there's always going to be exceptions

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700 
there's always going to be exceptions
and<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.270> independent<00:02:30.720> worlds<00:02:30.750> full<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.530> those

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and the independent worlds full of those

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.070 
and the independent worlds full of those
but<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.820> Michael<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.450> start<00:02:33.900> with

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
but for Michael and I it was start with

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
but for Michael and I it was start with
a<00:02:34.110> big<00:02:34.320> idea<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.580> our<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.090> our<00:02:36.210> case<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
a big idea like in our in our case the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.470 
a big idea like in our in our case the
courier<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.050> guy<00:02:37.410> who<00:02:37.470> delivers<00:02:38.310> things<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
courier a guy who delivers things to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000 
courier a guy who delivers things to
people<00:02:39.720> who<00:02:39.780> don't<00:02:39.930> want<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.440> reached<00:02:40.710> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
people who don't want to be reached and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.080 
people who don't want to be reached and
then<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.500> write<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> pace<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.730> sense

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
then we just write with a pace a sense

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.740 
then we just write with a pace a sense
of<00:02:45.210> pace<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.200> think<00:02:46.770> Michaels<00:02:47.070> editing

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
of pace that I think Michaels editing

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.980 
of pace that I think Michaels editing
background<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:48.900> helps<00:02:49.730> we<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.450> you

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
background really helps we just want you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.580 
background really helps we just want you
flipping<00:02:52.470> those<00:02:52.590> pages<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.310> that's<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.360> think

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
flipping those pages and that's I think

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.260 
flipping those pages and that's I think
most<00:02:55.590> beginning<00:02:56.190> screenwriters<00:02:56.790> when<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> read

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
most beginning screenwriters when I read

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.480 
most beginning screenwriters when I read
scripts<00:02:57.750> their<00:02:58.380> biggest<00:02:58.650> mistake<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
scripts their biggest mistake is that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.370 
scripts their biggest mistake is that
their<00:02:59.670> scenes<00:02:59.970> begin<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.630> early<00:03:00.960> in<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.230> end

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
their scenes begin to early in the end

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.130 
their scenes begin to early in the end
too<00:03:01.560> late<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.040> they<00:03:02.640> said<00:03:03.480> they<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.750> stretch

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
too late and they said they just stretch

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.540 
too late and they said they just stretch
out<00:03:04.380> things<00:03:04.710> because<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.010> feel<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.280> I've

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
out things because they feel like I've

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.460 
out things because they feel like I've
got<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.970> show<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.300> guy<00:03:06.420> turn<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> light

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
got to show the guy turn on the light

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.870 
got to show the guy turn on the light
switch<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.920> come<00:03:08.100> into<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> room<00:03:08.550> when<00:03:08.760> you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
switch and come into the room when you

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.760 
switch and come into the room when you
don't<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.420> need<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.750> every<00:03:10.560> scene

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
don't you just need to every scene

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.770 
don't you just need to every scene
should<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.280> moving<00:03:11.760> forward<00:03:12.180> that's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
should just be moving forward that's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500 
should just be moving forward that's
what<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.050> try<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.260> do
