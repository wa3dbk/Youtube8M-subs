straight which I put it up as far as the
harp<00:00:31.540> here<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.309> what<00:00:33.430> this<00:00:33.550> does<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:34.000> here<00:00:34.270> we

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.380 
this the two guys is mixing together
mainly<00:00:39.070> nitrogen<00:00:39.519> gas<00:00:39.670> because<00:00:40.179> with

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
mainly nitrogen gas because with

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.479 
mainly nitrogen gas because with
Guinness<00:00:40.629> we<00:00:41.620> need<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.859> creamy<00:00:42.100> out<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.429> the

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
Guinness we need the creamy out of the

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.950 
Guinness we need the creamy out of the
top<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:43.000> gives<00:00:43.269> Guinness<00:00:43.629> it's<00:00:43.780> very

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
top and that gives Guinness it's very

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.630 
top and that gives Guinness it's very
distinctive<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.589> not<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.039> very<00:00:45.339> unique<00:00:45.609> look

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
distinctive and not a very unique look

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.939

okay<00:00:46.539> so<00:00:46.600> after<00:00:46.780> two<00:00:47.079> minutes<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.499> the<00:00:47.589> gas<00:00:47.739> is

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
okay so after two minutes of the gas is

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.919 
okay so after two minutes of the gas is
settling<00:00:48.339> with<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:48.969> nitrogen<00:00:49.329> bubbles<00:00:49.539> going

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
settling with the nitrogen bubbles going

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.869 
settling with the nitrogen bubbles going
down<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.230> side<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.589> glass<00:00:50.730> through<00:00:51.730> the

down the side of the glass through the
middle<00:00:52.149> and<00:00:52.269> then<00:00:52.480> back<00:00:52.690> up<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:52.989> very<00:00:53.170> top

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
enough so that we can then top it up and

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.989 
enough so that we can then top it up and
have<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.440> lovely<00:00:59.769> creamy<00:01:00.280> adds<00:01:00.550> at<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.819> very

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
is a lot darker okay and the head is

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.580 
is a lot darker okay and the head is
increased<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.030> size<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.259> we're<00:01:29.439> going<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
increased in size so what we're going to

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.190 
increased in size so what we're going to
do<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.920> we're<00:01:30.100> going<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.250> slowly<00:01:30.520> talk<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.000> up

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
do is we're going to slowly talk this up

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.109 
do is we're going to slowly talk this up
so<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.920> key<00:01:33.130> at<00:01:33.219> this<00:01:33.340> stage<00:01:33.610> is<00:01:33.789> to<00:01:33.939> make<00:01:34.090> sure

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
so the key at this stage is to make sure

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.029 
so the key at this stage is to make sure
to<00:01:34.299> push<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.630> handle<00:01:35.049> back<00:01:35.200> which<00:01:35.799> is<00:01:35.920> known

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
to push the handle back which is known

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.340 
to push the handle back which is known
as<00:01:36.219> back<00:01:36.399> for<00:01:36.579> black

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
as back for black

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
as back for black
so<00:01:38.010> we're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> slowly<00:01:38.580> push<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> handle

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so we're going to slowly push the handle

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
so we're going to slowly push the handle
back<00:01:39.330> which<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.650> gives<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> far

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
back which you can see it gives a far

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
back which you can see it gives a far
more<00:01:41.130> control<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.470> now<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> fill

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
more control for now I'm going to fill

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
more control for now I'm going to fill
this<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.700> tough<00:01:45.380> okay<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this up to the very very tough okay and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.210 
this up to the very very tough okay and
I'm<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> leave<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
I'm going to leave it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
I'm going to leave it
settle<00:01:47.940> here<00:01:48.410> and<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.620> can<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:49.920> here

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
settle here and you can see here

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.680 
settle here and you can see here
you<00:01:50.400> look<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.550> very<00:01:50.760> closely<00:01:51.030> from

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
you look very very closely from

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.120 
you look very very closely from
underneath<00:01:52.140> it's<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.830> a<00:01:52.860> slightly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
underneath it's actually got a slightly

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.680 
underneath it's actually got a slightly
domed<00:01:53.400> effect<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.300> we<00:01:54.420> call<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
domed effect and this is what we call it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.510 
domed effect and this is what we call it
prior<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> rim<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:55.979> very<00:01:56.070> important

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
prior to the rim so it's very important

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.650 
prior to the rim so it's very important
that<00:01:56.550> when<00:01:56.820> someone<00:01:57.090> asks<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.390> pint<00:01:57.570> of

Guinness that you fill it right up to
the<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.190> top<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.970> no<00:02:00.119> overspill<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.410> if
