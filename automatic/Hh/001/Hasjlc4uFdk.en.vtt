00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.420

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.089

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.380

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.750

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.670
 effort after a few minutes 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.740

 that the tiger adjusts his death on the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.960

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.760
