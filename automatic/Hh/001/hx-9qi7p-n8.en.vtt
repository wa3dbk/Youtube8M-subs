00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.770 
as good but not extremely major problems
here<00:03:18.569> see<00:03:19.569> here<00:03:20.010> okay<00:03:21.010> some<00:03:21.880> bigger<00:03:22.480> frame

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
here see here okay some bigger frame

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.699 
here see here okay some bigger frame
rate<00:03:23.110> drops<00:03:23.769> when<00:03:24.220> I'm<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.549> car

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
rate drops when I'm in a car

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.620 
rate drops when I'm in a car
definitely<00:03:26.709> little<00:03:26.980> figure<00:03:27.340> here<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:31.450> also

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
definitely little figure here and also

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.390 
definitely little figure here and also
me<00:03:31.900> see<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> lot<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.470> other<00:03:32.650> cars<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.250> vehicles

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
me see a lot of other cars and vehicles

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240 
me see a lot of other cars and vehicles
I<00:03:34.180> see<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.349> performance<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.099> not

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
I see that the performance it's not

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.650 
I see that the performance it's not
super<00:03:36.880> good<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:39.519> question<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.000> can<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.269> play

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
super good the question is can you play

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.370 
super good the question is can you play
this<00:03:40.959> games<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:42.810> would<00:03:43.810> say<00:03:44.819> almost<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:47.140> that

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
this games I would say almost not that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.210 
this games I would say almost not that
you<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.650> play<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.980> game

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
you can play this game

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.410 
you can play this game
I<00:03:48.480> mean<00:03:50.370> forcing<00:03:51.370> plays<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> little<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.180> over

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
I mean forcing plays a little bit over

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.729 
I mean forcing plays a little bit over
here<00:03:52.630> drive<00:03:53.620> around<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:55.239> we're<00:03:55.870> not<00:03:56.139> sure<00:03:56.410> if

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
here drive around but we're not sure if

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.539 
here drive around but we're not sure if
you<00:03:57.459> will<00:03:57.670> get<00:03:57.850> used<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.299> flag<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:03.010> of

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
you will get used to the flag or of

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.930 
you will get used to the flag or of
course<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:04.810> will<00:04:05.019> get<00:04:05.200> used<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:06.069> would

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
course you will get used to it but would

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.150 
course you will get used to it but would
be<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.209> nice<00:04:07.870> experience<00:04:08.500> nice<00:04:08.920> game

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
be a nice experience nice game

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.349 
be a nice experience nice game
experience<00:04:10.769> probably<00:04:11.769> not<00:04:12.250> because<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.150> seems

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
experience probably not because it seems

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.940 
experience probably not because it seems
like<00:04:13.480> specially<00:04:13.959> when<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:14.260> are<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.620> car

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
here or when you crash that you really

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.080 
here or when you crash that you really
feel<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.500> frame<00:04:20.500> drops<00:04:20.859> like<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.489> go<00:04:21.669> really

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
feel that frame drops like to go really

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.860 
feel that frame drops like to go really
really<00:04:22.210> low<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.330> course<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.840> a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
really low but then of course is a

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.670 
really low but then of course is a
single<00:04:26.440> core<00:04:26.770> processor<00:04:27.400> inside<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.680> bear

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
single core processor inside so bear

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.730 
single core processor inside so bear
that<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.950> mind<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.700> with<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.530> what

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
that in mind and with that and it what

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.400 
that in mind and with that and it what
do<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.860> think<00:04:33.130> about<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.490> then<00:04:33.729> you<00:04:33.760> notice

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
do you think about that then you notice

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.200 
do you think about that then you notice
this<00:04:35.410> get<00:04:35.770> pretty<00:04:35.979> good<00:04:36.130> performance<00:04:36.639> for<00:04:36.910> a

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
this get pretty good performance for a

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.830 
this get pretty good performance for a
knife<00:04:37.419> come<00:04:37.630> from<00:04:37.840> or<00:04:38.110> for<00:04:38.830> news<00:04:39.190> from<00:04:39.370> 2010

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
knife come from or for news from 2010

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.659 
knife come from or for news from 2010
in<00:04:42.350> this<00:04:42.650> game<00:04:42.950> they<00:04:43.730> come<00:04:43.970> out<00:04:44.000> late<00:04:44.720> 2011<00:04:48.669> but

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
in this game they come out late 2011 but

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.490 
in this game they come out late 2011 but
it<00:04:49.790> will<00:04:49.850> be<00:04:50.000> nice<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.360> for<00:04:50.750> this<00:04:51.200> performance

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
it will be nice it for this performance

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.670 
it will be nice it for this performance
