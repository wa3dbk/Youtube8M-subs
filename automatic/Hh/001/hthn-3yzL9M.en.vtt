In fact, even if the powder for hot, it is soluble in cold milk. I think so!

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.739
Print for the cold, I think marketing purposes.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.140
Maybe, Powder for hot and cold is no different.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.320
Even so, the value does not fall for the cold.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.290
For hot value will rise.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.900

Pan, the meaning of Japanese underwear?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.870
Teraminato-san does not eat soup and Pan(bread) together.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.000
