choke all the way back to the right

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
choke all the way back to the right
which<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.019> be<00:00:49.080> off

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 

so<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.200> see<00:01:01.350> how<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:01.530> machines<00:01:01.920> started

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so you can see how the machines started

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
so you can see how the machines started
to<00:01:02.460> move<00:01:02.580> around<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.120> sometimes<00:01:03.900> it<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
to move around there sometimes it can

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
to move around there sometimes it can
jump<00:01:04.410> into<00:01:04.559> gear<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.370> to<00:01:05.460> give<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
jump into gear so you want to give it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
jump into gear so you want to give it
room<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.420> front<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.840> behind<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.800> that<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
room in front and behind for that to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830 
room in front and behind for that to
happen<00:01:08.160> without<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.000> getting<00:01:09.330> caught<00:01:09.510> under

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
happen without you getting caught under

attachments today we're going to go into

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.969 
attachments today we're going to go into
second<00:01:46.390> gear<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:47.080> move<00:01:47.260> around<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.650> different

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
second gear to move around the different

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.980 
second gear to move around the different
parts<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.369> one<00:01:48.580> field<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.150> we<00:01:49.690> might<00:01:49.840> use

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
parts of one field and we might use

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.960 
parts of one field and we might use
third<00:01:50.229> gear<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.680> go<00:01:50.770> from<00:01:50.979> one<00:01:51.190> field<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.640> the

third gear to go from one field to the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.350 
third gear to go from one field to the
next<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:52.930> do<00:01:53.140> use<00:01:53.470> third<00:01:53.800> gear<00:01:54.360> realize

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
next if you do use third gear realize

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.660 
next if you do use third gear realize
that<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.869> very<00:01:56.140> fast-paced<00:01:56.590> gear<00:01:57.430> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
that it is a very fast-paced gear and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
to use the tie downs is to put them

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.750 
to use the tie downs is to put them
through<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.470> wheels<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.189> the<00:03:53.370> tiller<00:03:53.610> is

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
through the wheels so that the tiller is

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.869 
through the wheels so that the tiller is
secured<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.569> trailer

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.819 

before<00:03:57.659> the<00:03:57.780> start<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.109> each<00:03:58.200> day<00:03:58.260> there's<00:03:58.769> a

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
before the start of each day there's a

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.470 
before the start of each day there's a
few<00:03:59.069> things<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.459> need<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.670> check<00:03:59.969> before<00:04:00.239> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
few things you need to check before you

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.690 
few things you need to check before you
can<00:04:00.689> get<00:04:00.810> going<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.889> first<00:04:02.099> is<00:04:02.370> your<00:04:02.519> engine

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
can get going the first is your engine

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.209 
can get going the first is your engine
oil<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:04.379> you're<00:04:04.499> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> unscrew<00:04:05.010> the

with a clean cloth
I<00:04:09.739> know<00:04:10.739> carefully<00:04:11.159> screw<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.489> back<00:04:11.609> in<00:04:12.379> and

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
I know carefully screw it back in and

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.430 
I know carefully screw it back in and
then<00:04:13.500> screw<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.370> back<00:04:14.489> out<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.169> make<00:04:16.169> sure<00:04:16.289> that

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
then screw it back out to make sure that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.900 
then screw it back out to make sure that
your<00:04:16.560> reading<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.919> accurate<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.430> want<00:04:17.639> your

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
your reading is accurate you want your

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.029 
your reading is accurate you want your
machine<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.479> be<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> level<00:04:19.079> surface<00:04:19.259> so<00:04:19.889> we

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
machine to be on a level surface so we

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.460 
machine to be on a level surface so we
have<00:04:20.190> ours<00:04:20.400> blocked<00:04:20.820> up<00:04:21.030> here<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.320> we're

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
have ours blocked up here so we're

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.930 
have ours blocked up here so we're
checking<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:22.949> if<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.400> level<00:04:23.699> of<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.910> oil

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
checking to see if the level of the oil

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.640 
checking to see if the level of the oil
is<00:04:24.300> about<00:04:24.509> three-quarters<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.320> way<00:04:25.410> up

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
is about three-quarters of the way up

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.279 
is about three-quarters of the way up
the<00:04:25.800> dipstick<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.849> look<00:04:27.000> good<00:04:27.150> if<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.259> was

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
the dipstick and we look good if it was

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.890 
the dipstick and we look good if it was
less<00:04:28.650> than<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.979> you<00:04:29.190> would<00:04:29.340> add<00:04:29.490> more<00:04:29.900> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
less than that you would add more the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.240 
less than that you would add more the
next<00:04:31.139> thing<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.380> want<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.620> check<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.949> your<00:04:32.070> air

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
next thing you want to check is your air

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.490 
next thing you want to check is your air

we'll see the pre-filter and it looks

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.850 
we'll see the pre-filter and it looks
pretty<00:04:45.240> clean<00:04:45.570> but<00:04:45.810> if<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> were<00:04:46.139> dusty<00:04:46.650> we

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
pretty clean but if it were dusty we

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.560 
pretty clean but if it were dusty we
