and<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.359> time<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.139> I'd<00:01:55.499> have<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and this time I think I'd have to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.969 
and this time I think I'd have to
disagree<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.429> gone<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:58.560> afraid

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
disagree with gone I'm afraid

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.679 
disagree with gone I'm afraid
and<00:01:59.249> saying<00:01:59.789> that<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.939> don't<00:01:59.999> think<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:00.359> is<00:02:00.450> like

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and saying that I don't think it is like

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.059 
and saying that I don't think it is like
everything<00:02:00.990> else<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.499> a<00:02:01.530> consequence<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
everything else and as a consequence I

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.169 
everything else and as a consequence I
don't<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.340> he<00:02:02.399> stands<00:02:02.609> any<00:02:02.880> chance

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
don't think he stands any chance

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.719 
don't think he stands any chance
whatsoever<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.749> having<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.139> hit<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.889> he

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
whatsoever of having a hit because he

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.279 
whatsoever of having a hit because he
doesn't<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:05.999> a<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.389> heavy<00:02:06.810> hi-hat
