 colors of the season the green 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 emerald the color of nature in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.769
 one of the kindest to humans 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 but in this tonality does not wake up 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 great passions in the world of fashion 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.769
 spring / summer and little by little sneaks 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.199
 in our cabinets is an ideal color 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.330
 to dress as total looks without adding 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.879

 burberry or nanette lépore the trick 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.750
