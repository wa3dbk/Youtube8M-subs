players<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.539> naturally<00:00:22.080> adopted<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
players have naturally adopted the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.429 
players have naturally adopted the
secondary<00:00:23.279> weapons<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.789> primary<00:00:24.390> weapons<00:00:24.810> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
secondary weapons as primary weapons so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.779 
secondary weapons as primary weapons so
they<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.010> go<00:00:26.130> into<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> match<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
they want them to go into a match and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.950 
they want them to go into a match and
actually<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.660> when

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
actually have to think about when

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.060 
actually have to think about when
they're<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> use<00:00:28.470> their<00:00:28.680> secondary

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
they're going to use their secondary

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.919 
they're going to use their secondary
ammo<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.939> they<00:00:30.090> won't<00:00:30.269> always<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
ammo like they won't always have it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.810 
ammo like they won't always have it
because<00:00:31.470> naturally<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> pretty<00:00:32.399> much<00:00:32.460> always

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because naturally you pretty much always

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.819 
because naturally you pretty much always
do<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.690> while<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.050> playing<00:00:34.230> because

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
do have it while you're playing because

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
do have it while you're playing because
the<00:00:34.980> ammos<00:00:35.250> everywhere<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.300> crate<00:00:36.570> spawn

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the ammos everywhere and the crate spawn

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
the ammos everywhere and the crate spawn
all<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.040> they're<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> limit

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
all the time so they're going to limit

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
all the time so they're going to limit
the<00:00:39.000> amount<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.690> special<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.260> heavy

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the amount that is special and heavy

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
the amount that is special and heavy
ammo<00:00:40.890> crates<00:00:41.190> spawn<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> got<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
ammo crates spawn so you got to kind of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
ammo crates spawn so you got to kind of
think<00:00:42.809> more<00:00:43.079> about<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.649> ammo<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> you're

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
think more about the ammo that you're

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.979 
think more about the ammo that you're
using<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.000> specifically<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.719> they're<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
using so specifically what they're going

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
using so specifically what they're going
to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.170> doing<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.680> special<00:00:47.129> ammo<00:00:47.309> crates

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to be doing to these special ammo crates

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.799 
to be doing to these special ammo crates
it's<00:00:47.850> they're<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:48.420> spawn

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it's they're going to make them spawn

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's they're going to make them spawn
less<00:00:49.079> frequently<00:00:49.620> they're<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> take<00:00:50.399> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
less frequently they're going to take a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.799 
less frequently they're going to take a
longer<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> pick<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.449> there's<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
longer to pick up and there's going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
longer to pick up and there's going to
be<00:00:51.840> less<00:00:52.170> located<00:00:52.649> around<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.039> map<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> when

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
be less located around the map and when

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
be less located around the map and when
you<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.000> pick<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.020> will<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.469> hold

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you do pick them up they will also hold

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.920 
you do pick them up they will also hold
less<00:00:55.949> ammo<00:00:56.399> than<00:00:56.520> before<00:00:56.750> while<00:00:57.750> they're

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
less ammo than before while they're

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.810 
less ammo than before while they're
changing<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.410> crucible<00:00:58.920> flows<00:00:59.190> hopefully

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
changing how crucible flows hopefully

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
changing how crucible flows hopefully
that<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.180> only<00:01:00.300> change<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> better

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that it will only change for the better

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
that it will only change for the better
and<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.620> will<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.190> kill<00:01:02.640> certain

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and they will not actually kill certain

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
and they will not actually kill certain
people's<00:01:03.239> play<00:01:03.480> styles<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.470> there's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
people's play styles because there's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
people's play styles because there's
going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.790> less<00:01:05.850> special<00:01:06.540> ammo

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
going to be so much less special ammo

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to be so much less special ammo
but<00:01:07.560> who<00:01:07.740> knows<00:01:07.950> we'll<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.610> how<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.850> goes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
but who knows we'll see how it goes

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
but who knows we'll see how it goes
maybe<00:01:09.900> it'll<00:01:10.080> add<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.500> more<00:01:10.680> skill<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
maybe it'll add a little more skill to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
maybe it'll add a little more skill to
it<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.580> allow<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> use<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:13.020> more

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it and allow you to use a little more

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
it and allow you to use a little more
strategy<00:01:13.619> while<00:01:13.770> playing<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.310> believe<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
strategy while playing I believe this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
strategy while playing I believe this
will<00:01:14.970> allow<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.360> higher<00:01:15.750> skilled<00:01:16.110> players<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
will allow the higher skilled players to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
will allow the higher skilled players to
be<00:01:16.890> able<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> stand<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> rest<00:01:18.000> even

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
be able to stand out from the rest even

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.090 
be able to stand out from the rest even
more<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.380> guess<00:01:19.590> we'll<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.979> wait

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
more now but I guess we'll have to wait

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.520 
more now but I guess we'll have to wait
and<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.340> until<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.790> patch<00:01:21.000> comes<00:01:21.240> out

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
and see until the patch comes out

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.539 
and see until the patch comes out
another<00:01:22.530> thing<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> they'll<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.070> addressing

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
another thing that they'll be addressing

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
another thing that they'll be addressing
is<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> spawn<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.439> cannot<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is when you spawn and you cannot get to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.940 
is when you spawn and you cannot get to
that<00:01:26.400> ammo<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.330> before<00:01:28.290> someone<00:01:28.680> picks

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that ammo in time before someone picks

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
that ammo in time before someone picks
it<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> I'd<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.540> ammo

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it up and you get in I'd that ammo

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
it up and you get in I'd that ammo
they're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.009> increase<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> drop

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they're going to increase the drop

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
they're going to increase the drop
radius<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> crate<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.040> near

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
radius for a crate so when you are near

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.640 
radius for a crate so when you are near
a<00:01:35.490> crate<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.479> spawn<00:01:36.750> ammo<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> as

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
a crate it will spawn ammo for you as

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.789 
a crate it will spawn ammo for you as
well<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> radius<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.439> higher

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
well so that radius will be a lot higher

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.679 
well so that radius will be a lot higher
this<00:01:41.159> time<00:01:41.220> around<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.000> that'll<00:01:42.570> be

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
this time around and that'll be

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.389 
this time around and that'll be
especially<00:01:43.049> useful<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.310> when

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
especially useful for you for when

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
especially useful for you for when
there's<00:01:44.610> hardly<00:01:44.939> any<00:01:45.240> ammo<00:01:45.630> dropping<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there's hardly any ammo dropping and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.859 
there's hardly any ammo dropping and
it'll<00:01:47.369> prevent<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.939> from<00:01:47.970> missing<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.720> on

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it'll prevent you from missing out on

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
it'll prevent you from missing out on
the<00:01:49.140> ammo<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> does<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.130> draw<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the ammo that does actually draw the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.580 
the ammo that does actually draw the
next<00:01:51.930> thing<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.200> they're<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> be

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
next thing that they're going to be

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
next thing that they're going to be
changing<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.280> heavy<00:01:53.579> ammo<00:01:53.970> spawns<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
changing is how heavy ammo spawns and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
changing is how heavy ammo spawns and
these<00:01:54.899> phones<00:01:55.200> sometimes<00:01:56.100> players<00:01:56.610> will

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
these phones sometimes players will

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
these phones sometimes players will
stand<00:01:57.149> around<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> box<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> spawn<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> heavy

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
stand around the box and spawn the heavy

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.590 
stand around the box and spawn the heavy
ammo<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.430> pick<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> up<00:01:59.969> until<00:02:00.270> later<00:02:00.509> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
ammo but not pick it up until later in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
ammo but not pick it up until later in
the<00:02:00.719> match<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.350> need<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the match when they need it as a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.760 
the match when they need it as a
strategic<00:02:03.119> move<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.509> guess<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.560> want

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
strategic move I guess but they want

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
strategic move I guess but they want
people<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.130> actually<00:02:05.310> pick<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> heavy

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
people to actually pick up the heavy

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
people to actually pick up the heavy
ammo<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.200> spawn<00:02:07.619> rather<00:02:08.280> than

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
ammo when it does spawn rather than

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.669 
ammo when it does spawn rather than
later<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.899> they're<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
later so what they're going to do is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.309 
later so what they're going to do is
make<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> spawn<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.510> rather<00:02:12.930> quick

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
make it the spawn you know rather quick

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
make it the spawn you know rather quick
so<00:02:13.590> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.230 
so you
we<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.430> pick<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.880> when<00:02:15.120> it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
we actually have to pick it up when it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.930 
we actually have to pick it up when it
does<00:02:15.450> come<00:02:15.720> inbound<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.740> use<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.340> while<00:02:17.730> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
does come inbound and use it while you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
does come inbound and use it while you
can<00:02:17.970> another<00:02:18.930> thing<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.440> said<00:02:19.710> they're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
can another thing that they said they're

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.500 
can another thing that they said they're
going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> extend<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.880> inbound<00:02:21.210> timer

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
going to do is extend the inbound timer

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.380 
going to do is extend the inbound timer
by<00:02:21.750> five<00:02:22.020> seconds<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.130> allow<00:02:23.520> more<00:02:23.790> players<00:02:24.120> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
by five seconds so allow more players to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.450 
by five seconds so allow more players to
get<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> ammo<00:02:25.200> we're<00:02:25.650> also<00:02:25.830> adding<00:02:26.160> new

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
get to the ammo we're also adding new

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.820 
get to the ammo we're also adding new
visual<00:02:27.000> prompts<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.690> timers<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.260> pre-spawn

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
visual prompts like timers and pre-spawn

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.580 
visual prompts like timers and pre-spawn
effects<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.910> forecast<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> arrival<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.170> all

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
effects to forecast the arrival of all

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470 
effects to forecast the arrival of all
the<00:02:31.770> ammo<00:02:31.950> crates<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.300> i<00:02:33.330> did

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the ammo crates and that is right i did

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.330 
the ammo crates and that is right i did
say<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.170> ammo<00:02:34.410> crates<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.860> hopefully

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
say all the ammo crates so hopefully

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.160 
say all the ammo crates so hopefully
that<00:02:35.520> means<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:36.000> special<00:02:36.390> ammo<00:02:36.540> crate<00:02:36.840> spawn

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
that means one special ammo crate spawn

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.900 
that means one special ammo crate spawn
as<00:02:37.350> well<00:02:37.560> will<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.040> able<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.400> tell<00:02:38.640> when<00:02:38.820> they

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
as well will be able to tell when they

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.910 
as well will be able to tell when they
do<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.810> could<00:02:39.930> get<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.080> special<00:02:40.440> ammo

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
do so we could get that special ammo

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.980 
do so we could get that special ammo
since<00:02:41.190> it'll<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.490> harder<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> get<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.270> I'm<00:02:42.780> not

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
since it'll be harder to get now I'm not

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.660 
since it'll be harder to get now I'm not
sure<00:02:43.140> exactly<00:02:43.590> how<00:02:43.770> this<00:02:43.920> updates<00:02:44.280> gonna<00:02:44.460> turn

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
sure exactly how this updates gonna turn

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
sure exactly how this updates gonna turn
out<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.360> these<00:02:45.540> changes<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.140> in
