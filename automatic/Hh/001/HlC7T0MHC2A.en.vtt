have figured would have been a cheap
Mario<00:00:24.859> Cart<00:00:25.189> knockoff<00:00:25.789> but<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.500> little

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
just to see what I talked about to see

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.110 
just to see what I talked about to see
how<00:05:11.550> asinine<00:05:12.180> actually<00:05:13.170> is<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:14.250> gathered<00:05:14.910> all

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
how asinine actually is so gathered all

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.400

so<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.590> game<00:05:19.830> was<00:05:19.860> basically<00:05:20.310> designed<00:05:20.550> to

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
so this game was basically designed to

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.780 
so this game was basically designed to
be<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.120> huge<00:05:21.600> replay<00:05:22.050> value<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:23.010> unfortunately

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
be a huge replay value but unfortunately

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.540 
be a huge replay value but unfortunately
I<00:05:23.820> think<00:05:24.000> would<00:05:24.450> fail<00:05:24.810> on<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.110> marker<00:05:25.800> though

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
I think would fail on that marker though

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.190 
I think would fail on that marker though

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.650 
wasn't fun if I was reviewing crap games
I'd<00:06:14.250> be<00:06:14.460> saying<00:06:14.640> right<00:06:14.760> off<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.240> bat<00:06:15.419> right

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
I'd be saying right off the bat right

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.570 
I'd be saying right off the bat right
now<00:06:15.870> that<00:06:16.260> this<00:06:16.380> was<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.590> crap<00:06:16.860> game<00:06:17.100> but<00:06:17.460> it's

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
now that this was a crap game but it's

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.679 
now that this was a crap game but it's
not<00:06:17.690> it<00:06:18.690> would

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
not it would

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.159 
not it would
in<00:06:20.289> my<00:06:20.469> case<00:06:21.069> and<00:06:21.639> many<00:06:22.209> other<00:06:22.360> cases<00:06:22.569> of<00:06:23.019> the

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
in my case and many other cases of the

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.839 
in my case and many other cases of the
owners<00:06:23.649> of<00:06:24.029> the<00:06:25.029> n64<00:06:25.479> Dreamcast<00:06:26.199> versions

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
owners of the n64 Dreamcast versions

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.299 
owners of the n64 Dreamcast versions
probably<00:06:27.849> would<00:06:27.999> go<00:06:28.149> under<00:06:28.449> the<00:06:28.539> case<00:06:28.809> of

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:29.309 
probably would go under the case of

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.109 
probably would go under the case of
average<00:06:30.309> game

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:31.119 
average game

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.869 
average game
now<00:06:31.629> this<00:06:31.869> isn't<00:06:32.049> as<00:06:32.289> good<00:06:32.499> as<00:06:32.679> the<00:06:32.919> n64

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879 
now this isn't as good as the n64

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.909 
now this isn't as good as the n64
version<00:06:34.089> of<00:06:34.509> South<00:06:34.749> Park<00:06:35.049> I<00:06:35.349> love<00:06:35.709> that

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
version of South Park I love that

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.579 
version of South Park I love that
adventure<00:06:36.339> game<00:06:36.489> I<00:06:36.639> have<00:06:37.029> it<00:06:37.299> I<00:06:37.539> have<00:06:38.259> it<00:06:38.319> I

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:38.589 
adventure game I have it I have it I

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:41.249 
adventure game I have it I have it I
bought<00:06:38.949> off<00:06:39.189> eBay<00:06:39.789> and<00:06:40.569> I<00:06:40.689> don't<00:06:40.899> regret<00:06:41.229> it

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
bought off eBay and I don't regret it

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.189 
bought off eBay and I don't regret it
because<00:06:41.499> that<00:06:41.769> was<00:06:41.919> a<00:06:41.979> fun<00:06:42.369> game<00:06:43.199> challenging

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
because that was a fun game challenging

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.239 
because that was a fun game challenging
but<00:06:44.709> fun

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:45.249 
but fun

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:51.389 
but fun
yeah<00:06:45.579> hit<00:06:45.819> a<00:06:45.849> wall<00:06:46.149> it's<00:06:46.839> a<00:06:46.989> wall<00:06:48.179> but<00:06:49.179> yeah<00:06:50.399> and

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.399 
yeah hit a wall it's a wall but yeah and

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.819 
yeah hit a wall it's a wall but yeah and
also<00:06:52.239> the<00:06:52.449> other<00:06:52.749> problem<00:06:53.229> I<00:06:53.319> have<00:06:53.469> this<00:06:53.619> game

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:53.829 
also the other problem I have this game

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:55.829 
also the other problem I have this game
since<00:06:54.099> I<00:06:54.219> can<00:06:54.489> probably<00:06:55.179> have<00:06:55.389> enough<00:06:55.569> time<00:06:55.719> to

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:55.839 
since I can probably have enough time to

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.749 
since I can probably have enough time to
do<00:06:55.989> one<00:06:56.169> more<00:06:56.349> the<00:06:57.039> other<00:06:57.159> problem<00:06:57.489> I<00:06:57.579> have

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 
do one more the other problem I have

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.339 
do one more the other problem I have
with<00:06:57.909> this<00:06:57.999> game<00:06:58.209> is<00:06:58.419> why<00:06:58.959> are<00:06:59.110> there<00:06:59.229> no

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
with this game is why are there no

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.589 
with this game is why are there no
power-ups<00:06:59.949> in<00:07:00.249> the<00:07:00.339> mini<00:07:00.519> arcade<00:07:00.969> so<00:07:01.419> it<00:07:01.509> could

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
power-ups in the mini arcade so it could

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.959 
power-ups in the mini arcade so it could
be<00:07:01.629> like<00:07:01.899> Mario<00:07:02.439> Kart<00:07:02.469> I<00:07:02.829> guess<00:07:03.189> they<00:07:03.369> did<00:07:03.759> add

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:03.969 
be like Mario Kart I guess they did add

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.489 
be like Mario Kart I guess they did add
it<00:07:04.179> because<00:07:04.539> they're<00:07:04.719> a<00:07:04.809> big<00:07:04.989> too<00:07:05.169> much<00:07:05.289> of<00:07:05.409> a

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:05.499 
it because they're a big too much of a

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:07.369 
it because they're a big too much of a
ripoff<00:07:05.860> of<00:07:06.039> the<00:07:06.129> famous<00:07:06.550> Mario<00:07:06.969> Kart<00:07:07.149> series

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
ripoff of the famous Mario Kart series

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:10.499 
ripoff of the famous Mario Kart series
so<00:07:08.379> I<00:07:08.409> guess<00:07:08.709> I<00:07:08.889> would<00:07:08.949> figure<00:07:09.279> well<00:07:10.239> I'm<00:07:10.329> good

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
so I guess I would figure well I'm good

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.299 
so I guess I would figure well I'm good
