and that's what we have to ensure for

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.210 
and that's what we have to ensure for
our<00:02:19.640> migration<00:02:20.320> programs<00:02:21.320> in<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.739> future

our migration programs in the future
that<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.090> look<00:02:23.239> at<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> reasons<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.049> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and make sure that is basically our gold

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.979 
and make sure that is basically our gold
standard<00:02:30.079> for<00:02:30.230> our<00:02:30.620> migration<00:02:31.070> programs

going ahead in the future but I see just

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.240 
going ahead in the future but I see just
continual<00:02:36.350> integration<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.160> the
