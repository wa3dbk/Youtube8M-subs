00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.310
 description under the video to watch 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.619
 what kind of hair masks are used and not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 I want to tell you about my mask from 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 oils with this mask I restored my 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.050
 hair after stormy experiments with 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.880
 staining in 2011 as you know in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 This year I also had experiments with 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 hair dyeing and now i'm 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.079
 I restore hair with this 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 mask this mask must be applied to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 washed hair and hold at least 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.160
 half an hour 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.809
 sometimes i go with her for two hours sometimes i 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 I put oil on the night and wash it off in the morning 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 thanks to castor oil from the roots 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 hair grow strong and healthy i 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.940
 I hope you enjoy my mask for everyone 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.930
 pleasant viewing 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.640
 how do i make a mask of oils so i take 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 I have such a paint thing 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
 I stayed washed her 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.630
 I pour about somewhere can 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 be centimeter maybe less this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.689
 probably a teaspoon of flaxseed oil 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.150
 Lena Lenina and oil is very difficult to wash 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 so I try quite a bit 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.770
 a little further I add approximately 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 about a teaspoon of burdock oil 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.150
 so that all this can be done 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.170
 my roots are burdock oil with red 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.799
 pepper I add about 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.770
 teaspoon of wheat germ oil 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.520
 or jojoba oil for some reason I am very 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 strong base oils like these two love 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 next I add castorca again 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.740
 somewhere 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.840
 probably a teaspoon all to a teaspoon 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.330
 a game that is not a canteen so that not much 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.290
 there was a lot because in the end 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.890
 very much so fat rich 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.300
 oily texture is obtained means 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.110
 this is vitamin e tocopherol acetate and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.570
 retinol acetate is a vitamin and these are 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.990
 I bought vitamins in oils at the pharmacy 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.090
 they cost a penny basically all these 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.950
 oils all these funds are worth a penny 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.600
 the only thing most expensive is this 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.459
 here is wheat germ oil 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.290
 I think 25 hryvnia worth here flaxseed 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.450
 oil can be replaced by olive oil 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.690
 my olive is over a flaxseed 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.260
 as it were, so I use 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.320
 so you can still on the tip of his long 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 hair heat coconut oil or 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.170
 butter what are but i don't have these now 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.290
 long ends so I go around with such 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.140
 oils sometimes I add extra 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.190
 a couple of drops of ether 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.550
 lavender or orange or ylang-ylang 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.370
 Now I have not found him Ylang Ylang I 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.519
 I add more often less orange and even less 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.100
 lavender means when it all poured and 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.720
 just putting it under the tap when 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.430
 open hot water and oil 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.769
 I'm warming up my head and on 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.989
 I put a freshly washed head on this one 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:31.750
 a mask of warm oils, I wear a hat 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.430
 or plastic bag applied 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.640
 very comfortable with this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 I apply the applicator on a parting 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.780
 and in principle, just as I paint 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.890
 hair and I apply it 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.049
 oil mask 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.120
 but all do not forget to go to today 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.420
