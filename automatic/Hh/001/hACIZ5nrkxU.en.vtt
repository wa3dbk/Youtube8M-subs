00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this point maybe a little better at as a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
this point maybe a little better at as a
theme<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.840> even<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> expect<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
theme and even I expect I know what a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.960 
theme and even I expect I know what a
lot<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.040> thought<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.580> worried<00:01:11.790> last

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
lot of people thought we worried last

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
lot of people thought we worried last
year's<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
year's was a get up and down type of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
year's was a get up and down type of
team<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.820> year<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:15.630> years<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
team and this year the two years that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.880 
team and this year the two years that
I've<00:01:15.990> been<00:01:16.020> here<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.590> could<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.860> our

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
I've been here I think this could be our

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520 
I've been here I think this could be our
our<00:01:17.369> most<00:01:17.640> athletic<00:01:18.090> team<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.509> our<00:01:19.140> deepest

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
our most athletic team and our deepest

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
our most athletic team and our deepest
team<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
team so I think a lot of people that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.130 
team so I think a lot of people that
thought<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.299> got<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:21.780> last<00:01:21.990> two

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
thought we got up and down last two

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.210 
thought we got up and down last two
years<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.950> might<00:01:22.979> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
years I think that they might be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
years I think that they might be
surprised<00:01:23.549> i<00:01:23.729> think<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> might<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> little

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
surprised i think it might be a little

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.469 
surprised i think it might be a little
bit<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> year<00:01:26.240> really<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.360> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
bit more that this year really what if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
bit more that this year really what if

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.040 
coach fort system is its we talk about
94<00:03:34.610> feet<00:03:34.760> all<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:34.970> time<00:03:35.060> so<00:03:35.360> it's<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.630> lot<00:03:36.020> of

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
94 feet all the time so it's a lot of

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.479 
94 feet all the time so it's a lot of
people<00:03:36.200> think<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.980> our<00:03:37.130> system<00:03:37.370> our

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
people think that in our system our

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.620 
people think that in our system our
point<00:03:37.700> guards<00:03:37.940> guy<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.209> comes<00:03:38.360> down<00:03:38.510> and

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
point guards guy that comes down and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.780 
point guards guy that comes down and
sets<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.930> up<00:03:39.020> but<00:03:39.230> he's<00:03:39.709> a<00:03:39.739> point<00:03:40.220> guard<00:03:40.340> ready

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
sets it up but he's a point guard ready

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.770 
sets it up but he's a point guard ready
and<00:03:40.940> Fred<00:03:41.120> last<00:03:41.330> year<00:03:41.480> were<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> guys<00:03:41.750> that

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
and Fred last year were the guys that

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.420 
and Fred last year were the guys that
started<00:03:42.230> off<00:03:42.440> on<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.590> defensive<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.130> as<00:03:43.250> well

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
started off on the defensive in as well

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.070 
started off on the defensive in as well
so<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:43.790> picking<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.270> guy<00:03:44.390> up<00:03:44.540> 94<00:03:44.900> feet

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
so it's picking a guy up 94 feet

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.810 
so it's picking a guy up 94 feet
pressure<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.680> ball<00:03:45.800> at<00:03:45.950> all<00:03:46.040> times<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
pressure in the ball at all times so I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.729 
pressure in the ball at all times so I
think<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.810> biggest<00:03:47.930> part<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.470> got<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.620> be

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
think the biggest part is you got to be

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.259 
think the biggest part is you got to be
in<00:03:48.800> shape<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.070> play<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.820> be<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.940> point<00:03:50.120> guard

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
in shape to play to be a point guard

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.570 
in shape to play to be a point guard
under<00:03:50.540> coach<00:03:50.690> forward<00:03:50.959> system<00:03:51.430> are<00:03:52.430> you

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
under coach forward system are you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.640 
under coach forward system are you
comfortable<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.300> think<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.080> mean<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.500> get<00:03:54.560> to

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
comfortable I think so I mean I get to

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.960 
comfortable I think so I mean I get to
practice<00:03:54.920> against<00:03:55.070> Fred<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.459> Ray<00:03:55.580> every<00:03:55.850> day

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
practice against Fred and Ray every day

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.090 
practice against Fred and Ray every day
so<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.420> mean<00:03:56.570> those<00:03:56.930> guys<00:03:57.530> definitely<00:03:57.800> aren't

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
so I mean those guys definitely aren't

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.770 
so I mean those guys definitely aren't
slow<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.670> picking<00:03:59.030> them<00:03:59.209> up<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.360> full<00:03:59.510> course

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
slow so picking them up a full course

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.210 
slow so picking them up a full course
not<00:04:00.200> too<00:04:00.350> easy<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.650> it's<00:04:00.830> giving<00:04:01.010> me<00:04:01.040> some

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
not too easy so it's giving me some

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.720 
not too easy so it's giving me some
pretty<00:04:01.370> good<00:04:01.489> practice<00:04:01.850> in<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:03.640> what<00:04:04.640> are

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
pretty good practice in there what are

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.970 
pretty good practice in there what are
those<00:04:04.820> values<00:04:05.180> been<00:04:05.330> like

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
those values been like

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.940 
those values been like
okay<00:04:06.159> we<00:04:06.790> go<00:04:06.909> not<00:04:07.090> equal<00:04:07.360> feet<00:04:07.599> I<00:04:07.959> mean<00:04:08.560> it's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
okay we go not equal feet I mean it's
