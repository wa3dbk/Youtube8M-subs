guys out there so you basically have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.170 
guys out there so you basically have
four<00:00:32.270> options<00:00:33.100> number<00:00:34.100> one<00:00:34.310> and<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.910> is<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
four options number one and this is the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.840 
four options number one and this is the
most<00:00:35.360> popular<00:00:35.600> out<00:00:35.990> there<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.860> can<00:00:37.130> plug<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
most popular out there you can plug the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.480 
most popular out there you can plug the
exhaust<00:00:38.320> that's<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:39.650> I<00:00:39.680> do<00:00:39.800> if<00:00:40.130> I'm<00:00:40.250> going<00:00:40.430> to

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
exhaust that's what I do if I'm going to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.510 
exhaust that's what I do if I'm going to
be<00:00:40.580> running<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.330> again<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:42.770> litter<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.490> the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
be running it again the litter in the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.630 
be running it again the litter in the
day<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.990> only<00:00:45.080> problem<00:00:45.410> with<00:00:45.470> that<00:00:45.640> was

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
day the only problem with that was

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.220 
day the only problem with that was
actually<00:00:46.940> two<00:00:47.060> problems<00:00:47.420> with<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.660> number

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
actually two problems with that number

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.320 
actually two problems with that number
one<00:00:48.530> these<00:00:49.010> aluminum<00:00:49.430> pipes<00:00:49.640> get<00:00:49.850> really

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
one these aluminum pipes get really

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.940 
one these aluminum pipes get really
really<00:00:50.630> really<00:00:51.020> hot<00:00:51.290> especially<00:00:51.620> with<00:00:51.860> the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
really really hot especially with the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.460 
really really hot especially with the
big<00:00:52.070> block<00:00:52.130> engines<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.510> there's<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.380> you

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
big block engines so there's what you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.430 
big block engines so there's what you
can<00:00:54.620> do<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.830> have<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.070> solve<00:00:55.370> that<00:00:55.930> as<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.260> can

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
can do to have to solve that as you can

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.440 
can do to have to solve that as you can
by<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:57.680> tubing<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:58.970> was<00:00:59.090> actually<00:00:59.210> came

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
by this tubing this was actually came

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.900 
by this tubing this was actually came
off<00:00:59.480> my<00:00:59.720> chair<00:00:59.930> accesskey<00:01:00.320> max<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:00.950> just

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
off my chair accesskey max and you just

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.240 
off my chair accesskey max and you just
slide<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.360> right<00:01:02.570> over<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.930> stinger<00:01:03.320> i'm

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
slide that right over the stinger i'm

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.840 
slide that right over the stinger i'm
your<00:01:04.489> exhaust<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.500> just<00:01:06.500> see<00:01:07.219> have<00:01:07.340> like<00:01:07.520> two

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
your exhaust and just see have like two

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.590 
your exhaust and just see have like two
millimeters<00:01:08.359> of<00:01:08.509> piping<00:01:08.920> sticking<00:01:09.920> out<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
millimeters of piping sticking out and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.179 
millimeters of piping sticking out and
then<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.899> just<00:01:11.929> you're<00:01:12.560> right<00:01:12.799> on<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.009> rubber

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
then you just you're right on the rubber

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.190 
then you just you're right on the rubber
so<00:01:13.789> it<00:01:13.969> doesn't<00:01:14.240> do<00:01:14.299> anything<00:01:14.539> and<00:01:14.749> you're

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
so it doesn't do anything and you're

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.569 
so it doesn't do anything and you're
good<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:15.469> you<00:01:15.590> don't<00:01:15.890> bring<00:01:16.039> yourself

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
good to go you don't bring yourself

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.940 
good to go you don't bring yourself
so<00:01:16.939> that's<00:01:17.509> that's<00:01:18.049> what<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.200> do<00:01:18.289> when<00:01:18.619> I'm<00:01:18.770> done

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
so that's that's what I do when I'm done

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.870 
so that's that's what I do when I'm done
and<00:01:19.189> that's<00:01:19.579> that's<00:01:19.819> always<00:01:20.060> nice<00:01:20.299> and

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
and that's that's always nice and

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.800 
and that's that's always nice and
there's<00:01:22.880> only<00:01:23.090> one<00:01:23.329> other<00:01:23.450> problem<00:01:23.689> with<00:01:23.780> that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
there's only one other problem with that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.249 
there's only one other problem with that
is<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.549> if<00:01:25.549> you're<00:01:25.850> done<00:01:26.030> for<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.270> day<00:01:26.329> don't

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
is if if you're done for the day don't

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.649 
is if if you're done for the day don't
plug<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.679> exhaust<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.219> let<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.520> sit<00:01:28.819> number

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
plug your exhaust and let it sit number

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.419 
plug your exhaust and let it sit number
one<00:01:29.899> you're<00:01:30.229> not<00:01:30.409> few<00:01:30.679> left<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:30.979> your<00:01:31.069> engine

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
one you're not few left in your engine

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.830 
one you're not few left in your engine
and<00:01:31.579> it's<00:01:31.729> going<00:01:31.819> to<00:01:31.880> corrode<00:01:32.210> your<00:01:32.240> motor<00:01:32.600> and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and it's going to corrode your motor and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.129 
and it's going to corrode your motor and
number<00:01:33.679> two<00:01:34.549> now<00:01:35.090> what<00:01:35.569> that's<00:01:35.659> going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.899> do

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.139 
number two now what that's going to do

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.870 
number two now what that's going to do
is<00:01:36.439> that<00:01:36.649> is<00:01:36.889> going<00:01:37.280> you'll<00:01:38.030> have<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:39.880> also

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
is that is going you'll have to also

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.399 
is that is going you'll have to also
when<00:01:41.299> you're<00:01:41.420> doing<00:01:41.600> after<00:01:41.899> procedure<00:01:42.109> it's

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
when you're doing after procedure it's

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.929 
when you're doing after procedure it's
going<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.619> kind<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.859> throw<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.189> all<00:01:43.310> off<00:01:43.549> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
going to kind of throw it all off and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.080 
going to kind of throw it all off and
it's<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:44.749> overall<00:01:45.319> not<00:01:45.350> good<00:01:46.130> at<00:01:46.249> unison<00:01:46.880> if

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's just overall not good at unison if

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.809 
it's just overall not good at unison if
you're<00:01:47.329> done<00:01:47.509> for<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.689> day<00:01:47.749> so<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.340> second

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
you're done for the day so the second

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.699 
you're done for the day so the second
option<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.659> is<00:01:50.869> good<00:01:51.109> if<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:51.380> don't<00:01:51.469> for<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
option this is good if you don't for the

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.949 
option this is good if you don't for the
day<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.159> what<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.549> like<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.359> said<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:53.840> I'm

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
day this is what I do like I said if I'm

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that's actually not very good for the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.620 
that's actually not very good for the
combustion<00:02:44.830> process<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:46.000> not<00:02:46.330> recommend
