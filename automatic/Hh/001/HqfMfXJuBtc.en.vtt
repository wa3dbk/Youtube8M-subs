00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Chester there's no excuse for what we

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
Chester there's no excuse for what we
saw<00:01:18.330> Saturday<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.259> terms<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.770> they

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
saw Saturday in terms of the way they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
saw Saturday in terms of the way they
handle<00:01:20.250> Morgan<00:01:20.580> Newton<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> fact<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
handle Morgan Newton and the fact that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
handle Morgan Newton and the fact that
they<00:01:21.630> quit<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> second<00:01:22.560> half<00:01:22.790> well<00:01:23.790> I

they quit in the second half well I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.429 
they quit in the second half well I
think<00:01:24.030> they're<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.990> trying<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> make

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
think they're I'm not trying to make

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
think they're I'm not trying to make
excuses<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.100> nobody<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.850> was<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> bad<00:01:27.299> game<00:01:27.600> but

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
excuses for nobody it was a bad game but

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
excuses for nobody it was a bad game but
I<00:01:28.020> mean<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.500> goodness<00:01:28.680> sakes<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.549> there's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I mean for goodness sakes a lot there's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.210 
I mean for goodness sakes a lot there's
eight<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.479> games<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> schedule<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
eight more games on the schedule and I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
eight more games on the schedule and I
believe<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.820> win<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.990> don't

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
believe that we can win I think I don't

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.480 
believe that we can win I think I don't
think<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> question<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.310> they

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
think it's out of the question if they

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
think it's out of the question if they
get<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> pieces<00:01:36.360> working<00:01:36.689> together<00:01:36.900> if

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
get all the pieces working together if

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
get all the pieces working together if
we<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.799> together<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.790> could

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
we get it all together that they could

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.499 
we get it all together that they could
possibly<00:01:39.150> win<00:01:39.600> five<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.530> mean<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:42.030> think

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
possibly win five of them I mean I think

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
possibly win five of them I mean I think
it's<00:01:42.960> possible<00:01:43.530> Matt<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.280> win<00:01:44.460> five<00:01:44.759> if

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it's possible Matt if they win five if

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's possible Matt if they win five if
they<00:01:45.509> went<00:01:45.659> five<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.259> Joker<00:01:46.649> probably<00:01:47.040> job

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
they went five then Joker probably job

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.510 
they went five then Joker probably job
is<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> exactly<00:01:49.829> right<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is back that is exactly right and so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
is back that is exactly right and so
it's<00:01:50.729> not<00:01:50.909> fair<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.509> him<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.200> fair<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's not fair to him it's not fair to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's not fair to him it's not fair to
anyone<00:01:52.799> else<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.759> calling<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> and

anyone else be out there calling in and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
anyone else be out there calling in and
getting<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.409> him<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.340> need<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> give

to<00:04:02.510> turn<00:04:02.720> on<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.049> win<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.799> then<00:04:03.920> all

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
to turn on and win that one and then all

their<00:04:06.230> face<00:04:06.440> what<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.519> should<00:04:07.640> happen<00:04:07.700> is

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
their face what I think should happen is

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.300 
their face what I think should happen is
if<00:04:08.239> he<00:04:08.360> does<00:04:08.600> turn<00:04:08.840> around<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.350> we<00:04:09.410> win<00:04:09.620> it
