little bit longer and we don't need a
product<00:02:14.890> box<00:02:15.280> because<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.940> our<00:02:16.090> vlog<00:02:16.420> and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
product box because it's our vlog and

another<00:02:19.959> cool<00:02:20.290> thing<00:02:20.319> about<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.920> software

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
another cool thing about this software

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.090 
another cool thing about this software
is<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.880> de<00:02:22.060> text<00:02:22.480> can<00:02:22.690> go<00:02:22.810> right<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.380> top<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:24.010> an

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
is the de text can go right on top of an

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.760 
is the de text can go right on top of an
animation<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.910> we'll<00:02:25.690> add<00:02:25.870> an<00:02:26.020> outline<00:02:26.530> and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
animation and we'll add an outline and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.490 
animation and we'll add an outline and
the<00:02:27.640> text<00:02:28.060> probably<00:02:28.780> should<00:02:29.020> be<00:02:29.170> yellow

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the text probably should be yellow

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.190 
the text probably should be yellow
instead<00:02:31.350> there<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.440> go<00:02:33.030> boom<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.450> we'll<00:02:34.780> put

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
instead there we go boom and we'll put
