just like that and that's how it's going

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.140 
just like that and that's how it's going
to<00:02:44.230> work<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.190> said<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:45.519> bait<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.880> good<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to work like I said as bait is good and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.970 
to work like I said as bait is good and
soft<00:02:46.450> but<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:46.870> still<00:02:47.079> very<00:02:47.319> tough<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.920> very

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
soft but it's still very tough and very

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.849 
soft but it's still very tough and very
very<00:02:48.730> pliable<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.200> will<00:02:50.380> catch<00:02:50.620> more

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
very pliable and you will catch more

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.220 
very pliable and you will catch more
than<00:02:51.040> one<00:02:51.160> fish<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:52.389> other<00:02:52.540> way<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.989> rig

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
than one fish on it the other way we rig

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.069 
than one fish on it the other way we rig
them<00:02:53.410> like<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.889> says<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.340> jig<00:02:54.670> head<00:02:55.079> the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
them like it says on the jig head the

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.690 
them like it says on the jig head the
Little<00:02:56.350> John<00:02:56.560> was<00:02:56.709> especially<00:02:57.010> designed<00:02:57.370> for

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
Little John was especially designed for

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.150 
Little John was especially designed for
this<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.690> got<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> flat<00:02:59.260> end<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.709> like<00:02:59.950> that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
this it's got a flat end on it like that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800 
this it's got a flat end on it like that
and<00:03:00.459> then<00:03:00.609> it's<00:03:00.760> tapered<00:03:01.120> down<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.480> point

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
and then it's tapered down to a point

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.410 
and then it's tapered down to a point
all<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.799> do<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:02.980> drive<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.760> jig<00:03:04.090> head<00:03:04.269> right

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
all you do is drive the jig head right

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
all you do is drive the jig head right
into<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> middle<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.109> slide<00:03:05.799> it<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.040> and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
into the middle of it slide it up and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.520 
into the middle of it slide it up and
around<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.450> push<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.750> right<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.019> on<00:03:08.170> your<00:03:08.290> jig

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
around and push it right up on your jig

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.460 
around and push it right up on your jig
head<00:03:09.420> when<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.480> push<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.840> up<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.139> gives<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.349> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
head when you push it up it gives it a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.740 
head when you push it up it gives it a
nice<00:03:11.620> profile<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.549> fits<00:03:12.910> snugly<00:03:13.419> up<00:03:13.510> against

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
nice profile and fits snugly up against

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.240 
nice profile and fits snugly up against
the<00:03:13.870> jig<00:03:14.079> head<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:14.380> there's<00:03:14.560> no<00:03:14.680> gaps<00:03:14.919> and<00:03:15.190> it

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
the jig head so there's no gaps and it

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.670 
the jig head so there's no gaps and it
travels<00:03:15.609> through<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.819> water<00:03:16.030> very<00:03:16.540> nicely

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.170 

now<00:03:20.680> we've<00:03:20.919> got<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.190> baits<00:03:21.370> rig<00:03:21.639> now<00:03:21.940> comes
