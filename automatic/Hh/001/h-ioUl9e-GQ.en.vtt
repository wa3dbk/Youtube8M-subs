00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
 the color change within a row 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.799
 is a bit tricky but not synonymous 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.320
 witchcraft we would like to see here in the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.980
 middle so a little differently colored 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.809
 square daily and that's what we want 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 one side each three violet 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.850
 mesh and in the middle four orange 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.970
 I have a total of ten here 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 meshes of both treads is firm mesh 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.430
 to be observed 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.450
 We pick up the work phases 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 held out two loops on the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.630
 needle 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.750
 but we already do the crochet 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.780
 with the new color that means we 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.940
 simply switch to the orange to the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.539
 another color and pick the one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.969
 work phases with orange by now four 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.449
 strong stitches in orange and around 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.609
 we simply crochet the purple thread 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 by laying him behind the mesh 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.640
 and every time we take one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.650
 sting 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.540
 That's why we do not need to knot threads 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.659
 but then you can just go with it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 continue crochet violet but we crochet 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 we want to crochet four orange stitches 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 but only three and at the fourth now 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 we also do not take the violet 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.729
 thread more with crochet with us to the end 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 the purple thread 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.790
 So that is always a stitch in front of the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 actual color change we crochet the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.070
 already finish with the new color 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.040
 and here are three solid stitches in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.950
 purple and that's how we do it 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.280
 the flashback air mass a solid 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.320
 machine second and at the third the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.860
 we do not crochet so only two 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 proposals on the nato to orange like 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.530
 Do not forget to change the forget 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 I like the violet now 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.160
 So hedges to crochet easily when 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 take a pierce 12 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 three fixed machines orange and at the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.630
 fourth again change color so 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.630
 only two strokes on nato and that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.740
 Pulling the thread with the other 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.030
 with the other color and again 123 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.600
 strong stitches 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.489
 So not difficult at all 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.590
 but it looks very clean there are 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.440
 of course no strings because we the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.130
 different colored damage with crochet turn 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 Air mass again a solid mesh one 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.830
 second solid mass and the treads not 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.810
 finished crocheting so only the working thread 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.470
 By picking up doubles on the nose and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.010
 now with the new color on 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.300
 crochet and do not forget the other one 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.709
 take color with you 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:09.600
 One can not put on a little bit too 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.579
 firm 23 fixed mesh and at the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 fourth again not the fourth again 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.480
 Crochet over 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.750
 with violet the working phases through the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.750
 pull two loops 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.590
 and again three solid meshes violet 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.630
 our little square in it is 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.580
 ready and now really easy 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.630
 just as many string together 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.410
 namely three only in purple so easy 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.410
 about it 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:00.750
 By the way, you can do a great job in that way 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.680
 radicals can process and from a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.920
 pillowcase or for example a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.590
 crochet bag when you corner them 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 is together so is he has shown so 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.769
 a small square with one 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.769
 different colored square inside
