00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
actually do is prevent you from going
through<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> character<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> other

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
through the character on to the other

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.210 
through the character on to the other
side<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.560> once<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.740> practicing<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
side and once you're practicing this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
side and once you're practicing this
combo<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> guys<00:01:47.820> try<00:01:48.299> running<00:01:48.720> step<00:01:48.899> call<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
combo you guys try running step call I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.069 
combo you guys try running step call I
run<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.700> um<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.180> work<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
run to it a lot but um just work on it

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.260 
run to it a lot but um just work on it
and<00:01:52.259> eventually<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> timing

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and eventually you get that timing

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.230 
and eventually you get that timing
perfectly<00:01:54.960> down<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> should

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
perfectly down so this is what it should

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.130 
perfectly down so this is what it should
look<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:59.299> next<00:02:00.299> step<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:01.020> gonna

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
look like and then next step we're gonna

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.800 
look like and then next step we're gonna
add<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:02.159> course<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.759> small<00:02:02.969> pause<00:02:03.270> triangle

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
add of course the small pause triangle

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
add of course the small pause triangle
square<00:02:04.020> circle<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.710> also<00:02:05.040> another<00:02:05.280> thing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
square circle that's also another thing

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
square circle that's also another thing
that's<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.390> sub-zero<00:02:06.570> combos<00:02:07.200> so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
that's in a lot of sub-zero combos so

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.369 
that's in a lot of sub-zero combos so
yeah<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.520> small<00:02:08.789> pause<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.750> important

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
yeah that small pause is important

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.380 
yeah that small pause is important
because<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> don't<00:02:11.069> pause

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
because if you don't pause

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.320 
because if you don't pause
kamo<00:02:13.020> doesn't<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.850> respond<00:02:14.850> through

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
kamo doesn't actually respond through

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
kamo doesn't actually respond through
and<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:16.110> doesn't<00:02:16.440> happen<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> actual

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
and it doesn't happen on the actual

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.860 
and it doesn't happen on the actual
screen<00:02:17.790> even<00:02:18.090> though<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.300> input<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.720> on<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
screen even though you input it on the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.559 
screen even though you input it on the
controller<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.520> pause<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.090> very

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
controller so that pause is very

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.420 
controller so that pause is very
important<00:02:22.110> all<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> timing<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.250> very

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
important all the timing this is very

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.460 
important all the timing this is very
important<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.540> apologize<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.140> next

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
important and I apologize for next

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.840 
important and I apologize for next
playing<00:02:25.620> before<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.130> you'll<00:02:26.250> see<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.580> while

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
playing before but you'll see that while

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.920 
playing before but you'll see that while
in<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> controller<00:02:27.510> view<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.840> actually<00:02:28.170> do

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
in the controller view I actually do

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.570 
in the controller view I actually do
forward<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.110> anyways<00:02:31.320> let's<00:02:32.190> do<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> back

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
forward but anyways let's do the back

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.280 
forward but anyways let's do the back
photo<00:02:32.820> plus<00:02:33.150> r2<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.810> hand<00:02:34.020> slide

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
photo plus r2 it's just in hand slide

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.930 
photo plus r2 it's just in hand slide
you<00:02:34.560> don't<00:02:34.740> need<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.920> art<00:02:35.070> tool<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.820> make

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
you don't need the art tool just to make

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.370 
you don't need the art tool just to make
it<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.120> damaged<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.900> back<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.320> was

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it more damaged but back to what I was

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.260 
it more damaged but back to what I was
saying<00:02:37.590> when<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.459> see<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> controller<00:02:39.030> view<00:02:39.209> I

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
saying when you see a controller view I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.060 
saying when you see a controller view I
actually<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.810> forward<00:02:40.440> before<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.739> do<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> up

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
actually do forward before I do the up

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.100 
actually do forward before I do the up
triangle<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.970> don't<00:02:42.209> exactly<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.080> I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
triangle you don't exactly have to but I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.690 
triangle you don't exactly have to but I
personally<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.040> closer<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
personally like you to get closer to the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.430 
personally like you to get closer to the
character<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> make<00:02:45.390> sure<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> combo<00:02:46.230> gets

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
character to make sure the combo gets

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.990 
character to make sure the combo gets
through<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.950> actually<00:02:47.070> hits<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> character

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
through and actually hits the character

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.990 
through and actually hits the character
but<00:02:48.989> that's<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.709> explain<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.430> forward

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but that's just to explain the forward

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.310 
but that's just to explain the forward
if<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.209> guys<00:02:51.360> were<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.570> bit<00:02:51.750> confused<00:02:52.170> with

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
if you guys were a bit confused with

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.060 
if you guys were a bit confused with
that<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> whole<00:02:55.650> hope

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
that and so there it is as a whole hope

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070 
that and so there it is as a whole hope
you<00:02:56.220> guys<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.820> it's<00:02:57.000> pretty<00:02:57.239> solid<00:02:57.480> combo

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
you guys like it it's pretty solid combo

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320 
you guys like it it's pretty solid combo
and<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.640> said<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.940> beginning<00:03:00.000> of
