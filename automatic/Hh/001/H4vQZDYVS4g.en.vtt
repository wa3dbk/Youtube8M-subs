00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.630
 I want to share my experience 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.330
 I consider it quite positive 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:18.570
 so I think everything is good 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.500
 it's worth showing and I put it as 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.130
 suggestion to anyone who has an interest in 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 use the same idea 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:37.680
 this is the new ford ranger with the gnv kit 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.140
 of fifth generation installed for whom 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 you are interested in buying this vehicle from 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.050
 new form of good angel is already known that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 she drinks hell you tend to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 spend the face eye with fuel 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.739
 because on the highway 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:02.280
 it does on average 7.5 kilometers per 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.470
 liter rather 7,5 kilometers per liter 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.619
 with gasoline in the alcohol she will do 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.350
 five kilometers politics 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 I did the test I took the average really is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 that's right 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 She drinks a lot and it's a car. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 Beautiful is a sports truck. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.509
 I personally like her so I did 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.049
 had the fifth- generation gnv kit installed 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:34.020
 generation and result she makes in gnv 12 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.060
 kilometers per cubic meter 12 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 kilometers per cubic meter 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.820
 I took the test I did the average 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.369
 this result 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.100
 So you can travel for example. 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:52.020
 250 kilometers with this truck 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 spending a maximum of 40 reais 250km 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 you will spend a maximum of 40 reais 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 This is very good detail how do I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.299
 I put this two-cylinder truck 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 gas of 25 cubic meters each 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.740
 then it carries 50 cubic meters of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:23.210
 which gives an autonomy of 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:23.210
 more or less 600 kilometers to 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.170
 so I'm showing you both here 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.849
 cylinders 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:01.420
 the cylinder takes the width of the bucket 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.340
 you can put one against the other 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.799
 you take two cylinders quietly 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.579
 room left over for loading because the 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:14.230
 song is too big so there are 50 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.329
 cubic meters will give you a 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.709
 autonomy of 1 600 km plus or 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.480
 less and a motor route redondinho 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.099
 if you do not even feel the gasoline change 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.519
 progress does not make noise is soft is 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.699
 without feeling the change of 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.699
 fuel 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.780
 so it's there 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.560
 sharing my experience here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 the idea is good install the gnv kit of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.930
 fifth generation in its new ford ranger and 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.930
 I assure you that you will not regret it
