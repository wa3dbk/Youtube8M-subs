00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.059
 first option 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.469
 pistol shooting with two hands 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.250
 free hand 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.610
 supports shooting hand from below 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.610
 just below 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.790
 second option when free hand 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.690
 support shooting hand not only 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:46.750
 bottom but also in front of the trigger guard 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.750
 while dramatically reduced containment 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.090
 the gun is worth enough 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.090
 steadily and pull off i'm not happening 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.300
 for greater efficiency thumb 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.360
 hand shoots tight 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.050
 pistol perpendicular to the plane 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.490
 the grip presses against it 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.040
 thumb supporting hand such 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.610
 reception practically reduces deterrence to 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 zero hold the gun grip 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.680
 wrists cannot be 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.680
 suitable with great strength and back after 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:57.400
 shutter shot broke no longer one 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:01.090
 finger shooting at long range with 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.729
 knee supporting arm forms one 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.190
 vertical line with shin 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.900
 so that the gun shooter system 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.900
 swam from side to side 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.250
 gun can be supported as below 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.250
 and for the bracket who is more comfortable 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.260
 so shoots a pistol when necessary 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.560
 take a low level but prevents 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 shrubs tall grass shooting system 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.170
 on rifle in supporting hand 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:46.440
 pressed his elbow to the edges of the side is good 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.440
 it is seen 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.590
 to balance the body slightly tilt 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:07.760
 not lean back 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:10.340
 bullets and pulled down with this method 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.040
 You can shoot a gun on 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 maximum pistol light distance 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.420
 up to 200 meters 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.100
 when shooting rock at the shooter usually 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.740
 sits right buttock or coccyx on 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.050
 right heel 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.780
 shooting hand supported free 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.390
 hand bottom or front of the trigger 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.340
 bracket 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.240
 the hull is set straight to collapse 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:49.810
 forward right left cannot be to avoid 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:54.300
 bullet care in these sides you see 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.300
 correct landing when shooting from the knee 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.290
 can shoot with two hands actual 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.890
 triangles holds the gun on 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.890
 outstretched arms 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.020
 German elbow shooting left 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.300
 supporting hand 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.080
 necessarily closes the wrist behind 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.460
 elbow right for system stiffness 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.260
 look carefully this way by 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.270
 circumstances of events can 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.270
 use and when shooting from the knee 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.080
 the gun is worth enough 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 steadily 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.480
 in no case can not be put 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:14.530
 gun directly to the elbow otherwise 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.389
 elbow can be easily shot through 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.630
 recoil of the gun when it moves 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.940
 after firing back gun 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.040
 supported forehead than just under 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.660
 wrists 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:31.300
 This method is convenient for shooting at 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:33.880
 distant running targets so happens 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.340
 for vodka enslaved system shooter 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.340
 the weapon is in line with the movement of the target
