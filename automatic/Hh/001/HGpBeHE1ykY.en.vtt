00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
implant treatment has really been a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.529 
implant treatment has really been a
great<00:00:26.010> technology<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.000> patients<00:00:27.390> whose

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
great technology for patients whose

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.730 
great technology for patients whose
teeth<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.960> reached<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> point<00:00:28.439> where<00:00:28.560> they

decayed or are just so broken down that
we<00:00:35.280> can't<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.940> anymore<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we can't use them anymore in the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
we can't use them anymore in the
reconstruction<00:00:37.469> process<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.640> those<00:00:39.059> patients

who<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.870> reached<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> point<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:41.160> recommend

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
who have reached that point we recommend

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
who have reached that point we recommend
removal<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> team<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> reconstruction

including decay and tooth loss she had

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
including decay and tooth loss she had
reached<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> point<00:00:51.780> where<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.230> did<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.770> feel

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
reached a point where we did not feel

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.560

light on education what they liked about

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.080 
light on education what they liked about
my<00:01:40.380> approach<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> simply<00:01:41.670> gave<00:01:41.700> them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
my approach was that I simply gave them

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
my approach was that I simply gave them
their<00:01:42.180> options<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.290> able<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.619> show<00:01:43.799> them

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
their options and was able to show them

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
their options and was able to show them
similar<00:01:44.490> cases<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.630> could<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:45.930> their

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
similar cases so they could make their

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170 
similar cases so they could make their
own<00:01:46.170> decision<00:01:46.770> dr.<00:01:47.340> McFadden<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.000> easy

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
own decision dr. McFadden is very easy

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.929 
own decision dr. McFadden is very easy
to<00:01:48.360> talk<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.899> he<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> joke<00:01:49.860> he's<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.909> a
