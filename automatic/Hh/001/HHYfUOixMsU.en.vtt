00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
soiled it's a you know they have them we

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.350 
soiled it's a you know they have them we
have<00:00:56.680> down<00:00:57.070> jackets<00:00:57.610> we<00:00:57.759> stole<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.089> from

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
have down jackets we stole that from

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.729 
have down jackets we stole that from
nature's<00:00:58.750> because<00:00:58.989> they<00:00:59.110> basically<00:00:59.259> have<00:00:59.650> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
nature's because they basically have the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.109 
nature's because they basically have the
perfect<00:01:00.100> down<00:01:00.250> jackets<00:01:00.759> and<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:00.970> their

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
perfect down jackets and so their

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.179 
perfect down jackets and so their
feathers<00:01:01.449> all<00:01:01.659> interlock<00:01:02.530> over<00:01:02.830> their<00:01:02.979> body

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
feathers all interlock over their body

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:04.979 
feathers all interlock over their body
and<00:01:03.460> there's<00:01:03.729> a<00:01:03.790> barrier<00:01:04.180> there's<00:01:04.420> their<00:01:04.600> skin

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
and there's a barrier there's their skin

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.569 
and there's a barrier there's their skin
there's<00:01:05.409> down<00:01:05.650> feathers<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.280> then<00:01:06.369> there<00:01:06.490> are

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
there's down feathers and then there are

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.550 
there's down feathers and then there are
serial<00:01:06.880> fathers<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.360> between<00:01:07.810> there<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.259> warm

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
serial fathers and between there is warm

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.590 
serial fathers and between there is warm
air<00:01:08.770> that's<00:01:09.250> that's<00:01:09.640> just<00:01:10.090> pumped<00:01:10.360> out<00:01:10.450> from

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
air that's that's just pumped out from

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.420 
air that's that's just pumped out from
their<00:01:10.780> body<00:01:10.990> heat<00:01:11.229> what<00:01:11.860> happens<00:01:12.189> when<00:01:12.310> they

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
their body heat what happens when they

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.370 
their body heat what happens when they
get<00:01:12.549> oil<00:01:12.759> on<00:01:12.970> them<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.540> that<00:01:13.930> that

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
get oil on them is that that that

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.440 
get oil on them is that that that
protective<00:01:14.860> barrier<00:01:15.189> because<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.820> becomes

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
protective barrier because it becomes

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630 
protective barrier because it becomes
impaired<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.290> all<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.100> feathers<00:01:18.399> stick

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
impaired and all the feathers stick

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.219 
impaired and all the feathers stick
together<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.329> and<00:01:19.540> they<00:01:19.930> immediately

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
together and that and they immediately

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.649 
together and that and they immediately
get<00:01:20.560> wet<00:01:20.890> by<00:01:21.100> with<00:01:21.399> water<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:22.210> if<00:01:22.329> you're<00:01:22.479> out

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
get wet by with water so if you're out

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.149 
get wet by with water so if you're out
there<00:01:22.689> even<00:01:23.080> though<00:01:23.290> it's<00:01:23.680> a<00:01:23.740> nice<00:01:23.920> sunny<00:01:24.100> day

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
there even though it's a nice sunny day

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.710 
there even though it's a nice sunny day
if<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.520> jump<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.030> get<00:01:25.120> your<00:01:25.300> clothes<00:01:25.510> wet

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
if you jump in and get your clothes wet

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.210 
if you jump in and get your clothes wet
and<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.900> winds<00:01:26.020> blowing<00:01:26.260> you'll<00:01:26.800> get<00:01:27.010> cold

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
and the winds blowing you'll get cold

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.920 
and the winds blowing you'll get cold
that's<00:01:27.640> what<00:01:27.820> happens<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.150> them<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:28.810> they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
that's what happens to them so they

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.719 
that's what happens to them so they
immediately<00:01:29.200> start<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.770> get<00:01:29.920> hypothermic<00:01:30.400> and

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
immediately start to get hypothermic and

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.280 
immediately start to get hypothermic and
they<00:01:30.909> start<00:01:31.180> preening<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.960> get<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.200> off

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
they start preening it to get it off

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.930 
they start preening it to get it off
their<00:01:32.470> feathers<00:01:32.620> in<00:01:33.070> doing<00:01:33.370> that<00:01:33.490> they<00:01:33.700> can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
their feathers in doing that they can

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.789 
their feathers in doing that they can
ingest<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.570> oil<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.990> eat<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.470> can

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
ingest the oil and eat it and that can

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.670 
ingest the oil and eat it and that can
be<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.520> affect<00:01:36.790> their<00:01:36.909> health<00:01:36.940> but<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:38.290> the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
be can affect their health but the the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.010 
be can affect their health but the the
initial<00:01:38.920> immediate<00:01:39.670> impact<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.840> it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
initial immediate impact is that is it

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.590 
initial immediate impact is that is it
external<00:01:41.680> it's<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.220> impairment<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.120> their

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
external it's the impairment of their

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.620 
external it's the impairment of their
waterproof<00:01:44.640> feathers<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.909> they<00:01:46.420> become

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
waterproof feathers so they become

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.870 
waterproof feathers so they become
hypothermic<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.619> heat<00:01:47.860> they<00:01:48.430> can<00:01:48.700> if

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
hypothermic in the heat they can if

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.010 
hypothermic in the heat they can if
they're<00:01:48.970> sitting<00:01:49.180> in<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.479> Sun<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.750> they<00:01:49.840> blow

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
they're sitting in the Sun and they blow

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
they're sitting in the Sun and they blow
em<00:01:50.170> they<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.440> actually<00:01:50.770> become<00:01:51.070> hypothermic

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
em they can actually become hypothermic

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.850 
em they can actually become hypothermic
which<00:01:52.000> means<00:01:52.210> they<00:01:52.299> can<00:01:52.450> overheat<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:53.710> what

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
which means they can overheat so what

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.280 
which means they can overheat so what
we're<00:01:54.010> doing<00:01:54.040> today<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.700> um<00:01:54.940> we're<00:01:55.840> washing<00:01:55.990> a

or kelp or plant stuff it's they're
clueless<00:02:29.390> about<00:02:29.659> it<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.230> then<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.069> sense

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
clueless about it so then in that sense

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.770

they're<00:02:31.549> vulnerable<00:02:31.700> she's<00:02:32.390> being<00:02:32.599> washed

they're vulnerable she's being washed
today<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.319> washing<00:02:33.680> process<00:02:33.890> really<00:02:34.459> is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
today and the washing process really is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.089 
today and the washing process really is
it's<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.720> quite<00:02:35.900> simple<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.709> have<00:02:36.739> to

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
it's really quite simple but you have to

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.649 
it's really quite simple but you have to
monitor<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.640> bird<00:02:37.879> while<00:02:38.060> you're<00:02:38.209> doing<00:02:38.510> it

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
monitor the bird while you're doing it

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.130 
monitor the bird while you're doing it
and<00:02:39.640> what<00:02:40.640> happens<00:02:40.909> is<00:02:41.060> they<00:02:41.360> pre<00:02:41.659> treated<00:02:42.049> her

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
and what happens is they pre treated her

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.770 
and what happens is they pre treated her
a<00:02:42.170> little<00:02:42.500> bit<00:02:42.620> with<00:02:42.769> some<00:02:43.299> canola<00:02:44.299> oil<00:02:44.629> which

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
a little bit with some canola oil which

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.809 
a little bit with some canola oil which
helps<00:02:45.109> loosen<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.530> oil<00:02:45.739> up<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.129> then<00:02:46.280> emits

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
helps loosen the oil up and then emits

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:47.949 
helps loosen the oil up and then emits
for<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.060> few<00:02:47.209> minutes<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.599> then<00:02:47.720> immediately

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
for a few minutes and then immediately

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.440 
for a few minutes and then immediately
she<00:02:48.349> goes<00:02:48.530> into<00:02:48.829> vats<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.340> Don<00:02:49.819> detergent

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
she goes into vats of Don detergent

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.569 
she goes into vats of Don detergent
which<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.079> a<00:02:51.109> small<00:02:51.500> percentage<00:02:51.709> -<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> lot<00:02:52.459> of

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
which is a small percentage - a lot of

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.520 
which is a small percentage - a lot of
warm<00:02:52.819> water<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.629> she's<00:02:53.810> paid<00:02:53.989> almost<00:02:54.409> like

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
warm water so she's paid almost like

rinse<00:03:22.250> station<00:03:22.760> where<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.299> high-pressure

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
rinse station where we use high-pressure

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.270 
rinse station where we use high-pressure
nozzles<00:03:24.260> with<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.500> same<00:03:24.680> temperature<00:03:24.980> water

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
nozzles with the same temperature water

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.339 
nozzles with the same temperature water
and<00:03:25.519> we<00:03:25.909> spray<00:03:26.239> all<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.569> soap<00:03:26.930> out<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.230> its

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
and we spray all the soap out of its

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.619 
and we spray all the soap out of its
feathers<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.920> this<00:03:28.700> amazing<00:03:29.120> thing<00:03:29.269> happens

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
feathers and this amazing thing happens

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.599 
feathers and this amazing thing happens
we<00:03:29.810> literally<00:03:30.079> dry<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.709> burst<00:03:31.069> feathers<00:03:31.459> with

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
we literally dry the burst feathers with

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.640 
we literally dry the burst feathers with
water<00:03:31.879> a<00:03:32.209> feather<00:03:32.569> on<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> bird<00:03:32.989> naturally

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
water a feather on a bird naturally

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.409 
water a feather on a bird naturally
repels<00:03:34.040> water<00:03:34.129> it<00:03:34.489> comes<00:03:34.730> right<00:03:34.879> off<00:03:34.940> event

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
repels water it comes right off event

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.960 
repels water it comes right off event
and<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.620> when<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.129> feathers<00:03:37.430> cleaned<00:03:37.760> from

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
and so when the feathers cleaned from

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.970 
and so when the feathers cleaned from
petroleum<00:03:38.540> oil<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.139> rinse<00:03:39.379> it<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
petroleum oil and we rinse it the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.890 
petroleum oil and we rinse it the
feathers<00:03:40.310> start<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.639> repel<00:03:40.940> water<00:03:40.970> they<00:03:41.750> all

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
feathers start to repel water they all

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.360 
feathers start to repel water they all
fluff<00:03:42.139> up<00:03:42.319> so<00:03:42.560> that's<00:03:42.709> what<00:03:42.859> we're<00:03:43.010> doing<00:03:43.250> with

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
fluff up so that's what we're doing with

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.680 
fluff up so that's what we're doing with
her

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
her

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.140 
her
and<00:03:45.290> then<00:03:45.710> she<00:03:45.890> just<00:03:46.130> will<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.700> then<00:03:46.970> she's<00:03:47.120> in

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
and then she just will and then she's in

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.630 
and then she just will and then she's in
the<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:48.140> post<00:03:48.380> wash<00:03:48.680> phase<00:03:49.010> which<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.310> just

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the the post wash phase which is just

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760 
the the post wash phase which is just
allowing<00:03:50.030> her<00:03:50.330> to<00:03:50.360> eat<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.870> lot<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.320> food<00:03:51.500> and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
allowing her to eat a lot of food and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.160 
allowing her to eat a lot of food and
rest<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:52.340> we<00:03:52.910> periodically<00:03:53.630> take<00:03:53.930> blood

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
rest and then we periodically take blood

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.930 
rest and then we periodically take blood
samples<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.650> make<00:03:54.800> sure<00:03:54.920> internally<00:03:55.700> she's

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
samples to make sure internally she's

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.470 
samples to make sure internally she's
okay

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
okay

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.980 
okay
and<00:03:56.570> if<00:03:57.170> she<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.380> she<00:03:57.890> gets<00:03:58.040> released<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:59.660> the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
and if she is she gets released so the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:10.900 
and if she is she gets released so the
prognosis<00:04:00.230> is<00:04:00.710> pretty<00:04:01.010> good

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.970
