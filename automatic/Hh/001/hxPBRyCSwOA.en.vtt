container because I wasn't sure if the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
container because I wasn't sure if the
refrigerator<00:01:25.439> method<00:01:25.920> would<00:01:26.070> work<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
refrigerator method would work but it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.929 
refrigerator method would work but it
did<00:01:27.689> work<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.500> any<00:01:28.740> method<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.759> work

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
did work so any method would really work

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this one only put a couple of seeds so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.300

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the lemongrass I did have to raise the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
the lemongrass I did have to raise the
water<00:01:38.070> container<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> water<00:01:39.780> level

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
water container I mean the water level

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
water container I mean the water level
higher<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> roots<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.689> roots

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
higher is because of the roots the roots

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
higher is because of the roots the roots
are<00:01:43.079> continuously<00:01:43.799> forming<00:01:44.399> growing

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
are continuously forming growing

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.630 
are continuously forming growing
extending<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
extending and that is really good so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
extending and that is really good so
good<00:01:47.790> sign<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> plant<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> doing<00:01:48.869> really

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
good sign that the plant is doing really

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.889 
good sign that the plant is doing really
well<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.799> another<00:01:50.790> great<00:01:51.119> sign<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.509> show<00:01:51.570> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
well and another great sign to show that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
well and another great sign to show that
the<00:01:52.049> plant<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.649> doing<00:01:52.860> well<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the plant is really doing well is the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.980 
the plant is really doing well is the
leaves<00:01:55.490> new<00:01:56.490> leaves<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:57.060> coming<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.869> this
