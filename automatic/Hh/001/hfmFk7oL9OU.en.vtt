00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.850
 reflections on mobile phone displays are 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.890
 of course a big problem and stuff 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.680
 that's actually easy to solve 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.630
 not so theoretically one could yes 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.050
 actually expect that as with 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.820
 a conventional pc monitor too 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.440
 Just make that the surface 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.230
 bit roughened and that by 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.879
 by reflection the reflection is not 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.780
 more so when reading that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.400
 disturb display 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 but that's not so easy because 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.920
 the larger the gap is between the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.780
 layer where the picture ultimately generates 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.579
 and where the surface is roughened 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.200
 the blurrier the picture becomes 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.300
 Of course that is one point 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.190
 and the second point is through this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.440
 Surface spill is it that way 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.120
 that under gram maybe not yet 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.260
 but somehow the picture can be recognized 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 by having a rough surface 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.380
 The whole thing is scattered 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.580
 bild then stop very moderately and could 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.140
 I already imagine that for many 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.030
 Customers if you like this one hand 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.490
 have a look at the shop 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.990
 under supermarket or electromarket 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 lighting interest without them now 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.069
 but somehow everything is possible 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.069
 and that's why it's usually always 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:28.250
 still leaving the display surface and 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.330
 the touch surfaces are shiny 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.550
 and are not marked 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.899
 because you could now as a manufacturer too 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.610
 Well that justifies if I have one now 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.530
 reflecting light source has to one 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.990
 lamp then i can display the mobile phone 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.700
 just turn a bit and also 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.039
 then the player is out of sight 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 out and by that it just one 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.390
 Smooth surface is not holding up 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 is the whole area of the screen on 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.619
 An argument of course one 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.759
 piece can even be valid 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.800
 of course, playing nerves of course 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.599
 tremendous 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.610
 that's why there are some 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.580
 Manufacturers try a reflection 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.170
 layers on the surface to apply 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.020
 That's what you have to do in principle 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.319
 imagine how a mirrored 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.270
 glasses is part of the solution 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.680
 completely one hundred percent avoidance 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.310
 of reflections one achieves thereby 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 not and the reflections you still have 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.819
 Looks you have then mostly 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.760
 they will turn green or purple 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.300
 colors and that bothers many people too 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.300
 very strong 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.749
 now can not handle it 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.849
 Just try using with display 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.469
 Protective films to experiment with the man 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.739
 stop on the internet for a few euros 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.659
 because there are models that stop 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.180
 try by a slight threat 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.319
 to avoid reflections and or man 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.079
 also takes the same mirror and 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.639
 slides and a bit too 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.829
 It's worthwhile experimenting because one does 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.409
 anyway mostly alone from scratch protection 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.669
 set quite like a film on his 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.669
 would like to stick mobile phone display
