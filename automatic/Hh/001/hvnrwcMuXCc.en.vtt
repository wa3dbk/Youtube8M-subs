00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.800
 from santiago de compostela writes us Carlos 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.680
 he just graduated as a civil engineer and would like to get the title 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.600
 Occupational Risk Prevention Officer that's why he asks us 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.529
 What is the difference between the course and a master's degree in risk prevention? 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.970
 and vocational training and how it influences when it comes to finding 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:24.569
 work 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.639
 good key you also want to know the one that attended recognized offer 

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:32.270
 online and if you could do it if you could get it through the unefa 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.850
 distance 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 Well, first of all, the difference between the two is true. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.720
 of occupational risk prevention we have courses or training 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.240
 professional and we have closer 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.870
 in the main difference is the type of training that the semas specialized in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.800
 the case of the pro masters of professional training that simply 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.810
 a course munné the hours or obviously are not the same 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.940
 because the masters tend to be 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.890
 these years the professional training also and the course is usually 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.170
 how many months with which what opens more the doors of the market 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.250
 work followed a master's degree and not only because of the master's degree but also 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 because it will also complement the training Carlos has in the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.140
 road engineering the one from which he has already obtained the degree 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.550
 corresponding to what he tells us about the possibility of giving 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.160
 blindness courses that are homologated in question d is fine because 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.160
 percent evidently the client universities in at recognized that level of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.610
 studies is therefore offering a teaching that in the labor market can 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.430
 serve to find him work and then there may be other types of entities 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 that maybe they are not in say that officially approved but yes by 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.340
 hundred and open the doors 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.770
 if you have a cache let's say in the market 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.180
 the labor are the two conditions that the baby per cent look at when 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.180
 choose percent a course in this case a master that is what we 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.460
 We would recommend it is true that what you have to do is if you gave it a 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.690
 public university than the master's degree and is adapted to the Bologna plan because 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.290
 hamás percent that will imply that not only be recognized here 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.300
 in Spain, yes, not in the whole European Union, with which you can open 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.190
 still much more the doors of the labor market asks us about the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.720
 we have seen that in the course 2009 2010 unites a master in 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.299
 prevention of occupational risks but reviewing the schedule for the course 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.579
 next that master 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.479
 has disappeared with which we do not know if it was going to be possible but 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.109
 We are going to provide a telephone number so that you can report and be able to 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.219
 consult it is 9 0 2 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.860
 the 388 8 8 8 is the phone 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.890
 the student service of the national university of education 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.170
 ready 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.659
 and another alternative since it is not written from La Coruña 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.650
 tell you that the sports science faculty below the University of the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.689
 Coruña if it offers sd closer to him what happens is that it would be face-to-face with 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.349
 which should also assess if you compensate with a reward in principle 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.189
 for he is still there we have left the tlc
