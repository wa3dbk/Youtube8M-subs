crazy of course not of course it could
ruin<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.380> 11<00:00:19.830> course<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> be

ruin this 11 course is going to be
windows<00:00:20.850> 12<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> continue<00:00:22.010> well

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
windows 12 it's going to continue well

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
windows 12 it's going to continue well
maybe<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.150> according<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
maybe not and this is according to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
maybe not and this is according to
Microsoft's<00:00:25.680> Jerry<00:00:26.039> Nixon<00:00:26.609> he<00:00:26.939> said<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
Microsoft's Jerry Nixon he said that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
Microsoft's Jerry Nixon he said that
right<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.720> we're<00:00:27.930> releasing<00:00:28.170> Windows<00:00:28.619> 10<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
right now we're releasing Windows 10 and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.009 
right now we're releasing Windows 10 and
because<00:00:29.340> Windows<00:00:29.640> 10<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> last<00:00:30.449> version

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
because Windows 10 is the last version

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.830 
because Windows 10 is the last version
of<00:00:31.349> windows<00:00:31.679> were<00:00:32.250> still<00:00:32.489> working<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.450> Windows

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
of windows were still working on Windows

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.030 
of windows were still working on Windows
10<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.950> indeed<00:00:36.290> Microsoft<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> saying<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
10 and indeed Microsoft is saying to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
10 and indeed Microsoft is saying to
anyone<00:00:38.460> who<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:38.670> listen<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> future

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
anyone who will listen that the future

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860 
anyone who will listen that the future
is<00:00:40.230> windows<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> service<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> Microsoft

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
is windows as a service and Microsoft

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
is windows as a service and Microsoft
have<00:00:42.989> discussed<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.620> several<00:00:43.829> times<00:00:44.219> over

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
have discussed this several times over

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
have discussed this several times over
and<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> an<00:00:45.780> odd<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.320> odd<00:00:47.010> plan

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and it's a bit of an odd an odd plan

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.959 
and it's a bit of an odd an odd plan
possibly<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.840> theory<00:00:49.730> what<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> will

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
possibly in theory what it will

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
possibly in theory what it will
basically<00:00:51.149> means<00:00:51.690> Microsoft<00:00:52.469> will<00:00:53.129> possibly

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
basically means Microsoft will possibly

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.229 
basically means Microsoft will possibly
do<00:00:54.149> regular<00:00:54.840> updates<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.620> windows<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
do regular updates to windows and the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.029 
do regular updates to windows and the
core<00:00:57.510> version<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.079> currently<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.649> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
core version that we currently have and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
core version that we currently have and
part<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.109> Microsoft

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
part of this reason is because Microsoft

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670 
part of this reason is because Microsoft
are<00:01:01.920> pushing<00:01:02.250> towards<00:01:02.640> multiple<00:01:03.239> devices<00:01:03.680> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
are pushing towards multiple devices so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
are pushing towards multiple devices so
rather<00:01:05.010> than<00:01:05.189> having<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.820> core<00:01:07.430> service<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.640> core

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
rather than having a core service a core

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.560 
rather than having a core service a core
operating<00:01:09.479> system<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:11.570> everything

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
operating system that's everything

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480 
operating system that's everything
tightly<00:01:13.229> revolved<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:13.799> Microsoft

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
tightly revolved around Microsoft

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
tightly revolved around Microsoft
instead<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> putting<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> splitting<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
instead of putting it and splitting it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
instead of putting it and splitting it
up<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.070> example<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.759> Start<00:01:18.060> menu<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
up so for example the Start menu the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.749 
up so for example the Start menu the
built-in<00:01:19.020> applications<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:20.070> part<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
built-in applications are all part and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.550 
built-in applications are all part and
parcel<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.049> updateable<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:25.140> therefore

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
parcel and updateable and that therefore

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
parcel and updateable and that therefore
theoretically<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
theoretically what they can do is just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
theoretically what they can do is just
go<00:01:27.900> ahead<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> release<00:01:28.530> an<00:01:28.829> update<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.520> say

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
go ahead and release an update let's say

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
go ahead and release an update let's say
in<00:01:29.790> six<00:01:30.090> months<00:01:30.240> time<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.810> 10<00:01:31.079> months<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:31.619> or

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
in six months time or 10 months time or

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.609 
in six months time or 10 months time or
12<00:01:32.070> months<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.850> 24<00:01:33.840> months<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.409> which

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
12 months time or 24 months time which

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
12 months time or 24 months time which
will<00:01:34.890> improve<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.000> functionality<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
will improve the functionality and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
will improve the functionality and
therefore<00:01:37.909> theoretically<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.439> mean<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.829> they

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
therefore theoretically I mean that they

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.969 
therefore theoretically I mean that they
won't<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.299> need<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> Windows<00:01:43.560> 10<00:01:44.060> now

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
won't really need to be a Windows 10 now

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.520 
won't really need to be a Windows 10 now
redstone<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.000> plan<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.780> 2016

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
redstone is going to be in plan for 2016

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.590 
redstone is going to be in plan for 2016
and<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> hell<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.549> redstone<00:01:51.270> redstone

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.539 
and what the hell is redstone redstone
is<00:01:52.079> effectively<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> as

is effectively you could think of it as

is effectively you could think of it as
windows<00:01:53.909> 10.1<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.369> give<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.640> idea

those<00:02:13.020> plans<00:02:13.319> are

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
those plans are

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.180 
those plans are
b-but<00:02:14.849> most<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> most<00:02:16.409> these<00:02:16.590> updates

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
b-but most of the most these updates

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.539 
b-but most of the most these updates
according<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.170> internet<00:02:19.590> mostly<00:02:20.190> verge

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
according to the internet mostly verge

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.089 
according to the internet mostly verge
but<00:02:20.909> there<00:02:21.090> are<00:02:21.330> other<00:02:21.629> sources<00:02:22.019> as<00:02:22.349> well<00:02:22.379> and

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
but there are other sources as well and

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.250 
but there are other sources as well and
they<00:02:23.549> are<00:02:23.700> stating<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.750> updates<00:02:25.140> are

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
they are stating that the updates are

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.080 
they are stating that the updates are
primarily<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.159> be<00:02:26.250> targeted<00:02:26.459> towards

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
primarily going to be targeted towards

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.369 
primarily going to be targeted towards

surface hollow lens office Xbox of

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.149 
surface hollow lens office Xbox of
course<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.450> even<00:02:33.450> even<00:02:34.319> some<00:02:34.560> references<00:02:35.099> to

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
course and even even some references to

course and even even some references to
Minecraft<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.120> obviously<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.170> how<00:02:37.319> much<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
Minecraft but obviously just how much of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.660 
Minecraft but obviously just how much of
that<00:02:37.799> is<00:02:38.129> actually<00:02:38.760> true<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.420> don't<00:02:39.989> know<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
that is actually true I don't know the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.819 
that is actually true I don't know the
odd<00:02:41.909> thing<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.480> well<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:43.079> all<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.379> this<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
odd thing as well with all of this is

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.150 
odd thing as well with all of this is
that<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.790> actually<00:02:45.000> happens<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.349> could

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
that if this actually happens it could

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.490 
that if this actually happens it could
really<00:02:47.370> pave<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.940> way<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.120> Microsoft<00:02:49.019> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.050 

become<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> lot<00:02:52.739> more<00:02:52.769> free<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.879> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
become a lot more free with it and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.599 
become a lot more free with it and
actually<00:02:54.510> provide<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.349> lot<00:02:55.739> better<00:02:55.920> service

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
actually provide a lot better service

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.940 
actually provide a lot better service
because<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.599> of<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.780> problems<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.470> Windows

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
because one of the problems of Windows

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.259 
because one of the problems of Windows
is<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.700> becomes<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.329> know<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.760> becomes<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
is that it becomes you know it becomes a

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.630 
is that it becomes you know it becomes a
major<00:03:03.599> undertaking<00:03:04.109> for<00:03:04.500> anyone<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.129> upgrade

major undertaking for anyone to upgrade

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.550 
major undertaking for anyone to upgrade
the<00:03:05.819> operating<00:03:06.329> system<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.109> on<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the operating system and so on it's a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.110 
the operating system and so on it's a
bit<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.950> pain<00:03:08.129> in<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.340> butt<00:03:08.549> particularly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
bit of a pain in the butt particularly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920 
bit of a pain in the butt particularly
if<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:12.359> just<00:03:12.569> want<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> get

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
if you know you you just want to get

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.649 
if you know you you just want to get
things<00:03:13.200> done<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.609> for<00:03:14.849> people<00:03:15.180> who<00:03:15.329> aren't

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
things done and for people who aren't

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.879 
things done and for people who aren't
particularly<00:03:16.190> tech-savvy<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:19.319> idea<00:03:19.739> of

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
particularly tech-savvy it's the idea of

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.800 
particularly tech-savvy it's the idea of
switching<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.519> another<00:03:20.669> operating<00:03:21.150> system<00:03:21.660> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
switching to another operating system it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.500 
switching to another operating system it
can<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.169> a<00:03:22.200> bit<00:03:22.349> daunting<00:03:22.919> and<00:03:23.269> because<00:03:24.269> some

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
can be a bit daunting and because some

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.680 
can be a bit daunting and because some
people<00:03:24.840> had<00:03:25.290> concerns<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.790> know<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.359> up

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
people had concerns of you know is is up

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.970 
people had concerns of you know is is up
they<00:03:27.870> going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.169> break<00:03:28.380> my<00:03:28.410> driver

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
they going to break my driver

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.920 
they going to break my driver
compatibility<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.419> going<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.629> lose<00:03:30.750> my

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
compatibility is it going to lose my

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.460 
compatibility is it going to lose my
files<00:03:31.319> if<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.769> update<00:03:32.220> from<00:03:32.519> say<00:03:32.730> windows<00:03:33.150> or

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
files if I update from say windows or

files if I update from say windows or
would<00:03:34.470> say<00:03:34.680> windows<00:03:35.069> vista<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.970> windows<00:03:36.120> seven

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
would say windows vista to windows seven

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.440 
would say windows vista to windows seven
theoretically<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.760> will<00:03:38.940> no<00:03:39.060> longer<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.419> the

theoretically this will no longer be the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.110 
theoretically this will no longer be the
case<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:40.049> theory<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.459> will<00:03:41.609> mean<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.819> you're

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
case in theory it will mean that you're

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.900 
case in theory it will mean that you're
going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> get<00:03:42.419> a<00:03:42.480> much<00:03:42.750> more<00:03:43.220> streamlined<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
going to get a much more streamlined and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.539 
going to get a much more streamlined and
seamless<00:03:45.510> update<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.349> transition<00:03:46.919> now<00:03:47.459> I'm

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
seamless update and transition now I'm

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.890 
seamless update and transition now I'm
not<00:03:47.699> necessarily<00:03:48.180> saying<00:03:48.569> that<00:03:48.750> they'll

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
not necessarily saying that they'll

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.110 
not necessarily saying that they'll
never<00:03:49.199> do<00:03:49.590> windows<00:03:49.949> 11<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.790> they're<00:03:50.970> not

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
never do windows 11 and they're not

never do windows 11 and they're not

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
necessarily saying well I guess they

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.970 
necessarily saying well I guess they
kind<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.840> know<00:03:54.959> 15<00:03:55.440> years<00:03:55.470> down

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
kind of are but you know 15 years down

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.229 
kind of are but you know 15 years down
the<00:03:56.190> line<00:03:56.220> now<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.730> still<00:03:56.940> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> be

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
the line now we still going to be

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.809 
the line now we still going to be
Windows<00:03:57.569> 10<00:03:57.810> well<00:03:58.590> who<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> hell<00:03:59.340> knows<00:03:59.609> at

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
Windows 10 well who the hell knows at

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.569 
Windows 10 well who the hell knows at
that<00:03:59.940> point<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.299> might<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.720> be<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.139> cloud

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
that point we might all be on the cloud

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.610 
that point we might all be on the cloud
but<00:04:02.579> for<00:04:02.819> now<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.329> can<00:04:03.930> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.349> see<00:04:04.470> what

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
but for now I can kind of see what

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.650 
but for now I can kind of see what
Microsoft's<00:04:05.160> coming<00:04:05.430> from<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.879> do<00:04:05.940> like

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
Microsoft's coming from and I do like

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.599 
Microsoft's coming from and I do like
the<00:04:06.870> idea<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.379> incremental<00:04:08.010> update<00:04:08.370> since

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
the idea of incremental update since

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.900 
the idea of incremental update since
it's<00:04:09.209> slightly<00:04:09.930> more<00:04:10.349> Apple<00:04:10.769> esque<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.519> that

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
it's slightly more Apple esque if that

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.080 
it's slightly more Apple esque if that
is<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.810> thing<00:04:13.280> but<00:04:14.280> anyway<00:04:14.579> hopefully<00:04:14.849> you've

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
is a thing but anyway hopefully you've
