coffee<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.950> instead<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.520> happens<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
coffee and instead what happens is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900 
coffee and instead what happens is
coffee<00:00:36.780> overflows<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.309> gets<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
coffee overflows and it gets all on the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
coffee overflows and it gets all on the
Keurig<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.629> gets<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:39.930> gross<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
Keurig and it gets all gross and you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.900 
Keurig and it gets all gross and you
gotta<00:00:40.860> clean<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> stuff

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

but<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.290> simple<00:00:43.590> solution<00:00:44.300> very

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
but there's a very simple solution very

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.029 
but there's a very simple solution very
simple<00:00:45.780> I'm<00:00:45.960> pretty<00:00:46.410> sure<00:00:46.559> most<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> guys

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
simple I'm pretty sure most of you guys

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.260 
simple I'm pretty sure most of you guys
have<00:00:47.160> figured<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.850> by<00:00:48.059> now

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
have figured it out by now

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
have figured it out by now
but<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.320> case<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.620> there's<00:00:49.800> someone<00:00:50.039> out

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
but just in case if there's someone out

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
but just in case if there's someone out
there<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.579> didn't<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.420> on

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
