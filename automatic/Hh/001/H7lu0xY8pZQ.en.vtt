00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 My name is Claudio, and I am responsible. 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.059
 by the area of ​​geometry of the whim 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.139
 Vehicles from jacarei são josé / caçapava a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.450
 geometry 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 it consists of several angles including 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.920
 the alignment that everyone knows in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.840
 geometry 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 she has several doubts I'll try 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.510
 clarify for you some of them 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.090
 because to correct the geometry of the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.789
 vehicle is to avoid wear 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 premature of the suspension of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.630
 tires and also bring more comfort to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 in the middle of the driver when the vehicle is not 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.860
 shows no defect as a vehicle 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.289
 pull sideways singing in a curve 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 vibration on the steering wheel stability straight is 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.280
 alignment of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 direction 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 yes it is necessary to align 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.230
 direction because when the vehicle 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.660
 some effect of this type is that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.390
 it already encounters a deformation the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 11 dangerous suspension of the opponent 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.350
 gm direction 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.470
 she recommends aligning 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 direction according to the conditions of use 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.229
 if you catch a lot of sierra if you 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 press hard to catch the impact 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.860
 with the wheels and cost days should be 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.580
 made the verified alignment of 54 thousand 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 kilometers and tire calibration 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 you should check for any damage 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.229
 on the treadmill - if there is a 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.490
 a hood closer to you when 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.479
 we should make the disclosure of tapping 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.189
 it must be made up to 15 days 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.490
 respecting the pressures that gender and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.439
 these precious stones are located 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 in the owner's manual 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.729
 behind the fuel curtain and into the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.229
 driver's door sill and the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 casters tire 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.600
 the day of the periods must be done 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.479
 as a new owner does not 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.840
 receiving the 10 thousand kilometers 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.819
 When you're going to make the rotation do the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.420
 also to avoid 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.750
 peeling uneven tire wear 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.630
 a tip we set up to do a rotation 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.319
 with 5,000 kilometers when we should 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.379
 to change the tires we have a tire 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.140
 durability of 40,000 names rolled 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:41.660
 if there is no defect in the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.379
 tread where they touch the ground 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.019
 we must and by the safety index that 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:03:00.599
 is located on the side of the tire 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:03:01.549
 this index may be right or try 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.910
 forbid 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.260
 Good folks, for now, it's just thanks to 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.410
 all 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.620
 if you have any questions ask 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.370
 on the blog or come on whim closer 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.359
 from you 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.359
 we are waiting
