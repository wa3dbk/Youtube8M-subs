00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and so it's a pregnancy scam today but

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.890 
and so it's a pregnancy scam today but
also<00:00:15.959> it's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> fetal<00:00:16.710> sexing<00:00:19.160> she's<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.310> fall

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
also it's a fetal sexing she's in fall

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:32.089 
also it's a fetal sexing she's in fall
fall<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.079> a<00:00:22.110> heartbeat<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.769> fault<00:00:31.099> we

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
fall as a heartbeat it's our fault we

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
fall as a heartbeat it's our fault we
have<00:00:32.220> them<00:00:32.369> another<00:00:32.640> fall<00:00:33.050> gestured<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> fall

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
have them another fall gestured the fall

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.030 
have them another fall gestured the fall
with<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> we're<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> optimize<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
with so we're just going to optimize the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
with so we're just going to optimize the
image<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.400> bit<00:00:41.059> manipulate<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> probe

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
image a little bit manipulate the probe

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.799 
image a little bit manipulate the probe
turn<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.900> program<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
turn the program so there we have the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.369 
turn the program so there we have the
following<00:00:46.379> long<00:00:46.890> section

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379

we're<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.880> looking<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.300> this<00:01:12.420> area<00:01:12.479> here

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
we're gonna be looking in this area here

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.700 
we're gonna be looking in this area here
for<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> genital<00:01:13.890> tubercle

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.320 

okay<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.490> with<00:01:21.730> this<00:01:21.850> coming<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.210> can

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
okay this with this coming you can

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.460 
okay this with this coming you can
actually<00:01:22.540> freeze<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.930> image<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.230> you've<00:01:23.320> got

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
actually freeze the image and you've got

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.050 
actually freeze the image and you've got
a<00:01:23.500> cine<00:01:23.740> loop<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.400> scroll<00:01:24.700> through

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
a cine loop so you can scroll through

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.600 
a cine loop so you can scroll through
the<00:01:25.300> image<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.350> acquire<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.890> stereo<00:01:27.220> want

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
the image to acquire the stereo want

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.730 
the image to acquire the stereo want
let's<00:01:28.480> feel<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.840> we're<00:01:28.960> looking<00:01:29.050> at<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.530> here

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
let's feel that we're looking at is here

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.130 
let's feel that we're looking at is here
we've<00:01:29.890> got<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.160> two<00:01:30.310> stifles<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.720> there<00:01:31.990> is

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
we've got the two stifles and there is

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.810 
we've got the two stifles and there is
the<00:01:32.230> genital<00:01:32.620> tubercle<00:01:32.890> which<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.490> actually

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
the genital tubercle which is actually

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.180 
the genital tubercle which is actually
just<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.330> front<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> two<00:01:34.960> back<00:01:35.200> legs<00:01:35.229> so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
just in front of the two back legs so

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.350 
just in front of the two back legs so
based<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:36.729> we're<00:01:37.030> dealing<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.420> cold

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
based on that we're dealing with a cold

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.330 
based on that we're dealing with a cold
which<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.510> a<00:01:40.540> good<00:01:40.720> result<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:45.010> what<00:01:45.220> we're

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
which is a good result so what we're

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.910 
which is a good result so what we're
gonna<00:01:45.400> do<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.850> we're<00:01:46.060> just<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.920> change

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
gonna do is we're just going to change

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440 
gonna do is we're just going to change
the<00:01:48.070> orientation<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.760> probe<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.300> can

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the orientation of the probe so we can

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.300 
the orientation of the probe so we can
get<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.690> fall<00:01:49.900> in<00:01:50.380> cross<00:01:53.280> double-check<00:01:54.280> that

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
get the fall in cross double-check that

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.910 
get the fall in cross double-check that
we're<00:01:54.640> dealing<00:01:54.759> with<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.060> cold

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
we're dealing with a cold

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.620 
we're dealing with a cold
this<00:01:56.920> image<00:01:57.250> I've<00:01:57.880> turned<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.210> probe<00:01:58.420> through

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
this image I've turned the probe through

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.290 
this image I've turned the probe through
90<00:01:58.930> degrees<00:01:59.200> now<00:02:03.180> optimize<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.390> image

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
90 degrees now optimize the image

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.340 
90 degrees now optimize the image
