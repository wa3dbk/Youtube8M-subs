00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like to apply before I hit like I'll run

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
like to apply before I hit like I'll run
far<00:00:52.230> away<00:00:52.289> hit<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:53.190> miss<00:00:53.760> near<00:00:54.000> drum<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
far away hit i miss near drum like on it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.889 
far away hit i miss near drum like on it
up<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.489> strim<00:00:57.300> attic<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> cool

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
up right it's just strim attic and cool

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.950 
up right it's just strim attic and cool
again<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.670> another<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
again so that's one for it another one I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
again so that's one for it another one I
like<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.430> even<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
like to use and even that's like a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.990 
like to use and even that's like a
bigger<00:01:03.390> break<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.850> tends<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
bigger break because it's what tends to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
bigger break because it's what tends to
be<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.240> bit<00:01:06.510> more<00:01:06.780> tricky<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.640> have

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
be a little bit more tricky and you have

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
be a little bit more tricky and you have
a<00:01:08.850> better<00:01:08.970> chance<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.900> losing

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
a better chance of actually like losing

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.620 
a better chance of actually like losing
the<00:01:10.590> stick<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the stick so I do it when there's like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.760 
the stick so I do it when there's like
maybe<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> bigger<00:01:13.110> break<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.590> just

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
maybe a bigger break when I just

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
maybe a bigger break when I just
stomping<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> kick<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
stomping on the kick or something like a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
stomping on the kick or something like a
break<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.540> supposed<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> risky<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.939> it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
break just supposed to risky so it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
break just supposed to risky so it's
called<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> thumb<00:01:21.869> spin<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
called the around the thumb spin and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
called the around the thumb spin and
basically<00:01:23.880> again<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.960> names<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
basically again the names are very so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.390 
basically again the names are very so
expected<00:01:26.420> it's<00:01:27.420> wrong<00:01:27.659> thumb<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.650> looks<00:01:29.340> like

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
expected it's wrong thumb so looks like

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
expected it's wrong thumb so looks like
this<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> closer<00:01:30.869> view<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> you're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
this are you in closer view so you're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
this are you in closer view so you're
pushing<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.040> middle<00:01:35.189> finger<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.990> up

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
pushing with your middle finger here up

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
pushing with your middle finger here up
against<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> stick<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.759> just

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
against the stick and it's going to just

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
against the stick and it's going to just
so<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> can't<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.869> slow<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.619> hold<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so I can't do it slow and not hold it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
so I can't do it slow and not hold it
and<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.240> around<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:43.020> thumb

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and you're going to go around your thumb

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.270 
and you're going to go around your thumb
and<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.009> catch<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> back<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> fully<00:01:46.740> whoops

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and I catch it back here so fully whoops

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
and I catch it back here so fully whoops
I<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:50.149> around<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> thumb<00:01:51.479> give

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
I so here we go around the thumb give

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.999 
I so here we go around the thumb give
you<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.179 

so<00:01:58.009> there's<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.399> one<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.780> said<00:02:00.039> if<00:02:01.039> you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
so there's that one like I said if you

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.560 
so there's that one like I said if you
can<00:02:01.340> nail<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.700> trick<00:02:01.969> and<00:02:02.390> you're<00:02:02.479> really

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
can nail this trick and you're really

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.300 
can nail this trick and you're really
comfortable<00:02:02.780> with<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.170> feel<00:02:03.740> free<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.979> throw

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
comfortable with it feel free to throw

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.179 
comfortable with it feel free to throw
it<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.579> like<00:02:04.759> whatever<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.179> want<00:02:05.469> but<00:02:06.469> I<00:02:06.679> tell
