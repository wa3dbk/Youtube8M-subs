00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
as much maintenance as pcs and they have

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.540 
as much maintenance as pcs and they have
fewer<00:00:59.910> viruses<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
stuff it would be easier to get the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
stuff it would be easier to get the
software<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.409> finding<00:01:16.860> Mac<00:01:17.100> compatible

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
software okay that is a good point

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.620 
software okay that is a good point
I<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.900> cannot<00:01:22.350> choose<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.420> so
