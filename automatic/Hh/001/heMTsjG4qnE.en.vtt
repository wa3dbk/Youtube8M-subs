00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
that have really stood out for me the

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.670 
that have really stood out for me the
first<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.130> Civello<00:00:24.580> s5<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.440> sabelo<00:00:26.440> are

version as well weight is exactly the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.930 
version as well weight is exactly the
same<00:00:38.110> thanks<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:38.890> carbon<00:00:39.400> technologies

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
same thanks to the carbon technologies

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.880 
same thanks to the carbon technologies
that<00:00:40.090> they<00:00:40.210> use<00:00:40.239> with<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.780> r5<00:00:41.379> California

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
that they use with the r5 California

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.080 
that they use with the r5 California
project<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.390> those<00:00:43.840> see<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.610> carbon<00:00:45.610> layups

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
project so those see a carbon layups

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.840 
project so those see a carbon layups
they're<00:00:46.329> now<00:00:46.480> using<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.410> s5<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.460> maintain

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
they're now using on the s5 to maintain

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.360 
they're now using on the s5 to maintain
the<00:00:49.030> weight<00:00:49.210> improve<00:00:49.469> stiffness<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.649> make<00:00:51.219> it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
the weight improve stiffness and make it

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
the weight improve stiffness and make it
faster<00:00:51.850> ultimately<00:00:52.210> they've<00:00:52.510> done<00:00:52.690> lots<00:00:52.840> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
faster ultimately they've done lots of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920 
faster ultimately they've done lots of
Windtunnel<00:00:54.160> just<00:00:54.670> experimenting<00:00:55.600> rather

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
Windtunnel just experimenting rather

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.720 
Windtunnel just experimenting rather
than<00:00:56.170> just<00:00:56.559> validating<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.430> they've<00:00:57.579> been

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
than just validating so they've been

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.430 
than just validating so they've been
fiddling<00:00:58.120> with<00:00:58.239> different<00:00:58.510> things<00:00:58.690> finding

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
fiddling with different things finding

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080 
fiddling with different things finding
out<00:00:59.590> what<00:00:59.800> works<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.370> they<00:01:00.489> worked<00:01:00.700> out<00:01:00.879> that

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
out what works so they worked out that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.990 
out what works so they worked out that
the<00:01:01.300> top<00:01:01.600> tube<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.500> chainstays<00:01:03.280> don't

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
the top tube and the chainstays don't

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.480 
the top tube and the chainstays don't
actually<00:01:04.210> affect<00:01:04.449> aerodynamics<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:06.340> they've

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
actually affect aerodynamics so they've

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.719 
actually affect aerodynamics so they've
lifted<00:01:06.820> those<00:01:07.119> directly<00:01:07.780> from<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.350> sabelo<00:01:09.130> r5

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
lifted those directly from the sabelo r5

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.999 
lifted those directly from the sabelo r5
CA<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.450> put<00:01:11.110> them<00:01:11.229> straight<00:01:11.380> on<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.649> new<00:01:11.770> bike

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
CA and put them straight on the new bike

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.190 
CA and put them straight on the new bike
so<00:01:12.550> essentially<00:01:13.180> more<00:01:13.420> surface<00:01:13.810> area<00:01:13.960> for

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
so essentially more surface area for

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
so essentially more surface area for
better<00:01:14.470> aerodynamics<00:01:15.030> better<00:01:16.030> stiffness<00:01:16.600> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
better aerodynamics better stiffness and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370 
better aerodynamics better stiffness and
just<00:01:18.610> faster<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:19.810> that'll<00:01:20.049> be<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.170> really

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
just faster so that'll be a really

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.810 
just faster so that'll be a really
exciting<00:01:20.710> bike<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.549> we'll<00:01:21.640> be<00:01:21.729> looking

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
exciting bike that we'll be looking

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.490 
exciting bike that we'll be looking
forward<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.210> review<00:01:22.479> later<00:01:22.689> in<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:22.990> air<00:01:23.110> so

forward to review later in the air so

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.200 
forward to review later in the air so

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the british car company Caterham has

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.940 
the british car company Caterham has
decided<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.810> go<00:01:25.990> into<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.200> bike<00:01:26.409> market<00:01:26.770> which

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
decided to go into the bike market which

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.200 
decided to go into the bike market which
is<00:01:27.070> kind<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.280> interesting<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.939> itself

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
is kind of interesting in and of itself

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.560 
is kind of interesting in and of itself
they<00:01:28.900> didn't<00:01:29.140> really<00:01:29.259> go<00:01:29.500> into<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
they didn't really go into it in a you

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
they didn't really go into it in a you
know<00:01:31.600> they<00:01:31.900> wanted<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.259> build<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.650> lightest

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
know they wanted to build the lightest

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.760 
know they wanted to build the lightest
or<00:01:33.400> stiffest<00:01:33.939> or<00:01:34.210> some<00:01:34.990> aerodynamic<00:01:35.259> bike

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
or stiffest or some aerodynamic bike

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.469 
or stiffest or some aerodynamic bike
sort<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.100> thing<00:01:36.250> they<00:01:36.880> kinda<00:01:37.119> just<00:01:37.150> wanted<00:01:37.420> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
sort of thing they kinda just wanted to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.700 
sort of thing they kinda just wanted to
make<00:01:37.600> something<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.960> was<00:01:38.080> really<00:01:38.409> super

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
make something that was really super

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.550 
make something that was really super
cool<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.340> paid<00:01:40.329> proper<00:01:40.900> homage<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.380> name

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
cool that paid proper homage to the name

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600 
cool that paid proper homage to the name
so<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> bike<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:42.880> absolutely<00:01:43.390> beautiful<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so the bike is absolutely beautiful and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.789 
so the bike is absolutely beautiful and
it's<00:01:45.610> built<00:01:46.150> by<00:01:46.329> ax<00:01:46.600> lightness<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.110> germany<00:01:47.470> so

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
it's built by ax lightness in germany so

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.620 
it's built by ax lightness in germany so
they<00:01:48.070> definitely<00:01:48.189> tap<00:01:48.909> into<00:01:49.329> a<00:01:49.360> very

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630

actually completely made out of
corrugated<00:05:20.340> cardboard<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:22.880> would<00:05:23.880> assume<00:05:24.030> the

corrugated cardboard I would assume the
corrugated<00:05:24.570> cardboard<00:05:24.870> was<00:05:25.200> probably<00:05:25.470> very

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
corrugated cardboard was probably very

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.770 
corrugated cardboard was probably very
eco-friendly<00:05:26.220> but<00:05:26.490> more<00:05:27.180> importantly<00:05:27.510> from<00:05:27.630> a

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
eco-friendly but more importantly from a

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.300 
eco-friendly but more importantly from a
packing<00:05:28.110> standpoint<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.650> all<00:05:28.770> just<00:05:28.980> folded

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
packing standpoint it all just folded

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.830 
packing standpoint it all just folded
flat<00:05:29.550> into<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.790> van<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.390> was<00:05:30.480> great<00:05:30.600> for<00:05:30.690> them

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
flat into a van so it was great for them

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.920 
flat into a van so it was great for them
to<00:05:30.990> transport<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.850> for<00:05:32.850> me<00:05:33.000> if<00:05:33.300> I<00:05:33.570> were<00:05:33.720> them

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930

at the end of a show like this I would

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.100 
at the end of a show like this I would
maybe<00:05:35.790> just<00:05:35.940> set<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.570> whole<00:05:36.600> thing<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:36.960> fire
