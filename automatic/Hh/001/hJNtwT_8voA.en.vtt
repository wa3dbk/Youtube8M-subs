means if you are a bass lover you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.020 
means if you are a bass lover you
probably<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.960> love<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.500> headphones

when<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> compare<00:00:57.629> them<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.590> s4<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.609> eyes

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
when I compare them to the s4 two eyes

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
when I compare them to the s4 two eyes
which<00:01:00.329> costs<00:01:00.870> half<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> price<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.949> around

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
which costs half the price at around

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.719 
which costs half the price at around
$100<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.930> guys<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.559> sound<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.159> detailed

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
$100 these guys do sound more detailed

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
$100 these guys do sound more detailed
they<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.330> offer<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.680> tighter<00:01:08.040> bass

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
they do offer a little bit tighter bass

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910 
they do offer a little bit tighter bass
and<00:01:08.820> overall<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.600> sound<00:01:09.960> clearer<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.799> they

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and overall they sound clearer so they

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.149 
and overall they sound clearer so they
are<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.490> better<00:01:11.939> headphone<00:01:12.900> however<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> would

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
are a better headphone however I would

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
are a better headphone however I would
not<00:01:14.189> say<00:01:14.580> they're<00:01:14.760> twice<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
not say they're twice as good as a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
not say they're twice as good as a
step-down<00:01:16.590> model<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.400> where<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> problem

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
step-down model that's where the problem

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
step-down model that's where the problem
I<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.630> terms<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> value

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
I have these in terms of the value

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
I have these in terms of the value
equation<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.850> ear

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
equation there's a lot of in ear

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.230 
equation there's a lot of in ear
headphones<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> 50<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> 150

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
headphones in that kind of 50 to 150

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
headphones in that kind of 50 to 150
dollar<00:01:24.450> price<00:01:24.689> range<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> little

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
dollar price range and this is a little

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.200 
dollar price range and this is a little
bit<00:01:26.340> higher<00:01:26.580> than<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bit higher than that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
bit higher than that
so<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.689> had<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> WoW<00:01:28.200> me<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.950> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you start to demand a little bit more

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.690 
you start to demand a little bit more
from<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.549> earphones<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.189> find

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
them for 50 to $75 less they do tend to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
them for 50 to $75 less they do tend to
go<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.509> price<00:01:48.659> over<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.799> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
go down in price over time these are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
go down in price over time these are
certainly<00:01:50.520> worth<00:01:50.970> considering<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.930> really

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
certainly worth considering I really

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.990 
certainly worth considering I really
like<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> design<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> felt<00:01:53.610> they<00:01:53.700> were<00:01:53.790> really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
like the design I felt they were really
