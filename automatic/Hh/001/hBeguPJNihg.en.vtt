00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
go back to it but you never know and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.819 
go back to it but you never know and
there<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.820> also<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.210> bill<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.869> New<00:01:34.259> York<00:01:34.500> State

there was also a bill in New York State
that<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.369> made<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.670> impossible<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.479> Tesla

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that would made it impossible for Tesla

from<00:02:28.350> third-party<00:02:28.920> dealer<00:02:29.280> lobbyists<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:29.970> i

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
from third-party dealer lobbyists so i

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.310
