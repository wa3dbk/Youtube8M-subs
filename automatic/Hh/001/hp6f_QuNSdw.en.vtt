00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.060
 a very common doubt 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.389
 What is the difference between whitening 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.240
 and laser whitening 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 well firstly i do not like this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 nomenclature home treatment seems 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.300
 Such an impromptu chula thing 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.960
 I'll call the home equipment of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 slow whitening and laser whitening 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.390
 also does not like why the laser does not act 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 in no whitening the laser does not fit 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.180
 for nothing but to attract your 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 attention and here it worked for you 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 was attracted by that name 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.239
 Laser whitening is I'll call 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 loading or a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 whitening done in the office itself 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.610
 well the difference is as follows: 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.940
 difference is that slow loading 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.129
 the product has a low concentration and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 in fast payment the product has a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.809
 much higher concentration and thus 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 he can be faster 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.489
 however it has some disadvantages because it is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.100
 prudent to have a very beautiful appearance 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.650
 it needs to be submerged in the gel 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 bleach for the longest amount of time 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 possible to brighten the surface 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.200
 of the tooth 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.110
 the middle layer and the deepest layer is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 this whitening of the entire tooth 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.810
 which will give it a clearer aspect 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.960
 and more natural while the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.430
 quick brightening you brighten up a lot 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 the outer part and the middle part and the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.070
 deep part I believe not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.159
 I will win so well because this game will 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.860
 penetrate the tooth by osmosis income 2011 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.399
 there are those those example of the second 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 then degree how that by osmosis joel 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 will penetrate deep layers not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 penetrates 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.090
 so I believe that whitening 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.100
 Slowly called a homemade he has a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 better efficiency than training 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.129
 fast but the difference basically this 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.530
 concentration of the substance that is the same 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.569
 substance only changes the concentration of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.590
 including water 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.980
 nothing from another in another solution 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.989
 and leaves him more viscous and the two go 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 work the same way on the tooth 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.749
 For more information, tell me about it. 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.519
 and a half I am at your disposal if you like 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.659
 or I did not like it down here 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.659
 thank you hug
