00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.589
 a parasite 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.660
 However, I have a bit this time 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.090
 designed differently so I have the same 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.390
 shown how to use the products 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 and the way I put it on and that's it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 all done with voiceover and me 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.390
 hope you like it because I 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.040
 Otherwise, the favorites are news 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.350
 always so boring so my opinion 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 and I hope you like that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 like it at the end there are also 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.399
 a very small raffle so 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 really only two things are the but 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.570
 I thought maybe you're glad he was 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.859
 anyway and still participate 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 maybe you is already 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.399
 noticed that the quality one 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 I'm a little bit different 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.820
 Now my new camera is finally that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 the canon eos 600d and i am totally 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.890
 would be really totally okay then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 I just say a lot of fun with the video 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.869
 So you started with already 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.490
 my first favorite and that is it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.619
 this nail polish from Manhattan 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.479
 the color does not fit you so much 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.640
 our season on when it's slow 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 Spring will be but I love the color 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 and he dries within one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 minute 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.829
 which I find very good and I love 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.829
 this nail polish 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.310
 my second favorite is this one 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.830
 hair conditioner you just into the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.450
 hair can spray long hair 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.730
 and therefore sometimes a few problems 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.440
 They are important to get through 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.200
 some of you know that too 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.380
 have long hair and if you look at that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.910
 he can spray the stuff then he can 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.040
 you really get through it much easier 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.750
 brush and they will do it properly 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.100
 that would be cool anyway 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.880
 Try if you have long hair 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.760
 my first favorite is this one 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.040
 camouflage of r and there is him 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.600
 greentube aula and if you put it on the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.780
 wearing skin on then she really has that 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.580
 consistency of pula so very easy and 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.250
 I really like them and then 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.290

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.450

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.440

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.440

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.250
 So they just smell great 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.170
 and if you have dry lips or 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.180

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.650

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 Let us now come to my lifestyle 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.090

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.760

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.250
 just super practical to make up 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.950

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.970
 not always open the drawer 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.310
 be comfortable later and I think sees 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.700
 Firstly, it is awesome and it is very 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.700
 practically 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.170
 this book is my second favorite 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.180

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.360

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.890
 get English 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.810
 So if I'm not sure now 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.790
 but it is true and i love this book 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.560

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.560
 So the story is just great 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.459

 I just love it so you need it 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.510
 milk a banana and vanilla sugar if 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.000
 So you do not want sugar 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.020
 Add if you have the healthier 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.419

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.190
 Shit whether the healthy is well then 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.320
 You have to do a little bit of Europe 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.110
 then make the girls smaller 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.030
 feel want to be the sugar and then 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.410
 just mix everything together and then 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.410
