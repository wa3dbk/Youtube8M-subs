it's<00:01:25.920> discarded<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:28.080> decided<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> use

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it's discarded and we decided to use

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.429 
it's discarded and we decided to use
that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.990> buy<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that so we don't have to go and buy the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.719 
that so we don't have to go and buy the
solar<00:01:31.920> panels<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.240> once<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:35.340> happens

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
solar panels all at once what happens

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
solar panels all at once what happens
here<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.600> air<00:01:36.810> comes<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> pump

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
here is that the air comes from the pump

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.249 
here is that the air comes from the pump
and<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:39.180> drags<00:01:39.600> water<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.189> chute<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
and it drags water up up this chute and

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
and it drags water up up this chute and
this<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.820> inside

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this this is this will be right inside

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.719 
this this is this will be right inside
the<00:01:45.329> IBC<00:01:45.780> tank<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> doesn't<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.460> doesn't

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the IBC tank so it doesn't it doesn't

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.550 
the IBC tank so it doesn't it doesn't
you<00:01:48.119> don't<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> care<00:01:48.840> about<00:01:48.869> leaks<00:01:49.380> or

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you don't have to care about leaks or

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.149 
you don't have to care about leaks or
anything<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> neat<00:01:51.210> thing<00:01:51.600> about<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
anything the neat thing about the the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
anything the neat thing about the the
this<00:01:53.700> type<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.140> pump<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.250> doesn't<00:01:56.610> get

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this type of pump is that it doesn't get

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.690 
this type of pump is that it doesn't get
clogged<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.329> easily<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.579> don't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
clogged very easily and so you you don't

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
clogged very easily and so you you don't
have<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> worry<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.409> filtration<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:02.280> can

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
have to worry about filtration you can

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.910 
have to worry about filtration you can
use<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.759> grow<00:02:03.299> bed<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:04.170> become<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> filter

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
use your grow bed to become the filter

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.020 
use your grow bed to become the filter
and<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> worry<00:02:07.950> about<00:02:08.039> putting

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and you do want to worry about putting

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.050 
and you do want to worry about putting
some<00:02:09.330> type<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.539> net<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.280> won't<00:02:11.520> pull<00:02:11.849> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
some type of net so it won't pull in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.240 
some type of net so it won't pull in
small<00:02:12.390> fish

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
small fish

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.150 
small fish
up<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.730> your<00:02:13.910> grow<00:02:14.240> bed<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.680> carry<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
up to your grow bed it will carry the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.440 
up to your grow bed it will carry the
water<00:02:16.400> up<00:02:16.700> through<00:02:16.730> here

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
water up through here

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.920 
water up through here
this<00:02:18.110> joint<00:02:18.590> right<00:02:18.740> here<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.750> inch

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
this joint right here this is one inch

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.990 
this joint right here this is one inch
by<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> way<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.010> two<00:02:22.460> inch<00:02:22.670> over

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
by the way and this is two inch over

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.100 
by the way and this is two inch over
here<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.930> two<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> one<00:02:25.240> ratio<00:02:26.240> for

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
here so it's like two to one ratio for

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.910 
here so it's like two to one ratio for
it<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.320> work<00:02:27.500> correctly<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.660> right<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:29.990> you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
it to work correctly and right here you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.840 
it to work correctly and right here you
just<00:02:31.550> use<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> these<00:02:32.540> adapters<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.490> and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
just use one of these adapters and and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.170 
just use one of these adapters and and
put<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.709> rubber<00:02:36.709> bushing<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.310> between<00:02:37.670> this

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
put a rubber bushing in between this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.930 
put a rubber bushing in between this
will<00:02:38.390> be<00:02:38.540> right<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.590> between<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.400> grow<00:02:40.640> bed

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
will be right in between the grow bed

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.170 
will be right in between the grow bed
and<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.830> would<00:02:43.280> be<00:02:43.520> down<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and and and this would be down to the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.740 
and and and this would be down to the
fish<00:02:44.450> tank<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:46.340> will<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.790> also<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.330> guard

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
fish tank this will be also your guard

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.580 
fish tank this will be also your guard
to<00:02:48.140> keep<00:02:48.380> your<00:02:48.680> your<00:02:49.520> gravel<00:02:50.300> from<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.500> you

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to keep your your gravel from so you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.050 
to keep your your gravel from so you
could<00:02:51.739> reach<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.390> work<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.600> here<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.820> this<00:02:55.820> is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
could reach and work in here and this is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.590 
could reach and work in here and this is
what<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:56.660> call<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.170> collector<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:58.239> um<00:03:01.600> it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
what we call the collector it um it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.240 
what we call the collector it um it
shoots<00:03:02.959> water<00:03:03.200> through<00:03:03.590> here<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.190> will

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
shoots water through here and it will

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.729 
shoots water through here and it will
just<00:03:04.610> flow<00:03:05.540> into<00:03:05.750> your<00:03:06.050> grow<00:03:06.260> bed<00:03:06.290> right

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
just flow into your grow bed right

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.940 
just flow into your grow bed right
through<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:08.090> would<00:03:08.570> kind<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.530> like<00:03:09.680> be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
through here this would kind of like be

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.030 
through here this would kind of like be
like<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.190> silencer<00:03:10.910> that's<00:03:11.680> another<00:03:12.680> thing

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
like a silencer that's another thing

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.360 
like a silencer that's another thing
that<00:03:13.180> Glen<00:03:14.180> Martinez<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.140> Natalie<00:03:15.530> came<00:03:16.190> up

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
that Glen Martinez and Natalie came up

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.479 
that Glen Martinez and Natalie came up
with<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.470> chamber<00:03:18.860> right<00:03:19.010> here<00:03:19.220> what

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
with and so this chamber right here what

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.070 
with and so this chamber right here what
it<00:03:19.580> does<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.060> collects<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> water<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
it does is it collects the water and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.920 
it does is it collects the water and
just<00:03:21.230> lets<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> flow<00:03:21.860> over<00:03:22.100> here

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
just lets it flow over here

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.530 
just lets it flow over here
the<00:03:24.260> rest<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.519> same<00:03:25.760> type<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.030> stuff<00:03:26.390> that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the rest is the same type of stuff that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.810 
the rest is the same type of stuff that
you<00:03:26.660> see<00:03:26.870> almost<00:03:27.709> everywhere<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.430> bell

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
you see almost everywhere is a bell

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.410 
you see almost everywhere is a bell
siphon<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.920> we're<00:03:31.100> doing<00:03:31.459> differently

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
siphon and what we're doing differently

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.120 
siphon and what we're doing differently
it<00:03:32.540> was<00:03:32.630> you're<00:03:32.810> not<00:03:32.930> using<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.440> bulkhead<00:03:33.799> we're

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it was you're not using a bulkhead we're

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.539 
it was you're not using a bulkhead we're
just<00:03:34.310> using<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.820> adapter<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.830> don't<00:03:37.310> know<00:03:37.370> if<00:03:37.489> I

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
just using the adapter I don't know if I

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.449 
just using the adapter I don't know if I
could<00:03:37.730> twist<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.269> off<00:03:38.570> here<00:03:38.989> but<00:03:40.299> basically

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
could twist this off here but basically

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.940 
could twist this off here but basically
it's<00:03:43.459> uh

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.330 

right<00:03:49.209> we<00:03:50.209> shrink<00:03:50.569> we<00:03:50.959> use<00:03:51.140> heat<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.739> make

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
right we shrink we use heat to make

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.979 
right we shrink we use heat to make
these<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.340> very<00:03:55.700> well<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:59.540> way<00:03:59.780> we

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
these to go in very well and that way we

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.610 
these to go in very well and that way we
avoid<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.620> costly<00:04:01.060> bulkhead<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.959> we<00:04:03.140> just<00:04:03.410> use

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
avoid a costly bulkhead and we just use

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.380 
avoid a costly bulkhead and we just use
a<00:04:03.650> rubber<00:04:04.010> bushing<00:04:04.880> right<00:04:05.180> here<00:04:07.000> that's<00:04:08.000> about

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
a rubber bushing right here that's about

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.410 
a rubber bushing right here that's about
it<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.840> guys<00:04:09.220> hope<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.430> guys<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
it you guys hope you guys like the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.960 
it you guys hope you guys like the
design<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.080> if<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:13.040> does<00:04:13.340> take<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.670> lot<00:04:13.910> of

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
design it if it does take a lot of

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.180 
design it if it does take a lot of
maintenance<00:04:14.330> away<00:04:14.780> from<00:04:15.410> cleaning<00:04:15.680> filters

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
maintenance away from cleaning filters

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.319 
maintenance away from cleaning filters
and<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:18.320> very<00:04:18.650> efficient<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.400> pumps<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.180> lot

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
and it's very efficient it pumps a lot

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.180 
and it's very efficient it pumps a lot
of<00:04:20.479> volume<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.900> water<00:04:21.079> with<00:04:21.440> just<00:04:21.620> very<00:04:21.979> low

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
of volume of water with just very low

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.300 
of volume of water with just very low
wattage<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.790> it's<00:04:23.030> very<00:04:23.810> energy<00:04:24.500> efficient

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
wattage so it's very energy efficient

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.420 
wattage so it's very energy efficient
and<00:04:25.510> it's<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.780> an<00:04:27.050> easy<00:04:27.320> configuration<00:04:28.160> to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and it's it's an easy configuration to

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.150 
and it's it's an easy configuration to
for<00:04:28.850> sustainability<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.990> put<00:04:30.169> a<00:04:30.650> solar

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
for sustainability you just put a solar

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.930 
for sustainability you just put a solar
panel<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.540> battery<00:04:32.750> yes<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.940> that's

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
panel on it and a battery yes and that's

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.430 
panel on it and a battery yes and that's
what<00:04:35.240> we've<00:04:35.389> been<00:04:35.419> doing<00:04:35.810> here<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.320> works

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
what we've been doing here and it works

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.170 
what we've been doing here and it works
really<00:04:36.740> good<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.460> one's<00:04:37.669> going<00:04:37.850> for<00:04:38.150> a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
really good this one's going for a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.900 
really good this one's going for a
school<00:04:38.510> tomorrow<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:41.000> thanks<00:04:41.419> for<00:04:41.540> watching
