00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
style construction which has a silicone

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
style construction which has a silicone

aluminum<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> back<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> let's<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.520> slide

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
aluminum on the back so let's just slide

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 
aluminum on the back so let's just slide
this<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.129> take<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> case

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this out here and take out the case

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
this out here and take out the case
itself<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> only<00:00:39.629> thing<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
itself and the only thing that is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.240 
itself and the only thing that is
included<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.950> packaging<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.030> case

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
included in this packaging is the case

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.740 
included in this packaging is the case
so<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> said<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> hugely<00:00:45.539> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so like I said it does have a hugely on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
so like I said it does have a hugely on
the<00:00:45.840> table<00:00:46.170> design<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> two-piece<00:00:47.370> case

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the table design it is a two-piece case

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
the table design it is a two-piece case
so<00:00:47.850> first<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> silicone<00:00:49.140> layer

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
so first you put on the silicone layer

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.100 
so first you put on the silicone layer
and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.579> plastic<00:00:51.030> layer<00:00:51.210> where<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> two

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and then the plastic layer where the two

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
and then the plastic layer where the two
part<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.770> follow<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.760> we've<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.059> our

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
part will follow so there we've got our

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
part will follow so there we've got our
iPhone<00:00:57.539> 5<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.410> gonna<00:00:58.620> figure<00:00:58.859> out

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
iPhone 5 here I'm just gonna figure out

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 
iPhone 5 here I'm just gonna figure out
how<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.609> apart<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.539> some

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
how to take this apart I did have some

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.039 
how to take this apart I did have some
problems<00:01:01.350> trying<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.010> case<00:01:02.250> apart

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
problems trying to get this case apart

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.830 
problems trying to get this case apart
so<00:01:04.049> there<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.260> snap<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.949> apart<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.840> we

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so there just snap it apart there and we

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.350 
so there just snap it apart there and we
revealed<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> silicone<00:01:08.460> part<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
revealed with the silicone part of the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.899 
revealed with the silicone part of the
case<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.400> need<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> take<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
case so now you just need to take the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
case so now you just need to take the
iPhone<00:01:12.060> 5<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> put<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> silicone<00:01:13.799> case

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
iPhone 5 and put it in the silicone case

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.109 
iPhone 5 and put it in the silicone case
this<00:01:14.220> part<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.850> pretty

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this part it's actually pretty

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:15.830 
this part it's actually pretty
straightforward

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
straightforward

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480 
straightforward
and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.619> time<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> plastic

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and then it's time to put in the plastic

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
and then it's time to put in the plastic
part<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> did<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.750> bit<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
part which I did have a little bit of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050 
part which I did have a little bit of
troubles<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.530> may<00:01:19.710> explain<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.250> sped<00:01:20.939> this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
troubles which may explain I sped this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
troubles which may explain I sped this
up<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.860> hard<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> line<00:01:23.520> up

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
up here but just really hard to line up

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
up here but just really hard to line up
actually<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.240> snap<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.049> but

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
actually and just snap it on there but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
actually and just snap it on there but
overall<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.220> able<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
overall you're able to get it on and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
overall you're able to get it on and
there<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> pretty<00:01:28.259> nice<00:01:28.710> case<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
there you go it's a pretty nice case in

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520 
there you go it's a pretty nice case in
terms<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.790> its<00:01:29.939> protection<00:01:30.329> wise<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.290> see

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
terms of its protection wise I can see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
terms of its protection wise I can see
why<00:01:31.650> people<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
why people would use this because it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.359 
why people would use this because it
does<00:01:33.000> offer<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.450> quite<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> bit<00:01:33.930> style<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.920> well

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
does offer a quite a bit style as well

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
does offer a quite a bit style as well
as<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> protection<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.150> also<00:01:36.270> gives<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
as a protection it also gives and as you

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
as a protection it also gives and as you
can<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> camera<00:01:37.979> room<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.310> also<00:01:38.490> rimmed

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
can see the camera room is also rimmed

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
can see the camera room is also rimmed
so<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.869> won't<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.439> any<00:01:40.500> glare<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.250> taking

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so you won't have any glare when taking

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
so you won't have any glare when taking
photos<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.869> terms<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> thickness<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
photos in terms of the thickness it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
photos in terms of the thickness it
isn't<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> thinnest<00:01:45.149> case<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.540> there

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
isn't really the thinnest case out there

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
isn't really the thinnest case out there
but<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.470> intended<00:01:46.770> toward<00:01:47.159> someone

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but this is more intended toward someone

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.889 
but this is more intended toward someone
who<00:01:47.640> wants<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.360> good<00:01:48.540> level<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
who wants a really good level of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.910 
who wants a really good level of
protection<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> top<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
protection and on the top just take a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
protection and on the top just take a
look<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.640> volume<00:01:54.000> rockers<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.930> power

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
look at the volume rockers and the power

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.600 
look at the volume rockers and the power
button<00:01:55.439> which<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.710> nicely<00:01:55.890> exposed<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
button which are nicely exposed as a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
button which are nicely exposed as a
silicone<00:01:57.090> meaning<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> it'll<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:57.960> easy

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
silicone meaning that it'll be very easy

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
silicone meaning that it'll be very easy
to<00:01:58.619> access<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> shouldn't<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.610> any<00:01:59.820> issues

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to access you shouldn't have any issues

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.920 
to access you shouldn't have any issues
with<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:01.880> now<00:02:02.880> taking<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.329> look<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
with that now taking a look at the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
with that now taking a look at the
bottom<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.590> does<00:02:04.979> seem<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.670> recessed<00:02:06.149> as

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
bottom it does seem kind of recessed as

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
bottom it does seem kind of recessed as
you<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.500> does<00:02:07.710> give<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> quite<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.220> bit

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you know this does give you quite a bit

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
you know this does give you quite a bit
of<00:02:08.459> protection<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> two

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of protection because this is a two

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
of protection because this is a two
layer<00:02:10.050> hybrid<00:02:10.500> case<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.340> does<00:02:11.489> seem<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
layer hybrid case so it does seem a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.160 
layer hybrid case so it does seem a
little<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.090> deep<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.629> still<00:02:12.930> should

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
little bit deep but you still should

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.750 
little bit deep but you still should
have<00:02:13.349> any<00:02:13.500> problems<00:02:13.890> getting<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.400> ports

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
have any problems getting your ports

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.339 
have any problems getting your ports
your<00:02:15.030> lighting<00:02:15.450> dock<00:02:15.599> connector<00:02:15.990> or<00:02:16.230> your

very nice brushed aluminum look as you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.089 
very nice brushed aluminum look as you
know<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.360> did<00:02:21.720> review<00:02:22.500> another<00:02:22.650> case<00:02:22.980> from

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
know I did review another case from

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.589 
know I did review another case from
seller<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.700> also<00:02:24.000> had<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> very<00:02:24.420> nice

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
seller which also had a very nice

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.750 
seller which also had a very nice
brushed<00:02:24.930> aluminum<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:26.220> seems<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.489> be<00:02:26.550> their

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
brushed aluminum so it seems to be their

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
brushed aluminum so it seems to be their
specialty<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.300> really<00:02:27.690> enjoy<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
specialty I really enjoy it and on the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
specialty I really enjoy it and on the
front<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.610> said<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> gives<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> huge

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
front like I said it gives you a huge

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.510 
front like I said it gives you a huge
lay<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.140> table<00:02:31.260> design<00:02:31.560> probably<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.489> a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
lay on the table design probably like a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.640 
lay on the table design probably like a
one<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.030> half<00:02:33.060> millimeter<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:34.350> two

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
one and a half millimeter or two

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.710 
one and a half millimeter or two
millimeter<00:02:35.130> lay<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> table<00:02:35.970> design<00:02:36.209> there

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
millimeter lay on the table design there

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
millimeter lay on the table design there
so<00:02:36.959> that's<00:02:37.170> also<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.590> plus<00:02:37.800> if<00:02:38.010> you're<00:02:38.130> gonna<00:02:38.220> be

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
so that's also a plus if you're gonna be

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
so that's also a plus if you're gonna be
dropping<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:39.000> face<00:02:39.660> flat<00:02:39.900> concrete<00:02:40.200> or

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
dropping it on face flat concrete or

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.050 
dropping it on face flat concrete or
something<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:40.980> great<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.550> because<00:02:41.880> as

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
something it's great to have because as

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.610 
something it's great to have because as
you<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.690> cases<00:02:43.019> do<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> little

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you know a lot of cases do a little

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890 
you know a lot of cases do a little
table<00:02:43.950> design<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.030> still<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> risk

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
table design but you still have the risk

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.990 
table design but you still have the risk
of<00:02:46.170> damaging<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:46.769> screen<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.730> case

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
of damaging your screen but in this case

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940 
of damaging your screen but in this case
I'd<00:02:48.600> say<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.050> kind<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.319> like<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> stylish

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
I'd say this is kind of like a stylish

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680 
I'd say this is kind of like a stylish
