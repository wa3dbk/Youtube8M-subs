then you're going to take your bandage
and<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.910> started<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:40.069> couple<00:02:41.069> fingers<00:02:41.250> down<00:02:41.610> from

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
and I started a couple fingers down from

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:54.970 
and I started a couple fingers down from
the<00:02:41.940> top<00:02:44.629> again<00:02:45.629> I<00:02:45.660> keep<00:02:45.989> consistent<00:02:46.950> pressure

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.839 

overlapping<00:02:56.180> about<00:02:57.180> half<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.580> judge

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
overlapping about half and you can judge

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.229 
overlapping about half and you can judge
that<00:02:59.879> depending<00:03:00.629> on<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:02.430> bandage<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> how

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that depending on the bandage and how

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.699 
that depending on the bandage and how
much<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.569> have<00:03:03.599> left<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.200> hand<00:03:04.500> you'll

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
much you have left in your hand you'll

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.180 
much you have left in your hand you'll
get<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> feel<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.700> more<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.209> it

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.800 

then<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.310> take<00:03:11.519> your<00:03:11.549> roll<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.880> saran<00:03:12.329> wrap<00:03:12.599> or

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
then you take your roll of saran wrap or

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.250 
then you take your roll of saran wrap or
cling<00:03:12.989> wrap<00:03:15.980> again<00:03:16.980> start<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.640> inside<00:03:21.260> now

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.400 
could put undue pressure on your horse's
tendons<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.079> ligaments<00:03:45.019> then<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.170> take<00:03:46.380> your

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
tendons and ligaments then you take your

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.000 
tendons and ligaments then you take your
electrical<00:03:47.100> tape<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.930> usually<00:03:49.319> put<00:03:49.590> one

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
electrical tape and I usually put one

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.620 
electrical tape and I usually put one
strand<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.700> weight<00:03:50.880> over<00:03:51.299> where<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
strand of it weight over where the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.680 
strand of it weight over where the
velcro<00:03:51.840> goes<00:03:52.549> make<00:03:53.549> sure<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.940> do<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.329> loose

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
velcro goes make sure you do this loose

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.780 
velcro goes make sure you do this loose
there<00:03:55.019> should<00:03:55.230> not<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.440> any<00:03:55.829> pressure<00:03:56.250> on<00:03:56.430> this

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
there should not be any pressure on this

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.940 
there should not be any pressure on this
because<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.870> would<00:03:58.019> cause<00:03:58.200> pressure<00:03:58.530> high

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
because that would cause pressure high

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.920 
because that would cause pressure high
on<00:03:59.130> your<00:03:59.310> horse's<00:03:59.670> tendons<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.720> could
