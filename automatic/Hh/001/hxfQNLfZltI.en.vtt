 hello everyone is steven and like you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.300
 may have noticed a lot of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.099
 little news from ios is are drawn 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 the jailbreak so not all well 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.430
 obviously but we still have not 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.660
 badly like that and that's why in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.250
 this new video I'm going to you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 explain how to see what's new 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.490
 of ios is sinks and 6 so thanks to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.590
 jailbreak and cydia tweaks the most 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 obvious and we'll start with that it's 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 the appearance so you necessarily had it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.020
 noticed during the first videos of 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.910
 ios presentation is the design a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 totally changed starting with the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.840
 application icons or even 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 inside the application interface 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.290
 is totally different soy and 7 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 well all that you will be able 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 to have it seals and if this case 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 exactly the same thing but everything 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.449
 you will need it winterboard 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 the well- known themes installer and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.000
 a theme that you can find 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.370
 free on cydia 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 it's called simply ios seven 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 themes and it will allow you to have 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.910
 menus that are very similar to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.860
 those of a bone is and you've seen it too 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 the same icons on the springboard 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 we see what it gives left my 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 iphone 5 under ios is and right my 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.920
 other iphone 5 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920
 soyaux and 6 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 second novelty of ayo and 7 which you 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.430
 will be able to arrange soyaux and 6 thanks 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.409
 at the jailbreak 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 these are these animations you'll find at 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.009
 the opening and closing of 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 applications you want at each 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 times the screen are closed like 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 sucked up to the app icon 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.150
 so I do not really know how you 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.189
 describe this effect you see it very 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.570
 well on the screen right now and you have 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.930
 the possibility of reproducing it thanks 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
 to the tweak cydia display candy the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 now famous brand new 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 ios multitasking is is absolutely 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.320
 not breathe windows phone like 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.479
 many might think so but he 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 also he comes from the jailbreak and more 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 especially of a cydia tweak that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 is called card sweatshirt and you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.640
 can see working on my iphone 5 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.000
 jailbreak and soyaux and 6 right of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.950
 the screen 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.229
 so it's exactly the same interface 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
 that ios multitasking is you do 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 scroll right apps to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 left and wanted to close them by slipping 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 finger up if you want 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.489
 so the same multitasking departs witcher 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.340
 you need another small 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.569
 novelty of ios is now 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.610
 so you're going to see it this one is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.810
 much more discreet you really have to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.370
 know she's here to find her on 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.140
 can even fall on it without doing 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.700
 purposely so it's a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.170
 function that lets you slide to 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.819
 the left with your finger when you 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.769
 are in a menu to move to that 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.660
 preceding watching I slide towards the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.190
 left and I go back so that 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.209
 avoids pressing the back button which 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.680
 is at the top of the screen at each 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.500
 time it can go faster 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.569
 and it's super convenient very intuitive 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 it's extremely fluid as well 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.530
 soyaux and 7 k -o and 6 where you go 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.720
 can find this function on 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.630
 iphone ipod touch and ipad thanks to a 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.430
 cydia tweak called swype yes he 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 is free and it works pretty much 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.269
 everywhere in the settings in the app 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.739
 store also is pretty much in all 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.599
 menus you will need to go back in 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.150
 back so an extremely tweak 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.310
 practical and very well done you'll get it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.319
 necessarily noticed soyal s is the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.480
 notifications center has totally 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.489
 been done again that's what it gives and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.829
 among these novelties we find this blur 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.629
 in the background that will blur your icons 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.400
 and the content of your applications 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.530
 so if this feature do you and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.150
 set you are interested thanks to the jailbreak 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.940
 again you can find it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.519
 soyaux and 6 the tweak is called blurred 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.489
 ensi background and web what it gives 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.079

 notifications center will be 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.549
 transparent is blurred then always 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.829
 concerning the notification center 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.569
 and here we touch one of the big 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.220
 ios news is this is the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.540
 possibility of having direct access 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.069
 from the lock screen 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.109
 so much to tell you that it's 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.700
 extremely convenient to view these 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.829
 notifications or the marks is 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.269
 known and well this center of 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.370
 lockscreen notifications 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.230
 you can access it from ayo and 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.299
 6 thanks to the tweak cydia called 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.970
 newsletter that you can find on 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.290
 cydia and that is super well done a 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.910
 tweak cydia who should now 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.639
 really interest you if you are 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.560
 stayed under ios 6 look what it's like to me 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.989
 gives an almost exact replica of the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.030
 ayo control center and may 7 the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.910
 jelly thanks to the cydia loghbar pro tweak 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.799
 will be iphone 5 jailbreak and soyaux and 6 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.750
 so that's what I have the shortcuts 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.030
 for system settings the control of 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.519
 the brightness of the music and the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.450
 four shortcuts for the torch 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.340
 the clock application of the calculator 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.670
 and the camera all that accessible 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.400
 sliding from the bottom to the top 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.960
 from your lock screen 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.670
 to finish with the lockscreen you 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.870
 can define an active action wrongly 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.010
 which will allow you to unlock 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.180
 from anywhere like on ios is 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.230
 it's a small detail but it can 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.080
 always be nice to see 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.310
 the tweak cydia safari ue nor beard goes 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.090
 allow you to have a bar of 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.080
 unified search on mobile safari 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.910
 always in the little details the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.400
 tweak cydia life clock will allow you 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.080
 to have an animated clock like that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.750
 ios is with the moving second hand 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.520
 real time then 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.750
 there we go to one of the novelties of ios 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.030
 is that I prefer that I find 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.400
 really very useful is the possibility 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.160
 to block a contact from blocking a 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.390
 number if it harasses you or if 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.380
 you simply do not want to 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.210
 to hear from him 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.890
 you block it and well this 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.960
 feature one more time you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.730
 can see her soy and 6 if you are 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.140
 jailbroken you settle 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.750
 the app called haye 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.610
 free blacklist on cydia is a 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.930
 titan deaths and then it will take the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.240
 pay if you want to use version 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.190
 complete but it will make you exactly 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.620
 the same thing the possibility of creating 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.020
 a blacklist to contact you is 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.060
 blocked if you feel like it 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.060
 I end with the parallax effect of ayo 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.470
 so is it was a kind of 3d 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.790
 behind the icons and your background 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.310
 when you move your 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.020
 smartphone you can see it under ios 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.270
 6 thanks to cydia tweaks called 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.310
 deep end where I tell you it's 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.080
 exactly but the facts it's 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.390
 rather spectacular even if it's eating 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.410
 a lot of drums I get you so 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.070
 if you're interested you can 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.920
 install 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.960
 it's deep end so that's for the 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.430
 interesting features of the bones 7 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.200
 and for which I find a 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.360
 equivalent soyaux and 6 thanks to 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.100
 jailbreak is so thanks to a tweak 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.870
 cydia to allow you on your 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.970
 iphone your ipod touch or your ipad 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.560
 jailbroken to dispose of his 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.980
 ios features is if it's you 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.690
 interested 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.300
 without updating 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.160
 so remained soyal and 6 to enjoy 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.230
 of your jailbreak I think that's 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.490
 can really interest you 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.410
 you do not necessarily have to 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.250
 install everything you simply install 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.410

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.210
 which I did not think of well 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.500
 do not hesitate to say that it will benefit 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.690
