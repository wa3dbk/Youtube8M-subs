00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Do you know this problem when in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.140
 their playstation does not matter for example 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:15.929
 play a game here and it happens 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:17.430
 just do not listen to the playstation 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 work but ultimately starts 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 nothing neither play nor dvd nor music 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.570
 still blu rays i show you in that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.490
 video now like him most cost effective 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:35.700
 a repair attempt states completely without 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.800
 spend a lot of money where with the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.910
 we need to be able to start repair 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 a little bit of alcohol best 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.559
 Alcohol what you get in the pharmacy 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.829
 if it does not exist 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.620
 you can also like vodka or stop 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.110
 take high percentage of alcohol 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.890
 Alcohol would also be a possibility 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.309
 In addition, would not be bad 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.170
 yes to get a joke 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.399
 that you can screw without any 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 damages on 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.490
 of course the version for the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 bit and for cleaning the laser is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.680
 just plain cotton swabs 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.500
 In addition, we also need one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 Sheet of paper around excess alcohol 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.930
 then I would say start 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.590
 We'll be there with the opening of the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590
 playstation 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.850
 at this assurance one recognizes that the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.500
 playstation is still unopened under 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 this backup is also the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.990
 screw that we have to solve and that 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.800
 to open top part 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.540
 ultimately, I can prove it 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.450
 that the playstation never open 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.640
 had and I'm really curious how that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.750
 result of this repair 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.590
 will fail 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.510
 So, as I said this fuse stuck 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.290
 over the screw and we have to 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.290
 solve it first 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.619
 so you can see it with it playstation 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.050
 So sony can recognize it 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.050
 that the original was locked 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:31.770
 next we have to do this here 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:32.190
 cork out team now only out 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.640
 pull 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.760
 Here is the closure in this 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.320
 hole plugged yes one in the bus I screw 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 look shortly after which with post 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:07.150
 that would have to fit 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.890
 For this I will solve the screw 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.470
 so now you have to open the screw 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.450
 and now we will be the lid 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.640
 to open 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.640
 For that you simply see him to the side 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:32.959
 so seen to the left from the front and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.770
 then open the lid I put 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.770
 now briefly to the side 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.450
 now we have worked up to 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.640
 to the content skin that will turn too 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.850
 secured with four screws 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.920
 At the corners here is one here 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.209
 one could be a relationship here 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.750
 theoretically all screws 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.220
 In total, six pieces are the ones to solve 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.850
 Complete the complete lid 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.910
 hold on that I open now I open 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.910
 the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.180
 and sometimes you have to pay attention is one 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.370
 when assembling again there is one 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.380
 long and a short screw so it 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.810
 are several long and several short 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.040
 screw it and it is very important that 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.630
 one does not exchange that report 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.250
 Do not be long in a short healthy 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.190
 push that makes you break more 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.950
 that you actually repaired and thus 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.470
 we know where the short is heard 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.570
 on the case in case with an ass it 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.610
 stands for short accordingly 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.130
 then later the short shower in the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.640
 logbook at bms and the long in the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.420
 remaining total I can now here 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.160
 realize that if it does not work for me 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.010
 only a short screw is deceiving 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.170
 the rest is actually there 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.320
 the same amount of time 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.640
 now we have solved all the screws 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.380
 Some are already stuck out some 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.000
 that's not important now 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.780
 Now you just want the alarm clock 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.450
 lift down 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.300
 we have to pay attention to that because there are so 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.730
 seen small clips one with the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.300
 finger must press so that the housing 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.910
 rises 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.730
 it is a kind of assurance 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.430
 Do not assemble the playstation 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.000
 falls apart and then continue 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.720
 be careful 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.830
 because we want nothing granted 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.940
 still on the housing still s.der drive 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.910
 the inner life also do not want 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.500
 We are exactly right and we have that 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.140
 already achieved what we achieve 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.650
 wanted to 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.210
 Now we have made the way 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.450
 now we can all screw 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:55.780
 get out before one gets lost 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:06:00.099
 there is one left and then one left 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:03.440
 again the plate on the side 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.449
 and there we are better again 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.569
 we will now recognize where that 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:12.349
 biggest problem is because if that 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:15.440
 the playstation works long recognizes 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:17.870
 it is quite good if dust is included 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.400
 speak the laser as a drive can even 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.080
 no longer be cooled because everything with 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.509
 pores is clogged 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:35.560
 to recognize it better so easy me 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:35.560
 you recognize it so it's all dust 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:47.409
 and and most important the laser of 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:52.659
 dust to be freed to now on the ball 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:56.599
 which is actually only it put so 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:58.669
 well, before I forget that one 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.780
 recognize what you have to stake out here 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.780
 this little cable
