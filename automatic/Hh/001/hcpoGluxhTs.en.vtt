00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
you can see the whole way around it has

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.739 
you can see the whole way around it has
a<00:00:59.170> lot<00:00:59.469> of<00:00:59.499> a<00:00:59.649> smaller<00:01:00.010> cut<00:01:00.460> case<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.359> compared

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
a lot of a smaller cut case so compared

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.899 
a lot of a smaller cut case so compared
to<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.019> Jumbo<00:01:02.499> one<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.979> don't<00:01:03.339> have<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.699> zoom

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
to the Jumbo one I don't have to zoom

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.550 
to the Jumbo one I don't have to zoom
out<00:01:04.120> as<00:01:04.300> much<00:01:04.510> but<00:01:04.839> as<00:01:04.870> you<00:01:05.019> can<00:01:05.140> see<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
out as much but as you can see the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.920 
out as much but as you can see the
detail<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.220> smaller<00:01:06.520> pack<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.300> tends<00:01:07.750> to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
detail on the smaller pack is tends to

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.410 
detail on the smaller pack is tends to
be<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> lot<00:01:08.380> more<00:01:08.790> clearer<00:01:09.790> as<00:01:10.120> it's<00:01:10.300> got

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
be a lot more clearer as it's got

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.179 
be a lot more clearer as it's got
smaller<00:01:10.780> sits<00:01:11.079> bit<00:01:11.320> more<00:01:11.469> easier<00:01:11.829> for<00:01:11.890> them<00:01:12.159> to

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
smaller sits bit more easier for them to

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.459 
smaller sits bit more easier for them to
print<00:01:12.579> on<00:01:12.820> as<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.780> can<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:14.049> I've<00:01:14.170> just<00:01:14.350> chosen

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
give a review of it but as you can see

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.889 
give a review of it but as you can see
it's<00:01:18.009> bit<00:01:18.130> more<00:01:18.310> smaller<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.360> has<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.540> seal

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
it's bit more smaller and it has a seal

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.230 
it's bit more smaller and it has a seal
on<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.200> poker<00:01:20.439> size<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.979> here<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.850> can<00:01:22.000> see

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
on the poker size one here you can see

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.709 
on the poker size one here you can see
that<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> small<00:01:22.780> ones<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.200> ranges<00:01:23.950> from<00:01:24.539> I<00:01:25.539> can

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
that the small ones it ranges from I can

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.469 
that the small ones it ranges from I can
give<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.289> size<00:01:26.530> exactly<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.700> usually<00:01:28.270> is

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
give you the size exactly it usually is

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.100 
give you the size exactly it usually is
about<00:01:29.610> nine<00:01:30.610> centimeters<00:01:31.360> in<00:01:31.509> height<00:01:31.539> and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
about nine centimeters in height and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.359 
about nine centimeters in height and
compared<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.250> Jumbo<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:35.369> 14

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
compared to the Jumbo it is 14

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.310 
compared to the Jumbo it is 14
centimeters<00:01:36.909> in<00:01:36.969> height<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.659> just<00:01:37.869> 5<00:01:38.109> more

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
centimeters in height so just 5 more

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.830 
centimeters in height so just 5 more
centimeters<00:01:38.890> but<00:01:39.039> this<00:01:39.490> one<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:40.180> be<00:01:40.210> big

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
centimeters but this one can be big

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.539 
centimeters but this one can be big
enough<00:01:41.109> because<00:01:41.619> there's<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.100> bridge<00:01:42.310> size

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
enough because there's a bridge size

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.609 
enough because there's a bridge size
deck<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.090> most<00:01:43.450> people<00:01:43.750> prefer<00:01:43.869> those<00:01:44.320> if

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
deck and most people prefer those if

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.499 
deck and most people prefer those if
you're<00:01:44.859> getting<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.250> Stein<00:01:45.460> into<00:01:45.700> magic<00:01:46.030> but

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
you're getting in Stein into magic but

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're getting in Stein into magic but
this<00:01:46.689> one<00:01:46.899> here<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.409> can<00:01:48.159> get<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.369> plastic

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
this one here and you can get in plastic

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.060 
this one here and you can get in plastic
coated<00:01:49.180> with<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.509> Jumbo<00:01:49.899> index<00:01:50.289> once<00:01:50.590> it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
coated with the Jumbo index once it

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.399 
coated with the Jumbo index once it
tends<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:52.000> quite<00:01:52.420> there<00:01:52.840> was<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> that

tends to be quite there was a that
there's<00:01:53.649> not<00:01:53.740> really<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.979> good<00:01:54.250> stock<00:01:54.609> it<00:01:54.909> tends

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
there's not really a good stock it tends

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.749 
there's not really a good stock it tends
to<00:01:55.210> be<00:01:55.329> really<00:01:55.659> really<00:01:55.869> thin<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.549> could

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
to be really really thin and that could

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.090 
to be really really thin and that could
be<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> problem<00:01:58.119> for<00:01:58.420> some<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.920> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
bicycles as you can see the back design

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080 
bicycles as you can see the back design
seems<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:13.890> little<00:04:13.950> bit<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.459> rubbish<00:04:14.850> we've

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
seems a little bit of rubbish we've

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.580 
seems a little bit of rubbish we've
Jumbo<00:04:15.450> indexed<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:15.930> tend<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.169> be<00:04:16.289> just<00:04:16.440> quite

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
Jumbo indexed they tend to be just quite

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.289 
Jumbo indexed they tend to be just quite
rubbish<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.000> can<00:04:18.090> see<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
rubbish and as you can see on the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.789 
rubbish and as you can see on the
smaller<00:04:18.539> card<00:04:18.750> it's<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.079> artwork<00:04:19.440> and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
smaller card it's a bit more artwork and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.319 
smaller card it's a bit more artwork and
a<00:04:20.010> bit<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.280> designers<00:04:20.789> put<00:04:20.970> into<00:04:21.180> because

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
a bit more designers put into because

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.450 
a bit more designers put into because
it's<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> smaller<00:04:21.750> canvas<00:04:22.229> this<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.890> bigger<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
it just doesn't look very

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.330 
it just doesn't look very
nice<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.050> usually<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.770> has<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:25.950> big<00:04:26.130> thick

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
nice and usually it has a big thick

thick either as you can tell that the
poke<00:04:35.640> size<00:04:35.940> is<00:04:36.240> thicker<00:04:36.480> this<00:04:36.720> feels<00:04:36.990> like

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
poke size is thicker this feels like

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.280 
poke size is thicker this feels like
just<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:37.530> layer<00:04:38.060> now<00:04:39.060> enough<00:04:39.840> about<00:04:39.870> the

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
just one layer now enough about the

just one layer now enough about the
complaining<00:04:40.740> on<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.920> Jumbo<00:04:41.280> index<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.850> was

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
complaining on the Jumbo index it was

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.060 
complaining on the Jumbo index it was
just<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> bit<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.270> fun<00:04:42.360> there<00:04:42.720> now<00:04:43.290> let's<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
look at the handling for both these days

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.120 
look at the handling for both these days
so<00:04:46.050> let's<00:04:46.200> have<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.320> look<00:04:46.470> at<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.620> poker<00:04:46.800> sites

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
so let's have a look at the poker sites

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.040 
so let's have a look at the poker sites
first<00:04:47.430> okay<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.030> I'm<00:04:48.390> gonna<00:04:48.540> start<00:04:48.840> with<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
first okay so I'm gonna start with the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.500 
first okay so I'm gonna start with the
Jumbo<00:04:49.410> index<00:04:49.800> first<00:04:50.160> as<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:51.030> can<00:04:51.180> see<00:04:51.360> for

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
Jumbo index first as you can see for

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.600 
Jumbo index first as you can see for
handling<00:04:51.960> when<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.140> do<00:04:52.350> spread<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.280> bit

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
handling when you do spread it's a bit

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.760 
handling when you do spread it's a bit
of<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.820> problem<00:04:54.090> as<00:04:54.390> you<00:04:54.480> can<00:04:54.630> see<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:55.260> can<00:04:55.470> do
