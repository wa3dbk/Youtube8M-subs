00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.910
 let's prepare dragon eggs 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.309
 special halloween the ingredients that 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.339
 we need are as many eggs as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.219
 we want to know colorants that serve 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:19.410
 in liquid gel or the kind of dye 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:23.050
 that we have and water and we're going to start 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.540
 taking a saucepan and a little coloring 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.270
 yellow and we're going to dye the water a little 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.030
 of cooking this will make you like the egg 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.820
 it is porous it absorbs a tinge of color and 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.399
 is as the basis of our egg and the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.559
 put to cook in the saucepan from 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.350
 cold water as they were in the fridge 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.999
 we do not want crystal in zizur if 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.999
 travel in the uar bill and the 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.309
 we will put directly from the refrigerator the 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.769
 sudden temperature change would make 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.129
 they broke and all the egg came out 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.100
 for water that's why we do it that way and 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.039
 while we are going to prepare three glasses with 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.719
 three different coloring colors 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.670
 do not worry if you spend with the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.309
 coloring, the more the chemo is 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 more intense will be 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.009
 once they started sewing and we counted 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.799
 about 10 or 12 minutes depending on what 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.350
 cold that was the egg we separated it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.500
 of the fire and we took it out quickly and the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.259
 we dry on kitchen paper we dry 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.530
 well be very careful not to burn 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 they are burning and with the back of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 a spoon we help ourselves and we hit them 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.470
 well everywhere to break them 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.470
 but without the shell falling off 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.960
 then we will put them each in the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.189
 water of a color in this case we have 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.439
 made one blue one red and one green and 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.070
 We are going to leave them resting in the fridge 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.020
 two hours before peeling once 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 After a while we prepare a little bit 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 over kitchen paper 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.190
 and we drain them 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.190
 especially not to get lost 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.230
 and we are going to peel them 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.230
 with a lot of patient care 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.860
 to discover what we have achieved 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.890
 a dragon egg 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.840
 You see what a pimp we can think of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 that this idea is great to do 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.310
 some stuffed halloween eggs 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.950
 sure great that the kids 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.560
 love it well we can prepare any 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.810
 type of filling quickie with sticks 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.200
 mayonnaise crab and chub for 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.750
 fill them out or we can present them like this or 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 as we want we give the idea and 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.150
 you already use it for whatever you want 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.030
 and remember that we already have a community 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.490
 in google + where you can upload the photos 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.680
 of your creations that we love 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.050
 see why we are convinced that a 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.050
 we are all delicious
