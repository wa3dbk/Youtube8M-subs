00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.820
We are with the Peugeot 508.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.380
The 508, the D class sedan of the Peugeot, had a facelift and attained a more attention-grabbing outlook.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 Let’s see if the 508 became arbiter as a competitor after the renewals?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.580
Let’s analyze it together.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.060
The Peugeot 508 appears to be more dynamic and prestigious after the facelift.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.340
The lion logo taken from the bonnet and placed to the center of the grill and the Peugeot caption reflects the new brand identity.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.220
The new headlamps with full LED are the indication the 508’s progress in the field of technology.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.340
The 508 with 2817 mm axle span is one up on its rivals.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.240
The new taillights and new design rear bumper are the main renewals at the rear of the 508.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:04.260
The boot of the 508 opens by pressing into the center of the zero as previously and the 473-liter loading capacity is the average value of this class.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.020
The interior of the Peugeot 508 was not privileged from the facelift.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.660
There is no appreciable difference here. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.760
In the cockpit, furnished with high quality materials, the layout of the buttons is good and easy to reach.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.460
But it is hard to say the same for the covered cubicles for small items.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.760
Because there is only one small covered cubicle here underhand and a smallish armrest.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.920
In addition, the cup holders come out of the front console and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.120
when you try to put something like water bottle it obscures the multimedia screen to a large extend.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.680
I think this is a big shortcoming.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.460
As a result I should say that the outlook of the cockpit is high-toned but it is weak in practicality.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.640
To start the engine and to lower the hand brake you are obliged to press the buttons on the left side of the steering wheel

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.720
and this at the beginning really goes quite counter to the customs.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.440
The living space offered at the rear is quite good.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.000
Here, a knee room that will accommodate adults easily is offered.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400
The headroom is also not too bad.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.920
Since there is no transmission tunnel and due to this hollowness the third adult can sit here without difficulty.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.560
Besides, to have a special A/C buttons at the rear is also an important advantage.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.460
Let us consider the engine and the driving features of the 508.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:40.100
The 508 is imported to our country with 3 different engine alternatives such as 1.6-liter diesel, 2.0-liter diesel and 1.6-liter petrol.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.460
In the 508 that I have been driving 1.6-liter turbo charged petrol engine is functioning.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.160
You can only purchase this engine, which develops 165 HP and 240 Nm of torque with 6-speed automatic gearbox.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.480
The power of this engine is good and it performs very well.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.620
Although the 508 is a 1.4 tons sedan the engine with its lively structure carries this body easily and I think it deserves praise.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.540
The harmony of the gearbox that possesses fast changes, with the engine to me is also a plus.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.340
You are able to change the gears from the gear lever as well as from the pedals behind the steering wheel manually.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.340
The construction of the suspensions is set to offer comfort and dynamism together.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.440
In general you can achieve comfortable driving with the 508

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.620
but when the surface of the roads are rough the suspension comfort decreases and it works noisily.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.800
In the matter of road handling the 508 has an attitude of its class standards.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.740
If you do not force the limits, it definitely does not step out of line.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.080
Steering responses, although not very fast, are good enough to satisfy the expectations.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.180
Let us come to the fuel consumption subject of the 508.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:06.940
I have been driving this car for a week and have covered 300 km at the moment the trip computer indicates 9,6-liter fuel consumption averages.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.340
Although it seems high at first glance, when you consider the size of the 508

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.160
and the 165 HP of the engine and the performance it offers, the value then is not bad.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.340
The renewed 508 with high-toned cockpit and modern appearance, tries to grab attention in this class

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.400
where ruthless competition is experienced and in my opinion achieve it.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.140
