size<00:02:21.030> which<00:02:21.599> that's<00:02:21.930> interesting<00:02:22.470> make<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.280> a

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
size which that's interesting make it a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.059 
size which that's interesting make it a
little<00:02:23.400> bit<00:02:23.610> more<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.650> way<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
little bit more out of the way so you

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.330 
little bit more out of the way so you
won't<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.520> worry<00:02:26.700> about<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:28.340> local

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
won't have to worry about it local

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640 
won't have to worry about it local
server<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.940> maybe<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:31.050> know<00:02:31.080> people<00:02:31.470> have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
server like maybe you know people have

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.340

problems<00:02:32.270> hitting<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.540> smaller<00:02:33.810> size<00:02:34.080> they

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
problems hitting the smaller size they

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.840 
problems hitting the smaller size they
can<00:02:34.500> make<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> bigger<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.280> would<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.489> handy

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
can make it bigger that would be handy

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.479 
can make it bigger that would be handy
and<00:02:37.250> then<00:02:39.620> vibrating<00:02:40.620> when<00:02:40.860> destroying

lighting and an animated water they were
talking<00:02:54.630> about<00:02:55.100> eventually<00:02:56.100> adding<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:57.120> know

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
talking about eventually adding you know

Sun<00:02:57.630> moon<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.280> stuff<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.819> that'll

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
Sun moon and stuff like that so that'll

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.390 
Sun moon and stuff like that so that'll
be<00:03:00.090> interesting<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:01.530> happy<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.190> hear

that people found in the and it's been

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.090 
that people found in the and it's been
there<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.180> while<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.630> been<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.100> files

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
there for a while it's been in the files

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.729 
there for a while it's been in the files
and<00:03:38.459> they<00:03:39.420> mentioned<00:03:39.870> something<00:03:39.930> about<00:03:40.440> maybe

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
and they mentioned something about maybe

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.039 
and they mentioned something about maybe
taking<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.820> would<00:03:42.450> take<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> screenshot

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
taking it would take a screenshot

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.960 
taking it would take a screenshot
wherever<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.560> placed<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.760> would<00:03:44.880> have

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
wherever you placed it that would have

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
wherever you placed it that would have
had<00:03:45.060> no<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.329> know<00:03:45.630> UI<00:03:45.810> or<00:03:46.170> anything<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.620> so

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
had no you know UI or anything on it so

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.400 
had no you know UI or anything on it so
that'd<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.250> pretty<00:03:47.459> cool<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.660> that's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
that'd be pretty cool so that's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.390 
that'd be pretty cool so that's
basically<00:03:50.010> all<00:03:50.130> I've<00:03:50.400> seen<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.239> far<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:52.400> caves

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
basically all I've seen so far and caves

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.530 
basically all I've seen so far and caves
is<00:03:53.609> another<00:03:53.850> idea<00:03:54.209> they've<00:03:54.510> had<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.650> yeah

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
is another idea they've had but yeah

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.140 
is another idea they've had but yeah
I'll<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.230> anything<00:03:58.530> else<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.069> find<00:03:59.150> and
