entertain at this point we will find
another<00:03:37.709> way<00:03:37.890> perhaps<00:03:38.849> these<00:03:47.569> these<00:03:48.569> cultists

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
another way perhaps these these cultists

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.280 
another way perhaps these these cultists
only<00:03:49.950> exacerbate<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.940> problem<00:03:51.450> they<00:03:51.900> preach

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290
