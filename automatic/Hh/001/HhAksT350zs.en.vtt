 definition or xli 3.870 and of nvidia 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.420
 geforce 8800 7 and memory is the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.160
 memory of the graphics card you already know 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.070
 what about gpu 512 mb and hard disk 30 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.009
 gb very well and now here are the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.630
 recommended to run it to the fullest 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.550
 this game that really is that yes it is worth 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.790
 it's totally worth investing with everything 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.070
 operating system windows 8 64 bits 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.350
 no magic windows 7 no longer windows 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.840
 8 64 bit amd processor six core one six 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 core cpu and intel a quad core no we 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.890
 says speed tells us nothing more than 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.080
 with that that is more than enough 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.520
 remember that what matters most to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.530
 run the games more so much the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.380
 processor but what is the memory 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.840
 dedicated video very well remove 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.550

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.090
 gigabytes the recommended and equal a 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.400
