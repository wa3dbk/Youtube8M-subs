00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.830
 I'm going to tell you about the battery. 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.420
 of lithium ions from the makita was 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 amazing battery right because it is very 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 versatile versatile interchangeable 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.010
 within a generous mix of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
 equipment 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 it has an extended service life in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.199
 conventional batteries that the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 market offers 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.360
 It has recharge cycles and immediate 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.640
 so in just 30 minutes do not ask 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.620
 mobilization does not have no end 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.180
 that bce battery thing or the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 equipment spends more time loading 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.329
 all this degenerative process plan 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 battery is that this free battery 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.430
 cool let's show where we can 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.350
 use this battery as you allegedly 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 said that this battery is versatile because 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.420
 she be interchangeable micromix we have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.739
 a saw called a tico-tico saw 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.340
 developed by the wood cutting 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.340
 Look, let's just do this process. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 how long does it work this is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.110
 variable for each type of material that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 will cut so we define the plan 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.070
 of recharge set in a few 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 moments we talk about consumption with 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.890
 this exchange of recharge I see him all 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 in the manual without all evil that the charger 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.729
 establishing the ricardo is a charger 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.000
 intelligent it communicates with you 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.070
 through a light pink light system 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.770
 that he emitted a luminous signal to emit 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.899
 means a resource other than a 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.820
 process other than 1 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.300
 I bought on the battery with everything 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.320
 this is part of the two machine set 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.360
 the remainder and in this case the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 radio, for example, also knows that the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.690
 advantage of in the lithium battery a tape 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 and this 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.350
 she serves in a generous mix of 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 equipment 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.740
 So we have drills we have one. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.740
 radinho 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.149
 Look the interesting little radix here 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.909
 to the work itself 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.340
 very cool and you can find it here in 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:16.390
 machines that is the mark of the best 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.390
 brands and products 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.460
 not
