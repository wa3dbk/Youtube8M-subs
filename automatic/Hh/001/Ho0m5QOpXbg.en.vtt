league of you know guys of NHL

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420 
league of you know guys of NHL
experience<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> mean<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.620> thought<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.280> did<00:02:55.400> a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
experience so I mean I thought we did a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.620 
experience so I mean I thought we did a
great<00:02:55.670> job<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.090> we<00:02:56.150> didn't<00:02:56.329> give<00:02:56.420> him<00:02:56.450> any

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
great job and we didn't give him any

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.080 
great job and we didn't give him any
opportunities<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:58.069> last<00:02:58.400> one<00:02:58.640> was<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:59.030> a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
opportunities so the last one was just a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.460 
opportunities so the last one was just a
little<00:02:59.299> bit<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.540> breakdown<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.230> think

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
little bit of a breakdown but I think

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.140 
little bit of a breakdown but I think
overall<00:03:00.890> we<00:03:01.010> had<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> pretty<00:03:01.400> good<00:03:01.519> PK<00:03:01.879> dinnae

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
overall we had a pretty good PK dinnae

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.050 
overall we had a pretty good PK dinnae
which<00:03:02.390> worked<00:03:02.900> out<00:03:03.110> but<00:03:03.530> uh<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.910> know<00:03:05.000> I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
which worked out but uh you know I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.240 
which worked out but uh you know I
thought<00:03:05.420> over<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.470> penalty<00:03:06.739> kill<00:03:06.860> we<00:03:07.129> did

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
thought over on the penalty kill we did

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.160 
thought over on the penalty kill we did
a<00:03:07.310> real<00:03:07.489> good<00:03:07.519> job<00:03:07.750> they<00:03:08.750> got<00:03:08.780> an<00:03:09.019> outstanding

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
a real good job they got an outstanding

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.190 
a real good job they got an outstanding
power<00:03:09.829> play<00:03:10.480> obviously<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.629> got<00:03:11.780> one<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.079> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
power play obviously they got one at the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.569 
power play obviously they got one at the
end<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:12.829> thought<00:03:13.040> overall<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
end there but I thought overall the

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.199 
end there but I thought overall the
penalty<00:03:13.940> kill<00:03:15.250> would<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> good<00:03:16.489> job<00:03:16.670> both<00:03:16.849> on

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
penalty kill would a good job both on

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.880 
penalty kill would a good job both on
our<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:17.690> checking<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.140> zones<00:03:18.379> was<00:03:18.620> pleased

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
our for checking in zones was pleased

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.140 
our for checking in zones was pleased
with<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:20.540> thought<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.910> know<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.060> thought

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
with that I thought you know I thought

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.059 
with that I thought you know I thought
our<00:03:23.450> second<00:03:23.840> period<00:03:24.139> we<00:03:24.260> picked<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
our second period we picked it up a

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.660 
our second period we picked it up a
notch<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.150> played<00:03:27.139> very<00:03:27.470> well<00:03:27.620> when<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.459> seem

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
notch and played very well when we seem

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.340 
notch and played very well when we seem
to<00:03:28.790> get<00:03:28.910> momentum<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.690> keep<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.049> momentum

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
to get momentum and keep the momentum

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.500 
to get momentum and keep the momentum
and<00:03:30.620> that's<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.859> positive<00:03:31.069> thing<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:32.269> know<00:03:32.359> one

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
and that's a positive thing you know one

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.699 
and that's a positive thing you know one
of<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> things<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:32.989> want<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.319> do<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> good<00:03:33.650> job

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
of the things we want to do a good job

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.979 
of the things we want to do a good job
of<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.310> limiting<00:03:34.760> other<00:03:34.970> team's<00:03:35.299> chances<00:03:35.810> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
of is limiting other team's chances and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.089 
of is limiting other team's chances and
certainly<00:03:36.230> with<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.530> team<00:03:36.799> with<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
certainly with that team with the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.789 
certainly with that team with the
firepower<00:03:37.519> they<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:38.349> you<00:03:39.349> don't<00:03:39.590> want<00:03:39.739> to

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
firepower they have you don't want to

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.199 
firepower they have you don't want to
give<00:03:39.920> them<00:03:39.980> any<00:03:40.099> easy<00:03:40.370> offense<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.090> thought

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
give them any easy offense and I thought

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.849 
give them any easy offense and I thought
overall<00:03:41.359> we<00:03:41.690> did<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> good<00:03:42.019> job<00:03:42.079> of<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.500> you

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
overall we did a good job of that you

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.099 
overall we did a good job of that you
think
