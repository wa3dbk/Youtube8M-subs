 with this wonderful palette that it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.660
 long time ago that I do not have any 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.329

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 so take something similar 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860
 a beautiful pale beige brown that looks like 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 your skin type but slightly more 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 strong so it's so I take my brush of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 at mac the 217 which is a flat 6 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 of maybelline a MÃ©tis studio I was going 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 in several other colors I 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 my beverage from the beginning to really 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.420
 even more to limit my hollow and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.720
 to make a nice transition from 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.720
 colors 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.370

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.410

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.050

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.020
 239 tapping and sliding gently 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.450
 at the base of missiles and going up a 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:02:00.740
 little bit in my mind so I'm doing a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:02.990
 form of life then I resume 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.910
 pin macrophytes and I come blondy the 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.860
