you're looking quite bored and if you've
got<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.930> size<00:00:57.200> UK<00:00:57.530> 10<00:00:57.920> at<00:00:58.040> above<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.520> need<00:00:58.670> to

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
got a size UK 10 at above in you need to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.200 
got a size UK 10 at above in you need to
consider<00:00:58.790> a<00:00:59.360> mid<00:01:00.140> wide<00:01:00.380> or<00:01:00.710> whiteboard<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.940> if

consider a mid wide or whiteboard and if
you're<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> girl<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.410> you<00:01:03.559> should<00:01:03.770> maybe

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
you're a girl then you should maybe

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.030 
you're a girl then you should maybe
consider<00:01:04.219> a<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.879> specifically<00:01:05.500> as<00:01:06.500> they<00:01:06.830> pay

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
consider a go specifically as they pay

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.170 
consider a go specifically as they pay
to<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.310> for<00:01:07.580> smaller<00:01:07.909> foot<00:01:08.180> soldiers<00:01:10.180> length

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
to that for smaller foot soldiers length

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.420 
to that for smaller foot soldiers length
so<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.440> this<00:01:12.560> case<00:01:12.830> as<00:01:13.130> you're<00:01:13.340> doing

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
so in this case as you're doing

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.800 
so in this case as you're doing
instructor<00:01:13.970> training<00:01:14.180> course<00:01:14.479> you're<00:01:14.690> going

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
instructor training course you're going

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.390 
instructor training course you're going
to<00:01:14.870> be<00:01:14.930> writing<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.290> whole<00:01:15.440> melted<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.340> you

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
to be writing the whole melted so you

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.770 
to be writing the whole melted so you
should<00:01:16.700> really<00:01:16.880> look<00:01:17.060> at<00:01:17.210> normal<00:01:17.450> mountain

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
should really look at normal mountain

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.260 
should really look at normal mountain
board<00:01:18.190> all-mountain<00:01:19.190> really<00:01:19.670> refers<00:01:20.030> to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
board all-mountain really refers to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.500 
board all-mountain really refers to
writing<00:01:21.310> variables<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.580> mean<00:01:23.180> that's<00:01:23.299> off

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
writing variables I mean that's off

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.590 
writing variables I mean that's off
piece<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.049> bloody<00:01:25.010> fight<00:01:25.340> right<00:01:25.729> in<00:01:25.880> park<00:01:26.210> and

inside if you're a little bit light then

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.780 
inside if you're a little bit light then
you<00:01:38.530> maybe<00:01:38.740> should<00:01:38.799> consider<00:01:39.280> sizing<00:01:39.460> down<00:01:39.670> a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
you maybe should consider sizing down a

few centimeters and if you little bit
heavy<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.130> should<00:01:42.610> maybe<00:01:42.880> consider<00:01:43.030> going<00:01:43.450> up

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
heavy and should maybe consider going up

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.600

artec resistance from the nose and tail

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.190 
artec resistance from the nose and tail
it<00:01:57.549> also<00:01:57.700> means<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.330> nose<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.720> ten<00:01:58.899> at

it also means that the nose and ten at

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.520 
it also means that the nose and ten at
the<00:01:59.470> same<00:01:59.910> flex<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.960> makes<00:02:02.200> switch

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
the same flex and this makes switch

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.320 
the same flex and this makes switch
riding<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:03.009> lot<00:02:03.100> easier<00:02:03.280> which<00:02:04.030> will<00:02:04.210> be

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
riding a lot easier which will be

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.249 
riding a lot easier which will be
assessed<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:06.149> flex<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:07.600> there<00:02:07.750> were<00:02:07.810> two<00:02:07.990> types

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
assessed on flex so there were two types

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.020 
assessed on flex so there were two types
of<00:02:08.380> flex<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.769> snowboard<00:02:09.250> firstly
