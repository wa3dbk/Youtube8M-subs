00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello!

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm Boram Ko of The Gobo jewelry brand

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200
We are currently preparing for the 2015 S/S products

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.780
We wanted to try something new we haven't tried before

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.620
So we are here to do market research

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.140
We will be checking if there are any new materials

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.340
And if there is anything we can learn about

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.900
When we had first started doing market research

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.960
We would get lost in the market so many times

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.560
It took hours for us to find the stores we were looking for

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.700
But now, we only go to out clients' store and the stores nearby

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.900
Hello!

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.480
OMG!

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.140
We're filming The ICONtv!

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.260
Are they filming me right now?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.760
Yes!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.660
I should have dressed up for this!

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.440
She helped me a lot to get settled

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.480
After all your times together, what do you think about her?

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.960
Boram Ko?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.340
She's really pretty

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.820
And she's great at her job!

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.700
Fighting, The Gobo!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.160
I majored in computer science

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.260
And worked at a portal company for awhile

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.840
I actually started this as a hobby

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.680
But luckily, I had gotten some great feedbacks

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.900
That's how I could still do the business to today

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900
So this job must have been a new challenge for you!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.800
It was a major challenge!

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.140
I had given up a stable job and a high salary for this...

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.620
Please go to Hongdae area!

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.020
We're going to Yeonhui-dong!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.640
We are heading to one of the select shops that has our brand!

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.940
Hello!

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.520
Hello!

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.260
Are these new items?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.340
Yes!

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.840
Oh! Are those new items?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.440
Yes! These two come as a set

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.480
One is a regular sized ring

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.500
And the other one is for a pinky or a knuckle

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.320
Boram Ko is really popular

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920
So I actually worried if I couldn't do business with her

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.340
But she willingly said yes!

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.020
And she has been very active!

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.160
What~

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.760
Bye~

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.180
Thank you~

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.320
Where are you going now?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.800
We have to go back to the office

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.700
And finish everything off

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.380
And work on the 2015 S/S designs!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.920
This is our office

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.700
We use the computer here to do the designing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.180
And this table is where we do the actual making of the jewlries

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.500
I have to tell you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.220
Designing is the harder work!

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.100
Don't you get confused since there are many materials?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.120
It may look messy...

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.720
But it is organized in our own way

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.400
Huh? Where is it?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.780
You must have forgotten all the rules!

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.460
Not all of them...

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.140
Model So-hyun Ko modeled for the lookbook!

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.660
Isn't she your sister?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.820
A photoshoot?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.800
Me?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.760
The Gobo!

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.920
Oh~ The lookbook!

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.580
I want to do more for her once the business gets better!

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.740
Even if I can't pay a lot of attention to you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.920
I know you're doing well!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's keep it up!

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540
Thank you! Fighting!

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.220
To be standing where you are

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.840
Did everything work out for you?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.420
It may look like that to  the outside world

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.000
But there were actually many twists and turns

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.520
We wanted to get higher...

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.300
But we would run into obstacles

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.580
But I think facing obstacles is natural in businesses

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.580
We should do better!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.380
Even better!
