the<00:01:33.540> total<00:01:33.900> 60<00:01:34.320> i'm<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.189> sure<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.460> there's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the total 60 i'm not sure if there's

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
the total 60 i'm not sure if there's
going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.820> motivation<00:01:36.360> issues<00:01:36.509> for

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going to be motivation issues for

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
going to be motivation issues for
georgia<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.560> um<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> had<00:01:38.460> he<00:01:38.549> kept<00:01:38.729> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
georgia but um when I had he kept this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
georgia but um when I had he kept this
game<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.630> thinking<00:01:39.960> maybe<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> total

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
game I was thinking maybe the the total

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
game I was thinking maybe the the total
on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> under<00:01:41.549> might<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.030> best<00:01:42.180> play<00:01:42.420> here

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
on the under might be the best play here

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
on the under might be the best play here
under<00:01:42.930> 60<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.189> George's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
under 60 you know I think George's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
under 60 you know I think George's
defense<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.810> tend<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
defense when they you know they tend to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
defense when they you know they tend to
get<00:01:46.470> shredded<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:47.490> they're<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.759> their<00:01:47.970> game

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
get shredded when they're off their game

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
get shredded when they're off their game
when<00:01:48.329> they're<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.479> their<00:01:48.750> game<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
when they're on their game they can be

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
when they're on their game they can be
good<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.850> Nebraska<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> great<00:01:51.240> pass

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
good and Nebraska has a great pass

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
good and Nebraska has a great pass
defense<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:52.079> plays<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.530> into<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.829> Georgia

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
defense which plays right into a Georgia

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.410 
defense which plays right into a Georgia
strength<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.060> might<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.270> able<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
strength they might be able to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.230 
strength they might be able to
neutralize<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.170> thinking<00:01:55.409> under<00:01:55.619> 60

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
neutralize that I'm thinking under 60

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
neutralize that I'm thinking under 60
under<00:01:57.240> 60<00:01:57.570> could<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.840> okay<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.439> roll

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
under 60 could be okay I'm gonna roll

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
under 60 could be okay I'm gonna roll

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

I think Wisconsin

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.330 
I think Wisconsin
with<00:02:13.840> all<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.110> thin<00:02:14.290> changes<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.069> there

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
like a 41 217 4124 type game so you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.430 
like a 41 217 4124 type game so you

a double-digit win here even though they

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.550 
a double-digit win here even though they
probably<00:02:43.360> feel<00:02:43.690> inside<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.440> know

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
title game they got enough time to force

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.210 
title game they got enough time to force
this<00:02:49.840> one<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.290> think<00:02:50.530> mark<00:02:50.739> Greeks<00:02:51.010> are

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
this one and I think mark Greeks are

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.590 
this one and I think mark Greeks are
good<00:02:51.340> enough<00:02:51.580> coach<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.360> team

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
good enough coach to have this team

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.210 
good enough coach to have this team
ready<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.900> play<00:02:53.019> Erin<00:02:53.590> Murray<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.980> great

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
ready to play Erin Murray is a great

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.040 
ready to play Erin Murray is a great
leader<00:02:54.519> great<00:02:54.940> quarterback<00:02:55.510> he's<00:02:55.690> proved<00:02:55.930> it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
leader great quarterback he's proved it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.810 
leader great quarterback he's proved it
all<00:02:56.170> year<00:02:56.320> long<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.830> think<00:02:57.220> George<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.580> more

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
all year long I think George is more

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.550 
all year long I think George is more
well<00:02:58.030> balanced<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.690> Nebraska<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.440> Nebraska

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
well balanced in Nebraska think Nebraska

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.320 
well balanced in Nebraska think Nebraska
kind<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.160> brings<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.610> one-dimensional

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
kind of brings in a one-dimensional

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.729 
kind of brings in a one-dimensional
offense<00:03:01.480> where<00:03:02.019> they<00:03:02.140> depend<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.590> their

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
offense where they depend on their

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.949 
offense where they depend on their
quarterback<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.610> bit<00:03:03.760> too<00:03:03.940> much<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.420> like

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
quarterback a little bit too much I like

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.380 
quarterback a little bit too much I like
George's<00:03:05.440> balanced<00:03:05.830> offense<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.640> defense<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
George's balanced offense and defense I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.670 
George's balanced offense and defense I
think<00:03:07.840> they<00:03:07.959> come<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.260> play<00:03:08.440> they've<00:03:08.590> had

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
think they come to play they've had

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.440 
think they come to play they've had
enough<00:03:08.860> time<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.130> flush<00:03:09.550> that<00:03:09.790> game<00:03:10.030> against

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
enough time to flush that game against

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.809 
enough time to flush that game against
Alabama<00:03:11.170> which<00:03:11.440> they<00:03:11.590> had<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> bag<00:03:12.160> Nick

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
Alabama which they had in the bag Nick

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.090 
Alabama which they had in the bag Nick
Georgia<00:03:13.180> shows<00:03:13.420> up<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> way<00:03:13.900> they<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.140> SEC<00:03:15.040> is

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Georgia shows up the way they do SEC is

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.590 
Georgia shows up the way they do SEC is
a<00:03:15.190> much<00:03:15.370> better<00:03:15.400> conference<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.420> Big<00:03:16.569> Ten

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
a much better conference in the Big Ten

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.330 
a much better conference in the Big Ten
this<00:03:16.959> year<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> think<00:03:17.410> there's<00:03:17.560> no<00:03:17.620> comparison

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
this year I think there's no comparison

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.979 
this year I think there's no comparison
there<00:03:18.519> I<00:03:18.760> like<00:03:19.180> Georgia<00:03:19.510> win<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:19.810> game

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
there I like Georgia win this game

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.990 
there I like Georgia win this game
pretty<00:03:20.260> handily<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.709> think<00:03:21.160> under<00:03:21.370> 60<00:03:21.730> could<00:03:21.880> be

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
pretty handily I think under 60 could be

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.699 
pretty handily I think under 60 could be
safe<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:22.510> don't<00:03:23.049> be<00:03:23.110> surprised<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.560> see

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
safe but don't be surprised to see

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.650 
safe but don't be surprised to see
Georgia<00:03:24.070> sneak<00:03:24.310> into<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.640> 30s<00:03:25.000> or<00:03:25.090> 40s<00:03:25.150> in

Georgia sneak into the 30s or 40s in
Nebraska<00:03:26.230> into<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.500> 20s<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.070> like<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.400> do<00:03:27.519> like

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
