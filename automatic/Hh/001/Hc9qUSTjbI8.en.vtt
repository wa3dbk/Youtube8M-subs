00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hi, I'm gizelli sousa, this is one more 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.730
 instead of revenue on the point as it exits the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 routine and will bring a breaded chicken 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.180
 stuffed with creamy curd cheese and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.699
 super soft and delicious 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.630
 we go to great floods a breast 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 chicken a spoonful of creamy curd 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 50 ml of milk 5 tablespoons of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.669
 bread flour and butter rice to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.430
 To start, we'll cut the chicken. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.170
 in butterflies if you do not know ask 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.040
 The sun butcher cut it but it's okay 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.809
 simple 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.629
 will start the thickest part of the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.590
 chicken with a very sharp knife and will 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.590
 slowly nato 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.730
 be careful not to split the chicken in the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.730
 medium 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.920
 now that it's open we're going 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 need to tune a bit then 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.590
 put here for that of plastic 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 same fruit supermarket 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.890
 I'm going to hit him and I'm going to hit a 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.880
 roll of pasta but you can beat 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 if you have home 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.220
 I'm going to season it, it's very simple just with 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.540
 lemon the kilo salt of the pepper and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.430
 salt if the ideal is you leave it does not have 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.130
 whole for at least half an hour 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.660
 at 20 minutes if you can so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.550
 it will get more flavor 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 but if you can not, no problem 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.860
 Just remembers enough to fill him with me. 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.710
 I put the plastic underneath so I can 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.229
 help coil and I'll put more 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 or a spoon full of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.550
 Cream cheese 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.040
 if you want you can use concretize or 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.270
 put any other full 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.860
 now here is only bend but calm 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 is to have no danger after leaking 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.500
 Now I'll do wrong to deceive 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.510
 I'll season flour the pound of salt 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 pepper and a little salt yes 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.879
 I'm using bread bran but you 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.879
 can use flour 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.150
 I'll pass the chicken here first in the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.620
 flour is important to cover it for not 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.599
 pour the curd and also to protect 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.599
 the chicken to not get too dry 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:03:01.510
 I will now move from the milk quickly 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.560
 the new meal after clearing anything 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.540
 if you can 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.579
 take him to play and I left some time 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.349
 waiting to be able to adhere well to flour 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.349
 or just transfer to the baking sheet 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.680
 I'll put a little butter 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680
 or margarine 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.960
 now just take to bake in the oven 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.690
 preheated to 180 degrees for 20 minutes 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.170
 but be careful not to leak and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.120
 enjoy 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.190
