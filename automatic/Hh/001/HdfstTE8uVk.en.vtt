00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so of the milk it really doesn't matter

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.110 
so of the milk it really doesn't matter
the<00:00:57.210> amount<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.870> culture<00:00:58.530> starter<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.280> work

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the amount the culture starter will work

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
the amount the culture starter will work
with<00:01:00.359> any<00:01:00.390> amount<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.050> milk<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.440> long<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
with any amount of milk as long as you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130

milk and then I'm simply going to turn

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.530 
milk and then I'm simply going to turn
on<00:01:06.600> my<00:01:06.630> heat<00:01:07.040> I'm<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> keep<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> low<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
know in its skin temperature you just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.810 
know in its skin temperature you just
insert<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:21.689> clean<00:01:21.990> knuckle<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
hot and when you can't feel the milk
you'll<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:30.540> temperature

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you'll know it's the right temperature

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
you'll know it's the right temperature
if<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.590> bit<00:01:31.710> warm<00:01:31.950> okay<00:01:32.280> that's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
if it's a little bit warm okay that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
if it's a little bit warm okay that's
fine<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.150> take<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> off<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> heat

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
fine but just take it off the heat

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
fine but just take it off the heat
straight<00:01:34.259> away<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.790> let<00:01:35.970> let<00:01:36.119> let<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.689> get

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
straight away so we let let let this get

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
straight away so we let let let this get
up<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.259> skin<00:01:37.590> temperature<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.090> we

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
up to skin temperature and then all we

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.050 
up to skin temperature and then all we
do<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.930> only<00:01:40.049> takes<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.439> couple<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.740> minutes

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
do this only takes a couple of minutes

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.289 
do this only takes a couple of minutes
just<00:01:42.060> add<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.860> culture<00:01:43.860> starter<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.970> lots<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
just add a culture starter it's lots of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
just add a culture starter it's lots of
friendly<00:01:45.720> bacteria<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:47.340> sprinkle<00:01:47.909> them<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
friendly bacteria just sprinkle them in

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.480 
friendly bacteria just sprinkle them in
and<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> whisk

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.090
