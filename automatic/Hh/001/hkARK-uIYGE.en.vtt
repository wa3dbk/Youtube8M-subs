00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.839
 now we have immediately followed them 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 meetings tempted by me from Ukraine 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.450
 giulia saw her in a ring duric this 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.719
 there is a peculiarity this girl who 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.000
 was born on 11 June 1997 at 15 years old 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.430
 and the youngest figure skater 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 of the European and it is fun because then 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 instead here we will also see the skater 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.369
 in older quotes than this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.160
 European that yuko kavaguti and the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.779
 older skater I like to say 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.779
 more experienced robin szolkowy 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.500
 well triple jump launched 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.909
 written in parallel 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.239
 particularly the exercise they have 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 proposed athletes from potentates 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.750
 ukraine 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 they are the 2011 2012 national champions 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.349
 and presented their exercise 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.970
 on the music of the film sherlock holmes 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.060
 they come from a junior grand circuit 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.160
 prix and this is a bit frank there was 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.610
 nothing is seen then you said yourself 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.420
 goes the youngest evaluative basil of 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.180
 this event usually 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.960
 is in the field of women in the field 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.230
 of women instead of being 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.810
 in couples, however, I would say that in little 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.360
 time they really set up one 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.570
 promising couple with vouchers 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.070
 basic elements with a minimum of 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.400
 there is also choreography to say that 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.080
 this year really the short is not 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.060
 easy because the outer spiral 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.590
 back is one of those things that 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 we have also seen more couples 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.359
 have experienced having problems in the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.850
 yes yes absolutely 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.400
 worth many points for charity though value 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.650
 equal base for all at this point two 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.050
 80 basic value points in this case 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.510
 they took all the basic value e 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.220
 without god and one has remained zero and who does not 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.680
 has taken the level that is its own value 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.410
 future of the spiral because at least they have 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.110
 reached the positions that are here 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.660
 everyone always thinks like this 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.640
 spiral does not go down as low as 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.800
 instead it can go down here we see it 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.840
 right here because of the position 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.880
 because the external back does not allow 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.670
 to go like this 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.410
 let it land as the interior allows 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.210
 forward inside back then by 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.160
 we will never see this, we say in the 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.210
 classic position and you explained to us 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.310
 always even the most expert things e 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.680
 differently the bow is really a kind of 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.540
 bridge that makes the woman with the back that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.050
 must mark in a certain way must 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.850
 press at certain points on his body to 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.850
 make this arc be created 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.070
 this tension, however, is never seen 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.260
 this spiral so low so people 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.750
 almost parallel to the ice 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.820
 in fact, here they can see them again 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.150
 to be a beginner I must say that 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.630
 they have completed their short manner 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.180
 this is definitely decorous for them 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.710
 the first European 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.930
 now we're going to see just the 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:51.190
 score for these skaters 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:53.980
 and here it is then 41 and 66 with 22 37 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.320
 for panama data on 19 and 22 for 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.390
 the download components and therefore in 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.190
 this golden moment is therefore the 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.410
 news obviously about components e 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.720
 we still see very much values 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.729
 low but we emphasized a couple 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.909
 obviously very young 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:13.979
 European junior couple's debut 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.979
 to all intents and purposes xvi
