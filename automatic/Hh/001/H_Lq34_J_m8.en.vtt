these guys will bring their stance in a
little<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.430> they<00:03:02.459> compete<00:03:03.319> when<00:03:04.319> they

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
little bit when they compete when they

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.970 
little bit when they compete when they
put<00:03:04.590> their<00:03:04.709> squat<00:03:05.040> suit<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:06.709> Tressa<00:03:07.709> could

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
probably sit on the box a little bit

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.449 
probably sit on the box a little bit
more<00:03:10.170> he's<00:03:10.380> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.680> racing<00:03:11.010> through<00:03:11.220> those

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.640 

but<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.780> reason<00:03:16.079> for<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.470> sometimes

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
but the reason for that is sometimes

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.770 
but the reason for that is sometimes
when<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:16.980> put<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.190> more<00:03:17.489> power<00:03:17.730> than<00:03:18.000> gear<00:03:18.299> you

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
when you put on more power than gear you

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
when you put on more power than gear you
throw<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.049> suit<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.350> over<00:03:19.590> top<00:03:19.799> of<00:03:19.829> those<00:03:20.040> briefs

throw a suit on over top of those briefs

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.150 
throw a suit on over top of those briefs
and<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:21.810> knees<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.290> start<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> cave<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:22.860> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and your knees can start to cave in a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.039 
and your knees can start to cave in a
little<00:03:23.370> bit<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.390> amount<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.720> compression

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
little bit do the amount of compression

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.210 
little bit do the amount of compression
that<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:28.260> in<00:03:28.620> training<00:03:29.100> you

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
that you have on but in training you

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.620 
that you have on but in training you
make<00:03:29.370> your<00:03:29.489> training<00:03:29.850> harder<00:03:30.209> than<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.450> meat

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
itself and so will will train at

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.680 
itself and so will will train at
different<00:03:32.670> angles<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.030> work<00:03:33.299> on<00:03:33.450> some

different<00:03:33.810> stances<00:03:34.380> will<00:03:34.560> train<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> little

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
different stances will train a little

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.759 
different stances will train a little
wide<00:03:35.190> will<00:03:35.430> train<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.640> little<00:03:35.790> close<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:37.590> try

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
wide will train a little close just try

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.819 
wide will train a little close just try
