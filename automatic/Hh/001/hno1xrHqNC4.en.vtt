00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
towards the end of World War black ops 1

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.689 
towards the end of World War black ops 1
and<00:00:59.199> black<00:00:59.289> ops<00:00:59.500> 2<00:00:59.710> they<00:00:59.829> really<00:01:00.219> started<00:01:00.609> to

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and black ops 2 they really started to

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.119 
and black ops 2 they really started to
focus<00:01:00.820> on<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.410> storyline<00:01:02.410> I<00:01:02.620> guess<00:01:02.920> for

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
focus on the storyline I guess for

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.799 
focus on the storyline I guess for
zombies<00:01:03.640> but<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:03.879> wasn't<00:01:04.150> actually<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.449> full

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
zombies but it wasn't actually a full

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.630 
zombies but it wasn't actually a full
campaign<00:01:05.230> instead<00:01:05.470> there<00:01:06.040> were<00:01:06.100> just<00:01:06.220> easter

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
campaign instead there were just easter

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.790 
campaign instead there were just easter
eggs<00:01:06.760> in<00:01:06.970> each<00:01:07.120> map<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.630> would<00:01:07.750> take<00:01:07.960> between

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
eggs in each map that would take between

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.980 
eggs in each map that would take between
about<00:01:09.190> half<00:01:09.490> an<00:01:09.700> hour<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.940> maybe<00:01:10.330> two<00:01:10.630> hours<00:01:10.659> to

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
about half an hour to maybe two hours to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.480 
about half an hour to maybe two hours to
actually<00:01:11.110> complete<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.159> went<00:01:12.400> about

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
actually complete but I went about

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.300 
actually complete but I went about
having<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.060> full<00:01:13.479> seven<00:01:14.350> eight<00:01:14.680> hour<00:01:14.890> long

back<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.530> think<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.920> was<00:01:24.009> something<00:01:24.130> they

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
back I think that was something they

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.100 
back I think that was something they
could<00:01:24.460> have<00:01:24.700> done<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.939> lot<00:01:25.180> more<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:25.990> they

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
could have done a lot more with but they

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.600 
could have done a lot more with but they
didn't<00:01:26.439> really<00:01:26.650> do<00:01:26.799> so<00:01:27.009> hopefully<00:01:27.400> we<00:01:27.490> can

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
didn't really do so hopefully we can

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.980 
didn't really do so hopefully we can
have<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.759> in<00:01:27.970> back<00:01:28.119> up<00:01:28.270> sorry<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.840> also

new game modes could we have two zombies

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.730 
new game modes could we have two zombies
but<00:01:39.399> for<00:01:39.549> me<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.060> round<00:01:40.360> based<00:01:40.750> game<00:01:41.200> mode<00:01:41.439> get

having fun with your friends it is

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.370 
having fun with your friends it is
probably<00:01:46.210> always<00:01:46.509> going<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> be<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.990> best<00:01:47.170> but

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
probably always going to be the best but

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.389 
probably always going to be the best but
a<00:01:47.560> full-on<00:01:48.189> campaign<00:01:48.790> for<00:01:49.360> me<00:01:49.540> would<00:01:50.140> be

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
a full-on campaign for me would be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.340 
a full-on campaign for me would be
amazing<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.490> would<00:01:51.759> where<00:01:52.689> would<00:01:52.719> where<00:01:53.200> they

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
amazing I would where would where they

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.840 
amazing I would where would where they
would<00:01:53.469> go<00:01:53.500> with<00:01:53.829> that<00:01:53.950> honestly<00:01:54.369> I'm<00:01:54.579> not

would go with that honestly I'm not
really<00:01:55.149> too<00:01:55.479> sure<00:01:55.509> possibly<00:01:56.110> they<00:01:56.560> would<00:01:56.710> have

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
really too sure possibly they would have

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.880 
really too sure possibly they would have
to<00:01:56.979> start<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.520> brand<00:01:57.880> new<00:01:58.060> storyline<00:01:58.710> maybe<00:01:59.710> new
