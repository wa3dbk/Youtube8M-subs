00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi everyone so toxic I hope 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.290
 that you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.270
 so today come together for a 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.130
 new video so a heavy video 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.480
 I hope it will please you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 any case me personally I cross 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 the fingers for it to go to editing 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.780
 because good my inactivity 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 it's due to the material clears coming 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.230
 really missteps to make two records 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.730
 since I went under a dose 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 so say there I really hope I 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 cross your fingers so that this video 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.490
 works 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.539
 Anyway what I should be 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.800
 find for two gameplay and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.449
 some screen so they will you 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 please I hope these some info on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 wild ride so we start first 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480
 place with the gameplay on the monster 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 truck the gains so I'm going to make you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.899
 scroll down the gameplay and then you go 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 look at it honestly me 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 personally from what I see on the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.309
 gameplay I really like it at the level 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 of the interface everything has been changed 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 rossi of change it's always 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 fun so the monster truck this center 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.640
 is simple we will be in an arena and the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.960
 goal is to garner a maximum of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 points 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.239
 at the same time they were not going to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 do speed racing on 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.260
 the booster trucks would not have been top 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 so the interface 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 yeah that's what strikes most a 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
 high level directly a fat body of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 gameplay that's it changes and it's 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.610
 really nice so the queen 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 that's classic honestly do 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.310
 little figures it makes us points 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 definitely it's really but really 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.520
 stylish with the guys do not hesitate to say 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.930
 the comments what do you think of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.729
 gameplay in any case it seems fun 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 really tested finally we will hear on 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.479
 wait until the exit 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.520
 it really seems to be super fun 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 so the second much more unobstructed on the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 drift 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.390
 ah there there are a few more things to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 to say simply because I said 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.380
 that I watched gameplay the first 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.750
 times I just feel 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.799
 to find me a little in need for 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 speed prostreet if I do not have any 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.740
 nonsense good of course a point at the level 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.299
 of the gameplay that would mean 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 bullshit but nothing but at the level of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.450
 point system that we show how 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.920
 it works anyway it's good 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.689
 nice when we see the guy come down in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.750
 mountain like that looks well styled 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.280
 and well, here's what drift wages 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.509
 tops after me I really like this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.680
 discipline in any game of 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 car so I think it can give 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 really totally gameplay 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.700
 different and really please a lot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.320
 people 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.119
 good to fight it can be 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 really really nice even with the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.969
 good with friends it can really be 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.189
 cool about what's going to end up 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.509
 with some screens so there we get 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.060
 found with screen so that proves 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.000
 that the bike will be customizable so that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.740
 it's stylish in change 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.720
 several times of color and then after 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.850
 I managed to dig up a small screen 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.770
 really nice is that this is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.380
 really sure it's pretty official in 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.670
 anyway in any case safe on the screen 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.530
 from the developer we can see that there will be 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 also motorcycles cross guys so 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.709
 it's really nice especially if you can 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.209
 do as the smaller of the screen 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.650
 small cocks small children 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.650
 wheeling honestly it can be 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.700
 really but really nice so here 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.080
 that was all I had to say about 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.850
 video anyway I really hope you 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.709
 can view it and especially lalique 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.790
 and appreciated for the guys 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.209
 find again in the new video point 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.820
 come on hi everyone 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.600
 the distance of view has been 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.580
 greatly improved and 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 thoroughly we have fully 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.209
 redo the 3d engine to go to 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.630
 something based on references 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.150
 physical 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.160
 we also added a weather system 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.700
 complete that affects the road and your 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.700
 working conditions
