some<00:01:42.990> action<00:01:43.909> I'll<00:01:44.909> click<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.509> time

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
some action I'll click it one more time

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440 
some action I'll click it one more time
because<00:01:46.049> Windows<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.680> painfully<00:01:47.159> slow<00:01:47.450> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
because Windows is painfully slow in

because Windows is painfully slow in
fact<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> guys<00:01:49.200> were<00:01:49.380> running<00:01:49.619> Linux<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
fact if you guys were running Linux you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
fact if you guys were running Linux you
would<00:01:50.159> actually<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.210> Python<00:01:51.570> installed<00:01:51.750> by

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
would actually have Python installed by

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
would actually have Python installed by
default<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.210> would<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.329> able<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
default and you would be able to just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
default and you would be able to just
download<00:01:55.170> idle<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.579> uh<00:01:59.090> programs

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
download idle or the little uh programs

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.039

we're going to be used to write our
Python<00:02:01.409> code<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.270> I'll<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> more

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
Python code so I'll get to more

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
Python code so I'll get to more
information<00:02:03.990> about<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.549> eventually<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
information about that eventually and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.240 
information about that eventually and
very<00:02:05.850> soon<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.689> are<00:02:06.719> Python<00:02:07.229> org<00:02:07.680> now

with<00:02:22.890> ah<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.670> suggest<00:02:24.330> two<00:02:24.870> point<00:02:25.140> seven<00:02:25.379> point

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
with ah I suggest two point seven point

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.050 
with ah I suggest two point seven point
two<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.069> still<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.430> by<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> time<00:02:26.909> you're

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
two if it's still out by the time you're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.410 
two if it's still out by the time you're
watching<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.950> yeah<00:02:29.760> look<00:02:30.209> for

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
watching this and yeah look for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.509 
watching this and yeah look for
something<00:02:30.690> called<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> Windows<00:02:31.260> binary<00:02:31.709> that's

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
something called a Windows binary that's

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.820 
something called a Windows binary that's
the<00:02:32.849> Installer<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.750> binary<00:02:34.140> sits<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the Installer the binary sits the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.589 
the Installer the binary sits the
executable<00:02:35.400> file<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.940> obviously<00:02:36.480> you're

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
executable file and obviously you're

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.520 
executable file and obviously you're
running<00:02:36.810> Windows<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:37.349> what<00:02:37.440> we're

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
running Windows so that's what we're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.690 
running Windows so that's what we're
gonna<00:02:37.620> want<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:39.560> boom<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:40.829> we<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.099> save

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
gonna want here boom here we go save

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.819 
gonna want here boom here we go save
this<00:02:41.879> file

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
this file

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
like I'm just saving the desktop for now

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.059 
like I'm just saving the desktop for now
so<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:48.959> comfy<00:02:49.290> since<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
so it's comfy since this is just the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.289 
so it's comfy since this is just the
Installer<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.519> don't<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.879> do<00:02:51.000> too<00:02:51.150> much

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
Installer we don't have to do too much

I'll minimize things clean things up a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.699 
I'll minimize things clean things up a
little<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.459> and<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:01.799> have<00:03:02.010> Python<00:03:02.459> soon

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
little bit and you will have Python soon

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.069 
little bit and you will have Python soon
I'm<00:03:04.709> sure<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:05.069> guys<00:03:05.220> cannot<00:03:05.670> wait<00:03:08.329> 96<00:03:09.329> 97<00:03:09.660> 98<00:03:10.019> I

run the program and you can install for
all<00:03:21.930> users<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.739> kind<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.130> recommend<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.639> just

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
all users I kind of recommend that just

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.819 
all users I kind of recommend that just
because<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.120> easy<00:03:24.329> it's<00:03:24.599> setup<00:03:25.319> by<00:03:25.500> default

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829

interface as far as I know

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.030 
interface as far as I know
and<00:03:47.519> then<00:03:48.389> things<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.989> might<00:03:49.169> need<00:03:49.349> are<00:03:49.799> all

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
and then things you might need are all

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.030 
and then things you might need are all
here<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.750> suggest<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.139> take<00:03:52.319> all<00:03:52.470> all<00:03:52.799> of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
here I suggest that you take all all of

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.490 
here I suggest that you take all all of
it<00:03:53.160> though<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:53.700> get<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.500> greatest

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it though so you can get the greatest

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.229 
it though so you can get the greatest
advantage<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.459> make<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.940> most<00:03:57.060> out

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
advantage and you can make the most out

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.539 
advantage and you can make the most out
of<00:03:57.299> what<00:03:57.389> you<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.099> then<00:03:59.099> boom<00:03:59.370> it'll

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
of what you have and then boom it'll

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.640 
of what you have and then boom it'll
start<00:03:59.790> installing<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.200> cancel<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.590> if

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
start installing you can cancel it if

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.479 
start installing you can cancel it if
you<00:04:01.799> need<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> but<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.639> don't<00:04:03.629> see<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> need<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.489> it
