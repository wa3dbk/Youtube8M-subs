00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello that such friends as they are good today 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.010
 let's prepare let's cook some 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.460
 French fries 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.520
 that the ingredients will be very easy 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 what we need are medium potatoes 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 a little salt oil and pepper 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.770
 what we are going to do now is to have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 clean our potatoes 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.100
 the rod and now what we are going to do is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.500
 make a few cuts in this case I would 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.030
 I'm going to do half moon 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.309
 to put them to cook 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.489
 what we are going to do now is grab 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.420
 one of these tapas are medium we are going to 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.420
 cut in half 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 since we have this cut we turn it over and 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.239
 we are going to do is that the eyes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.970
 and now we have like this comments as of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.980
 half Moon 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.810
 and here I recommend that they be 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.810
 medium as you can see here 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.189
 or if they want a little smaller 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.790
 you can also do it this is a bit 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.410
 smaller 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.410
 and we have another cut 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.190
 we already have our forms now what 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 let's do is put a pot with water 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.530
 hot to put them to cook 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.900
 Now that we have our pot with 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.610
 hot water we will place care 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.570
 the potatoes are going to be left there 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.570
 cooking 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 we cover it and let it cook 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.240
 now what we are going to do 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.280
 three times and they are already cooked we are going to 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.280
 give one and this 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.180
 cooked 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.840
 in this case it is big we are going to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.840
 enclose as a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.069
 a knife and if we see that it does not cost 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.519
 work this means that they are already 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.790
 lists what we are going to do now is 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.440
 turn off the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.450
 Y 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.750
 remove the water in this case I the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.660
 I will put directly into a colander 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.010
 so they go cold 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.010
 will remove excess moisture 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.670
 already when they are fully searched and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.850
 dry 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:47.550
 let's start the tasks for what 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.410
 the oil does not jump and we are going to burn 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.610
 well now that we have all this 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.580
 let's leave them 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.580
 cool to adjust them to fry 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.480
 Now what we are going to do is put a 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.490
 frying pan with oil let's heat it up 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.530
 here we already have it hot we are going to 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.780
 add a pinch of salt to avoid 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.970
 that we burn 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.780
 we are going to add little by little 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 our potatoes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.150
 carefully not to burn jazz 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.360
 that more here as you can see I left him 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.140
 the skin or the skin 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:42.140
 since that will help us to have 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 fiber and be healthier this dish 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.910
 We are going to move them a little, we are going to 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:59.010
 add oil on top where they are missing 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.010
 we are going to move them slightly 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.300
 so that they cook perfectly 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.560
 if you wanted to make potatoes the day 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.959
 in the morning or any other day as is 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.959
 as they are they can put them in 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.500
 freezer and the day they need them 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.230
 they can be defrosted and cooked 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.419
 immediate way but if they are going to 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.120
 thaw they have to cook that 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.970
 Same day as yes 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.970
 they do not do it they're going to do this mash 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.880
 here as you can see we already have them 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.260
 perfectly cooked 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:59.210
 What we are going to do now is remove it 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.910
 remove excess oil and put them 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.550
 on absorbent paper towels 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.550
 to remove excess oil 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.930
 and we can add it when it is already 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.630
 this excess we can add a little 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.610
 of salt and pepper if you nothing else 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.240
 they like to tell you nothing else they can 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.240
 add salt 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.810
 here as you can see I already have them in a 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:35.210
 Absorbent paper I will leave you 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.210
 a few seconds 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.870
 and here as you can see friends here and 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.480
 we have our potatoes 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.350
 perfectly cooked 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.310
 They are soft inside and fried by 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.420
 outside 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.620
 crispy on the outside 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.190
 here I recommend that you do not remove 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.730
 the skin or the skin 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.210
