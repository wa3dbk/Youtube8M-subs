00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.230
 hello dear hungry, did you know that 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.970
 The cash flow can also be used as an elephant 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.950
 Laus is called that comes easy 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.380
 because he is actually more of a 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.500
 appendix of the church is on the spot and the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.450
 kesse forest itself is called kaffl and looks 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.740
 paradoxically like a pear 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.570
 but for our purposes this is also 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.430
 no matter because we want one 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.410
 to prepare delicious snack which we 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.660
 then at football or other parties 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.820
 we can offer or feed ourselves 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.880
 Need the caches of course 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.730
 even on spicy paprika sweet curry 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.719
 cayenne pepper salt and as well 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.140
 we need two more eggs 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.910
 more precisely, the egg white of it and just 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 We give this in a suitable vessel 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.739
 add the salt and beat it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.620
 then with the snow business 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.300
 luderitz stiff 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 if that's done , we'll go 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.070
 one half of the snow in another 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.960
 vessel we add the curry powder 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.700
 and stir everything together then 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.550
 let's go with half of the kernels 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.320
 and stir carefully 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.950
 So all caches should be from this one 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.290
 Mix something get to the other 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 half of the beaten egg white 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.160
 We owe the paprika and the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.220
 add cayenne pepper and mix 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.770
 everything again now the other half of the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 he can admit cache and everything again 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.500
 thoroughly mix together 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.690
 We take a baking tray with it 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 baking paper and occupy the one 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.880
 half of it with a variety of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.710
 spiced cashew kernels logically 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.900
 the other species comes to the second 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.760
 half afterwards we distribute the caches 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.530
 to reasonably even on the 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.450
 Baking paper hold the two varieties but 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.860
 separated from each other and then give 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.410
 in the oven at 180 degrees air circulation 160 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 Grad gas would be level 2 to 3 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.060
 Let's pack it for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.890
 ready baked then they see that way 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 We will leave you short 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.920
 cooling down 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.080
 Now we solve that half of the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 baking paper and burning 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.710
 the cashew kernels hang from each other 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 Some will stick together safely 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.240
 When this is done, we will enter it 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.130
 sieve 1 made of metal would be sure yet 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.110
 better suited and shake the caches 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.550
 short in the excess leveling 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 should be solved by it 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.470
 with the second half of the spice cash 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.780
 Then we'll do that as well 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.000
 disconnect again on the paper and disconnect 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.160
 so on and we are already 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.350
 Of course they are also suitable 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.510
 packed as a gift or gift 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.150
 you can do this in a meaningful way , for example 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.610
 Cellophane I wish you much 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.600
 fun in the preparation and at a 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.010
 party and then enjoy your meal 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.050
 if you have another network 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.840
 prefer eg one from chickpeas 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
 or on nachos with whom we even 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.630
 still fit I could know you should 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.850
 with it not missing 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.630
 then just have a look 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.459
 videos into it 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.200
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.200
 next time bye bye
