 Today with you I am Mikhail Demyanenko 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 Recently, it is considered that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.120
 the market has somehow been formed and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 any new brand in default 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 considered Chinese and belong to him with 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.220
 suspicion and we have such feelings i experienced 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 when got on qumo quest test 570 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 in fact, qumo was 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 founded in 2002 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.990
 joint project of 5 largest 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.030
 south korean flash mp3 producers 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 guide picking narrow lines in korea 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 China Hong Kong and Taiwan 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 box except the smartphone itself 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.200
 revealed a couple of pleasant surprises in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.469
 first there is no spare battery 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.489
 capacity of 3200 milliampere hour in the second 2 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 back panel plain and protective case 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.539
 that will not worry scratches 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.660
 on the glass device dimensions are large and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.160
 similar in meaning to e-books 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.619
 16 by eight and a half centimeters 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.930
 but the display diagonal is 5.7 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.030
 inches on it is very comfortable to watch 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.040
 movies on the road at the bottom of the microphone 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.600
 and microus connector on the right side 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
 volume rocker and button 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 inclusions 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 despite the size of the device they 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.380
 lie strictly under the thumb and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.090
 it is convenient to use them 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.570
 top connector 35 nicks on the back 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.710
 side 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 flashlight and highly sensitive microphone 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.710
 And for shooting video, by the way, he writes 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 clean even at long distance 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.000
 below the only speaker such a screen 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 of course I would like a stereo 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.829
 but the sound is still not the worst 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 smartphone works with two sim cards but 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.990
 only one of them can work format 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 Prezhe display with a resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 pixels 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.600
 320 pixel density for money 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.370
 thanks to which the picture is juicy 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.050
 display color rendition 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.460
 which is the only problem prints 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.970
 fingers which he is very fast 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.700
 gets covered 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.370
 cortex a9 dual core air processor with 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 a clock frequency of 1 2 gigahertz is not 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.220
 allows you to work comfortably with 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.710
 the device is very slow 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.330
 often even typing on the screen 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.470
 appears later something about and you type 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.800
 physically on the keyboard 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.170
 but with a toy is not quite a problem 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.560
 see for yourself it's pretty simple 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.850
 example 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.380
 on more advanced it hurts to look 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.060
 Okay, not everyone likes to drive to the shooters 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 decided to put text chess 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.350
 editor and contact and what do you think 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.390
 after installing the second sentence he 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.860
 wrote that not enough to me besides 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 that he has one gigabyte of operative 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.630
 memory and 4 GB of internal flash memory 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200
 + micro sd memory card slot up to 32 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.280
 gigabyte 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.530
 see and all memory is used 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.510
 operating system android 4 1 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.460
 exactly a cute shell turned off 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.620
 three-dimensional selection of screens look like 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 that once stood on rover smartphones 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.060
 if someone remembers their set 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.890
 offers similar services that Yandex 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.870
 access to which it should be remembered 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.280
 need internet access even though i'm with 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.080
 habits constantly wandered around 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.480
 infinite not finding me . did not have 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.520
 need because control buttons 4 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.110
 they are 3 and they are not familiar 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.030
 gps navigation is 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.760
 but satellites model rocks like in 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.560
 telescope more than 15 minutes and think too 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.570
 slowly does not even have time for my step 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.820
 in the car, I just would not take 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.680
 sand chamber as the only thing 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.090
 happy u depth of field autofocus and 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.370
 follow-up opportunities 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.230
 picture battery barely enough for 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.140
 12 hours with not very large load 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.720
 first understand why barely so to whom 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.330
 maybe itâ€™s good for those who grew up 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.800
 from toys not very talkative but 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.470

 patch set can be found completely for others 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.530
