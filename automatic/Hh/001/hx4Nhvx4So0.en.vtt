00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
you know the closed position doesn't

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.179 
you know the closed position doesn't
work<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:09.479> M&amp;P<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> spring<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
work to M&amp;P it's got the spring and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.300 
work to M&amp;P it's got the spring and
syslog<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.560> put<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:15.290> open<00:01:16.310> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
syslog so you just put it and open you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
syslog so you just put it and open you
can<00:01:17.460> touch<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.479> open<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> by

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
can touch this so you can open it by

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
can touch this so you can open it by
here<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.759> push<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> button<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> opens

here just push this button and it opens
pretty<00:01:23.490> quick<00:01:23.700> almost<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> switchblade

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
pretty quick almost like a switchblade

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
pretty quick almost like a switchblade
it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.670> considered<00:01:27.119> especially<00:01:30.500> as<00:01:31.500> far<00:01:31.530> as

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it's not considered especially as far as

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's not considered especially as far as
ease<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> opening<00:01:32.610> goes<00:01:34.549> let's<00:01:35.549> give<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
ease of opening goes let's give it to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.770 
ease of opening goes let's give it to
the<00:01:36.150> MP<00:01:39.200> now<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> blade<00:01:41.540> blade<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the MP now the blade blade in the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:54.950 
the MP now the blade blade in the
Spyderco<00:01:44.930> stainless<00:01:45.930> steel<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:51.680> yeah<00:01:53.479> 8<00:01:54.479> CR

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
Spyderco stainless steel it's yeah 8 CR

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.459 
Spyderco stainless steel it's yeah 8 CR
13<00:01:55.680> mov<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:58.350> got<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> decent<00:01:58.740> blade<00:02:00.469> it's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
13 mov it's got a decent blade it's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.380 
13 mov it's got a decent blade it's
non-serrated<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.759> means<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.240> probably

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
non-serrated which means it's probably

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.740 
non-serrated which means it's probably
easier<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> sharpen<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.680> me<00:02:04.829> anyways<00:02:05.750> real

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
easier to sharpen for me anyways real

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.309 
easier to sharpen for me anyways real
sharp<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> box<00:02:08.629> pretty<00:02:09.629> thin<00:02:10.020> but

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
sharp out of the box pretty thin but

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.869 
sharp out of the box pretty thin but
definitely<00:02:10.739> thick<00:02:10.950> enough<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.520> used<00:02:11.730> as

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
definitely thick enough to be used as

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.040 
definitely thick enough to be used as
the<00:02:12.000> utility<00:02:12.480> blade

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the utility blade

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.350 
the utility blade
I<00:02:14.090> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.300> stick<00:02:16.820> as<00:02:17.820> far<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
I kind of like it stick as far as the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.630 
I kind of like it stick as far as the
width<00:02:18.540> goes<00:02:21.500> blade<00:02:22.500> me<00:02:22.770> M&amp;P<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:25.430> little<00:02:26.430> more

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
width goes blade me M&amp;P a little more

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.560

intimidating looking as that Ryan out a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.510 
intimidating looking as that Ryan out a
look<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.020> it

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
look to it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.030 
look to it
kinda<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> rhino's<00:02:33.090> horn<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.860> also

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
kinda like a rhino's horn and it's also

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.270 
kinda like a rhino's horn and it's also
got<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> serration<00:02:36.710> pretty<00:02:37.710> sharp<00:02:38.040> out<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
got a serration pretty sharp out of the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.010 
got a serration pretty sharp out of the
box<00:02:38.490> but<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.850> gotta<00:02:39.090> say<00:02:39.240> it's<00:02:39.390> spider<00:02:39.630> good<00:02:39.900> as

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
box but I gotta say it's spider good as

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.960 
box but I gotta say it's spider good as
a<00:02:40.050> little<00:02:40.260> bit<00:02:40.320> sharper<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.850> is

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
a little bit sharper and this is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
a little bit sharper and this is
definitely<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.480> more<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.780> bitch<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.200> sharpen

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
definitely be more of a bitch to sharpen

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.940 
definitely be more of a bitch to sharpen
because<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.700> got<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.590> divot<00:02:46.590> right

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
because it's got this little divot right

and<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.400> 33<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.590> not<00:04:53.770> very<00:04:54.010> expensive

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
and this is 33 so not very expensive

and this is 33 so not very expensive
they're<00:04:54.730> markdowns<00:04:55.210> like<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.810> MSRP<00:04:56.230> is<00:04:56.440> 54

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
they're markdowns like the MSRP is 54

so it's not very expensive I mean it's

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.030 
so it's not very expensive I mean it's
not<00:05:06.490> like<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.870> benchmark<00:05:07.870> or<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.169> Chris<00:05:08.710> Reeves

not like a benchmark or a Chris Reeves

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.490

you said they're both real close and

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.710 
you said they're both real close and
quality<00:06:52.100> so<00:06:52.310> you<00:06:52.370> got<00:06:52.610> yourself<00:06:52.730> a<00:06:53.180> Ford<00:06:53.570> and

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
quality so you got yourself a Ford and

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.440 
quality so you got yourself a Ford and
Chevy<00:06:54.080> debate<00:06:54.500> as<00:06:55.490> far<00:06:55.790> as<00:06:55.940> which<00:06:56.120> one<00:06:56.330> is

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
Chevy debate as far as which one is

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.920 
Chevy debate as far as which one is
better

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
better

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.180 
better
really<00:06:57.200> all<00:06:57.350> comes<00:06:57.620> down<00:06:57.740> to<00:06:57.860> personal

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
really all comes down to personal

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.000 
really all comes down to personal
preference<00:06:58.670> I<00:06:59.060> say<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.080> biggest<00:07:00.380> factor

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
preference I say the biggest factor

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.290 
preference I say the biggest factor
would<00:07:01.820> be<00:07:01.880> weight<00:07:02.620> because<00:07:03.620> the<00:07:03.920> weight<00:07:03.950> is

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
would be weight because the weight is

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.070 
would be weight because the weight is
significantly<00:07:05.300> different<00:07:05.510> this<00:07:05.900> is

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
significantly different this is

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.230 
significantly different this is
definitely<00:07:06.500> heavier<00:07:06.980> than<00:07:07.190> Spyderco<00:07:09.610> so<00:07:10.610> it's

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
definitely heavier than Spyderco so it's

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.060 
definitely heavier than Spyderco so it's
about<00:07:11.450> it

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
about it

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.070 
about it
