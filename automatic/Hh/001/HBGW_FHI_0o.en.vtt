00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.349
 good afternoon everyone, plumbing installation video 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.500
 it is a bathroom with soot as input and here 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 Now the first to say so fitting 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 place first what was done here 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 here is the sewer riser itself we are gone 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 to the left 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 a tap of the top rose degrees like 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 visible and below we did 45 wanted 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.300
 would be up here under 45 but failed 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.379
 because as a boler already press under 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.239
 the top is us the last floor 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.239
 therefore it is clean as a fun pipe 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.020
 Some feces here will not merge 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 further right side will be placed 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 ventilation and won as we see boler 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 write it literally grind in between 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.699
 air conditioner secretly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.809
 and the air ducts further we will leave with 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 rectangular 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.670
 resort here for such a hole round 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.299
 an adapter of such flour from a rectangular 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.299
 on steep 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.909
 somewhere bought and now my 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.680
 determination to do first here 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.500
 We encountered a small problem 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.829
 we need to digest from the water on 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.350
 a towel was a customer here such 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.380
 crane and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.829
 day a quarter and we wanted to leave in 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.049
 side in god through the wall inch 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.659
 cranes 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.100
 the guys who came were promised welders 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.380
 color digest do we something and when 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 already turned off the water they started to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.189
 the work said no we can not pipe 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.670
 close to the wall 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.100
 cook and that's what we had in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.030
 storeroom screens provided direct 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.560
 and we according to art 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.560
 Now we have a little group changed 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 Now I can change my appetite a little 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.900
 were alone now they have changed 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.600
 crane from the direct network put attack 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.810
 corner option because snuggle 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.380
 closer to the wall otherwise here we are all 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.740
 the design will interfere means that we 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.670
 want to do it here first we took 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.360
 a group that we usually will pour 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.620
 from the boiler immediately down the drain like this 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.690
 us and the kidneys here for plum stand drunk 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.560
 higher we fall then so simple worker 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.980
 such a process 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.560
 but then it was overplayed and the customer 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.260
 insisted that water not be drained 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.530
 sewer all system 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.750
 that is why now we will be a little bit 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.600
 replay that rock band old and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.600
 put aside now after 3 annual 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.290
 the circle is such an interesting variation and we 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:20.350
 this will link here means us 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.350
 what happens with just meeting water 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.480
 wealthy person 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.230
 notes1 winter screen on the towel below 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.989
 the second 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:36.709
 and here is the water supply and here it is 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.030
 hot you bottom appliances everything stands on the floor 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.910
 in. he stole 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.049
 further threatened you cheeks in apothecary with 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:50.230
 Neptune leakage protection magnet and 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:53.090
 further down the course means us braces 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.720
 new water line filter 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.350
 enters us half an inch and more like 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.310
 usually here 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.510
 protection against water hammer from the collector we 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.970
 refused this time we will not mount 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.970
 and here she went further 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:14.780
 we have a hot lyre 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:19.470
 here we are a tap at the entrance and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 normal club to boot pain come 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.979
 because of us somewhere here by 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.229
 height 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.590
 the outlet tube itself from this 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.800
 hot water 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.190
 as soon as it goes down the water comes in 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.940
 air through this valve and some water is easy 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:47.970
 breaks down the system is somewhere else 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:51.500
 so it may come a little higher like that and that 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.880
 here we have plus rams back 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.169
 cold water riser means bottom there 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.020
 light on the evening tube and then sharply 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.220
 goes on the shelf to him that is goes 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.800
 the filing here is the bottom of the Vikings here a tap 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.449
 alternately remade I and everything 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:21.349
 the system went and in distributing us bombs to 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.349
 feel their way out 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.099
 again we decided to do it 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:31.740
 brass hard to get around 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.490
 extension cords and this we are now we 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.099
 to customize 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.099
 but first thing now we will consolidate ethics 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:42.599
 from cubes 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:45.690
 stand under the eyes of Russia does not rely 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.169
 will let the workflow begin as 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.199
 the rule 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:54.570
 how to make the right decision about 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:58.199
 easiest but from this and easy solution 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.360
 sometimes hard to find him and usually tried 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:04.620
 we type some groups we mount 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.009
 on the wall as you can compare so costume 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:12.690
 fit to man so also here 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:14.270
 we put the device we adjust under the size here 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.960
 this niche is permissible 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.700
 node somewhere is placed appliances 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.210
 the premises are a chance faster installation 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:31.840
 what happens then we will show for now 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:37.840
 the outline of the private goes to a creative project 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:43.990
 thinking so far the idea is all in my head 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.990
 interest exchange all thanks with
