00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 we show you how delicious you are today 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.450
 popcorn easily and quickly yourself 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.309
 can make the recipe with the exact 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.559
 quantity information is in the infobox under 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 linked to this video or you will find it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.710
 on American kochen.de as 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.160
 First, oil is pop with a few grains 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 corn corn heated at medium level 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 when the corn kernels are pumped up 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.840
 the pot taken from the stove and the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 remaining mostly evenly on the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.460
 pot soil spread after about one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.380
 half corn every corn kernel have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.700
 same temperature and the pot can 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.700
 back to the hot plate 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 It is important that all corn kernels 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.930
 be heated evenly so they 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 relatively soon to start bursting 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 That's why the pot should always be 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 something to cool with the popcorn 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.059
 not afterwards by the whole kitchen 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.600
 A cover should definitely be flying 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600
 the pot 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.509
 when the noise of bursting 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 corn kernels can worsen the pot of 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.340
 be taken when your popcorn 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.930
 like nature like it could be 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.490
 we'll show you one more now 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490
 salty and sweet variety 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.020
 sometimes it's just a bit of butter 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.360
 and dribble it over the popcorn 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.400
 after that, either salt or something 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.400
 powdered sugar over it and mixed well 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.240
 We wish you a lot of fun 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.240
