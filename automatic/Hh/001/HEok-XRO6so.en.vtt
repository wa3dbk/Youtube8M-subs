00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
sword going to get out of the way

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.860 
sword going to get out of the way
because<00:03:30.580> then<00:03:30.790> I'm<00:03:30.910> probably<00:03:31.060> going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.660> build

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
because then I'm probably going to build

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.710 
because then I'm probably going to build
this<00:03:32.020> weird<00:03:32.260> neck<00:03:32.530> thing<00:03:32.710> for<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.390> um<00:03:34.390> so

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
this weird neck thing for you um so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.340 
this weird neck thing for you um so
let's<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:34.960> ahead<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.110> do<00:03:35.260> that

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:53.190 

you<00:03:44.350> can<00:03:44.470> see<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.650> light<00:03:44.770> up<00:03:44.890> there<00:03:51.690> okay<00:03:52.690> and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
you can see the light up there okay and

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.410 
you can see the light up there okay and
now<00:03:53.440> we<00:03:53.500> will<00:03:53.920> do<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.160> wizard<00:03:54.700> sword<00:03:54.970> gun<00:03:55.150> and
