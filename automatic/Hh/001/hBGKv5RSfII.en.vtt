doing where I don't actually get to keep
the<00:00:36.899> product<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.610> we'll<00:00:38.610> see<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.910> goes

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the product so we'll see how it goes

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.840 
the product so we'll see how it goes
it's<00:00:39.719> interesting<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> whole<00:00:40.800> 4k<00:00:41.280> aspect

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
it's interesting but the whole 4k aspect

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
it's interesting but the whole 4k aspect
and<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> fact<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.750> has<00:00:43.020> HDMI

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and the fact that it actually has HDMI

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.490 
and the fact that it actually has HDMI
where<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> EMI<00:00:45.239> 2.0<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.050> apparently<00:00:46.260> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
where is it EMI 2.0 which apparently is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.880 
where is it EMI 2.0 which apparently is
the<00:00:46.710> first<00:00:47.000> 4k<00:00:48.000> display<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> don't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the first 4k display to have I don't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.689 
the first 4k display to have I don't
know<00:00:49.950> something<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> read<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.840> I

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
know something like that I read it but I

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
know something like that I read it but I
really<00:00:53.699> dabbled<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> 4k<00:00:54.989> realm<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.710> much

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
really dabbled in the 4k realm as much

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
really dabbled in the 4k realm as much
as<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.780> my

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
as I would like so this is gonna be my

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
as I would like so this is gonna be my
first<00:00:58.440> actual<00:00:59.100> test<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.879> 4k<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.359> we'll<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.750> how

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
first actual test at 4k so we'll see how

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.189 
first actual test at 4k so we'll see how
it<00:01:00.989> goes

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it goes

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
it goes
look<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.010> similar<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.640> look<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
look how it's similar those look the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
look how it's similar those look the
only<00:01:03.329> difference<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.199> stand<00:01:04.470> which

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
only difference is the stand which

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
only difference is the stand which
obviously<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> can't<00:01:05.489> even<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
obviously you can't even see because I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
obviously you can't even see because I
don't<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> stands<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
don't have the stands on but this is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
don't have the stands on but this is
very<00:01:08.430> unique<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> side<00:01:09.890> but

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
very unique it's off to the side but

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
very unique it's off to the side but
yeah<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.760> we'll<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> turns

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
yeah I don't know we'll see how it turns

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
yeah I don't know we'll see how it turns
out<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.260> first<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:13.770> using<00:01:13.830> 4k<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
out this is my first time using 4k and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.039 
out this is my first time using 4k and
it's<00:01:14.970> funny<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.420> opened<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's funny because I opened up the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's funny because I opened up the
display<00:01:16.650> preference<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> bodega<00:01:18.000> Russo

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I could you know adjust the resolution

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
small on the screen by I can actually

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.899 
small on the screen by I can actually
read<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.600> pretty<00:01:36.960> clear<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:38.100> let's<00:01:38.790> see

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
read it pretty clear so let's let's see

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
read it pretty clear so let's let's see
if<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.439> it's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
if we can do about that so so it's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.810 
if we can do about that so so it's
looking<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:40.950> crazy<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.490> five

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
looking a little crazy with five

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.109 
looking a little crazy with five
displays<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.159> but<00:01:44.159> yeah<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.939> I'm

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
displays going on but yeah I think I'm

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.310 
displays going on but yeah I think I'm
gonna<00:01:45.240> actually<00:01:45.450> switch<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
gonna actually switch it out for the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.039 
gonna actually switch it out for the
DisplayPort<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.270> wanted<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.600> plug

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
DisplayPort I really wanted to just plug

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.359 
DisplayPort I really wanted to just plug
it<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.380> Mac<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.070> make<00:01:50.220> my

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it into my Mac because it would make my

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.300 
it into my Mac because it would make my
life<00:01:50.399> easier<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:52.229> obviously<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.159> doesn't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
life easier but obviously it doesn't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.740 
life easier but obviously it doesn't
have<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.610> actual<00:01:53.820> display<00:01:54.149> port<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.479> only<00:01:54.600> has

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
have an actual display port it only has

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
have an actual display port it only has
mini<00:01:54.990> display<00:01:55.320> board<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> plug

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
mini display board so would have to plug

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149 
mini display board so would have to plug
it<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it into this but it's like there and I

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
it into this but it's like there and I
have<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.460> into<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> whole

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
have to get into that it's it's a whole

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.760 
have to get into that it's it's a whole
thing<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.259> figure<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:01.530> how<00:02:01.649> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
thing so I'm gonna figure out how I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.899 
thing so I'm gonna figure out how I'm
gonna<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.219> don't<00:02:02.399> wanna<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.729> now

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
gonna do that I don't wanna do it now

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
gonna do that I don't wanna do it now
because<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.270> late<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.570> night<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.200> work

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
because it's late at night not I work

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
because it's late at night not I work
all<00:02:04.860> day<00:02:05.009> tomorrow<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> day<00:02:05.729> after<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.390> I'm

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
all day tomorrow on the day after so I'm

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.449 
all day tomorrow on the day after so I'm
gonna<00:02:07.439> figure<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> cord<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
gonna figure that out and the cord that

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.309 
gonna figure that out and the cord that
get<00:02:08.580> me<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.179> super<00:02:09.509> short<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.289> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
get me is super short I do have a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.500 
get me is super short I do have a
DisplayPort<00:02:10.890> hooked<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:12.090> display

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
DisplayPort hooked up to this display

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
DisplayPort hooked up to this display
but<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.110> think

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
but it's I think

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
but it's I think
like<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> same<00:02:13.830> length<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.550> south<00:02:15.030> I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
like the same length as this one south I

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
like the same length as this one south I
don't<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.870> dilemma<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:17.010> main

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
don't know dilemma I think my main

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.170 
don't know dilemma I think my main
problem<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.240> am<00:02:18.930> looking<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.070> hard<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
problem is that I am looking so hard to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.630 
problem is that I am looking so hard to
finding<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> differences<00:02:22.380> from<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.770> 1080p<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
finding the differences from a 1080p to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.290 
finding the differences from a 1080p to
the<00:02:23.820> 4k<00:02:24.300> IPs<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.940> it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the 4k IPs and it's just it's not it's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.680 
the 4k IPs and it's just it's not it's
not<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:28.200> oh<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:28.770> gosh<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.570> is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
not like oh my gosh what is that that is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
not like oh my gosh what is that that is
insane<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:32.040> still<00:02:32.280> trying<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.550> figure<00:02:32.760> out

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
insane so I'm still trying to figure out

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.630 
insane so I'm still trying to figure out
what<00:02:33.690> makes<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.260> awesome<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.190> mean<00:02:35.550> it's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
what makes it so awesome but I mean it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400 
what makes it so awesome but I mean it's
it's<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.940> kick-ass<00:02:36.240> display<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.110> really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's a kick-ass display but I really

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.960 
it's a kick-ass display but I really
need<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.980> wish<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.460> could<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.670> swap

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
need to like I wish I could just swap

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.030 
need to like I wish I could just swap
out<00:02:39.240> one<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.480> these<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.960> use<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.680> 60

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
out one of these and use it for the 60

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.070 
out one of these and use it for the 60
days<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.820> how<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.630> feel<00:02:42.780> about<00:02:42.930> it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
days and see how I really feel about it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
days and see how I really feel about it
but<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.620> wish<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.550> can't<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.060> not

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
but I wish I can't do that it's not

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.130 
but I wish I can't do that it's not
gonna<00:02:45.270> work<00:02:45.450> out<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:45.840> gonna<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.050> to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
gonna work out so I'm gonna have to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.860 
gonna work out so I'm gonna have to
figure<00:02:46.320> out<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> workflow<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:48.240> really<00:02:48.450> test<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
figure out a workflow to really test it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.690 
figure out a workflow to really test it
out<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.230> I'll<00:02:49.470> probably<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.890> I'm<00:02:50.520> like

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
out and I'll probably do that I'm like

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
out and I'll probably do that I'm like
Monday<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.060> Tuesday<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.570> yeah<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.680> just<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
Monday or Tuesday so yeah this is just a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
Monday or Tuesday so yeah this is just a
little<00:02:53.220> pit<00:02:53.850> mat<00:02:54.030> setup<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.570> should<00:02:54.720> also

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
little pit mat setup I should also

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.180 
little pit mat setup I should also
mention<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> styrofoam<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
mention that all the styrofoam and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680 
mention that all the styrofoam and
everything<00:02:56.460> like<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.730> inside<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.540> all

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
everything like that inside was all

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.660 
everything like that inside was all
broken<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.470> hopefully<00:02:58.800> when<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> send<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.490> back

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
broken so hopefully when I send it back

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.820 
broken so hopefully when I send it back
I<00:02:59.880> don't<00:03:00.210> get<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.540> trouble<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:01.320> mean<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.680> was

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
I don't get in trouble I mean it was

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.500 
I don't get in trouble I mean it was
like<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.400> box<00:03:02.640> was<00:03:02.880> all<00:03:03.000> beating<00:03:03.270> up<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
like just the box was all beating up the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.540 
like just the box was all beating up the
styrofoam<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.710> know<00:03:04.830> in<00:03:05.040> pieces<00:03:05.520> so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
styrofoam was all you know in pieces so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.970 
styrofoam was all you know in pieces so
hopefully<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.990> could<00:03:07.260> actually<00:03:07.590> wrap<00:03:07.800> it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
hopefully one I could actually wrap it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.490 
hopefully one I could actually wrap it
back<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.490> two<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:09.990> blamed<00:03:10.290> for

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
back up and two I don't get blamed for

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.140 
back up and two I don't get blamed for
anything<00:03:10.710> but<00:03:11.250> whatever<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.910> know<00:03:12.030> what

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
anything but whatever you know what

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.460 
anything but whatever you know what
would<00:03:12.240> make<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.570> look<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.930> lot<00:03:13.050> cooler

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
would make this look a lot cooler

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.160 
would make this look a lot cooler
maybe<00:03:13.980> LEDs<00:03:14.460> yeah<00:03:15.030> yeah<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:15.480> LEDs<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
maybe LEDs yeah yeah I think LEDs I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
maybe LEDs yeah yeah I think LEDs I
guess<00:03:16.440> I'll<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.650> finish<00:03:17.130> up<00:03:17.430> by<00:03:17.580> talking

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
guess I'll just finish up by talking

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.990 
guess I'll just finish up by talking
about<00:03:18.050> cable<00:03:19.050> management<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.850> one

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
about cable management so that's the one

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.870 
about cable management so that's the one
thing<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.510> saw<00:03:21.900> some<00:03:22.200> people<00:03:22.320> say<00:03:22.770> oh<00:03:22.980> my<00:03:23.340> god<00:03:23.640> my

is going to go and then cable manage it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.050 
is going to go and then cable manage it
the<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.100> thing<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:35.310> waiting<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:35.610> right<00:03:35.910> now

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.520 
is figuring out - scarlet I don't know
what<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> buzz<00:03:38.910> blaze<00:03:39.210> is<00:03:39.480> cuz<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.110> length<00:03:40.320> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
what the buzz blaze is cuz the length of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.100 
what the buzz blaze is cuz the length of
the<00:03:40.590> XLR<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.100> it's<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.150> whole<00:03:42.300> thing<00:03:42.570> once

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
time to sit down and think about it I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.800 
time to sit down and think about it I
will<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.460> position<00:03:47.940> plugged<00:03:48.330> in<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
will get that position plugged in and

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.420 
will get that position plugged in and
test<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.230> out<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.350> see<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.740> want<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.100> keep<00:03:50.220> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
test it out to see if I want to keep it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.250 
test it out to see if I want to keep it
in<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.360> setup<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.750> whole<00:03:51.870> time

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
in the setup the whole time

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.250 
in the setup the whole time
and<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.710> do<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:53.370> everything<00:03:53.520> goes<00:03:53.760> good

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and if I do and everything goes good

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
and if I do and everything goes good
then<00:03:55.700> that's<00:03:56.700> when<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:56.940> will<00:03:57.060> finish<00:03:57.330> up<00:03:57.630> with

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
then that's when I will finish up with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420 
then that's when I will finish up with

with that but I hope you guys understand

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220 
with that but I hope you guys understand
that<00:03:59.550> that's<00:03:59.700> that's<00:04:00.060> not<00:04:00.300> hard<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.960> that's

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
that that's that's not hard to do that's

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.960 
that that's that's not hard to do that's
that's<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:01.950> bunching<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.490> cables<00:04:02.820> up

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
that's just bunching the cables up

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.010 
that's just bunching the cables up
keeping<00:04:03.270> them<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.510> straight<00:04:03.690> line<00:04:03.720> and

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
keeping them in a straight line and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.900 
keeping them in a straight line and
putting<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> excess<00:04:04.680> into<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.430> Signum<00:04:05.790> which

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
putting the excess into the Signum which

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.520 
putting the excess into the Signum which
already<00:04:06.030> has<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.540> lot<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.720> stuff<00:04:06.960> in<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.170> and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530
