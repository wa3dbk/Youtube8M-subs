to<00:00:11.730> me<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:12.509> interesting<00:00:12.929> number

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to me that are really interesting number

one<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.370> fact<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.639> sneaky<00:00:15.030> randomly<00:00:15.420> pulled

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
one the fact that sneaky randomly pulled

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.790

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
out cork it not randomly but he pulled

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.890 
out cork it not randomly but he pulled
out<00:00:16.859> quirky<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.279> third<00:00:17.490> game<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.910> expected

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
out quirky in the third game I expected

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.029 
out quirky in the third game I expected
because<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:19.529> two<00:00:19.650> games<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.980> he

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
because of the first two games that he

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.070 
because of the first two games that he

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
didn't even play Corki it was really

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500 
didn't even play Corki it was really
strange<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.500> he<00:00:22.560> would<00:00:23.180> essentially<00:00:24.180> change

that early again because cyanide managed

that early again because cyanide managed
to<00:01:27.810> pick<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.170> double<00:01:28.590> kill<00:01:28.799> off<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to pick up a double kill off to the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.710 
to pick up a double kill off to the
first<00:01:29.520> blood<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.150> managed<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> pick<00:01:30.630> up

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
first blood and then managed to pick up

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
first blood and then managed to pick up
a<00:01:30.810> third<00:01:31.140> kill<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.430> anxious

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a third kill and I was a little anxious

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
a third kill and I was a little anxious
because<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.320> kills<00:01:34.619> he

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
because even with the three kills he

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
because even with the three kills he
wasn't<00:01:35.610> farming<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> jungle<00:01:36.420> meteor<00:01:36.750> still

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
media says jungle while he still had

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.069 
media says jungle while he still had
smite<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.390> predictable<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.960> he

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
smite which was pretty predictable as he

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
smite which was pretty predictable as he
got<00:01:46.200> helped<00:01:46.409> by<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> bot<00:01:46.979> lane<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> he<00:01:47.790> could

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
got helped by the bot lane and he could

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
got helped by the bot lane and he could
save<00:01:48.119> his<00:01:48.240> smite<00:01:48.509> cyanide<00:01:49.140> should<00:01:49.290> have

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
save his smite cyanide should have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.600 
save his smite cyanide should have
actually<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.770> he<00:01:49.950> bought<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> mattress<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually just he bought a mattress so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.980 
actually just he bought a mattress so
you<00:01:50.670> should<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.030> went<00:01:51.420> around<00:01:51.570> clean

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you should have just went around clean

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.359 
you should have just went around clean
his<00:01:52.110> jungle<00:01:52.350> went<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> quick<00:01:52.920> level<00:01:53.159> five

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
his jungle went to a quick level five

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
his jungle went to a quick level five
and<00:01:53.399> he<00:01:53.640> could<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.850> snuck<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.110> dragon<00:01:55.110> really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and he could have snuck a dragon really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
and he could have snuck a dragon really
easily<00:01:55.950> alone<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.939> cyanide<00:01:57.420> goes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
easily alone I like that cyanide goes

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.789 
easily alone I like that cyanide goes
for<00:01:57.780> gangs<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.170> pressure<00:01:58.350> especially

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
for gangs for pressure especially

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
for gangs for pressure especially
against<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> farm<00:01:59.579> heavy<00:01:59.790> meat<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> jungle

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
against the farm heavy meat a jungle

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
against the farm heavy meat a jungle
like<00:02:00.689> videos<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.110> think<00:02:01.320> there's<00:02:01.469> as

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
like videos but I think there's as

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.020 
like videos but I think there's as
double<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.189> told<00:02:02.369> me<00:02:02.460> during<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> game<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
double have told me during the game you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
double have told me during the game you
need<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> find<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.840> balance<00:02:04.020> between<00:02:04.520> farming

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
need to find a balance between farming

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
need to find a balance between farming
too<00:02:05.610> much<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> ganking<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.840> sign<00:02:07.020> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
too much and ganking and I think sign I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.300 
too much and ganking and I think sign I
went<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.350> little<00:02:07.530> bit<00:02:07.680> too<00:02:07.799> heavy<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> gank

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
went a little bit too heavy on the gank

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.609 
went a little bit too heavy on the gank
inside<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.959> sign<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.440> did

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
inside and and the thing that sign I did

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.949 
inside and and the thing that sign I did
well<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.069> flat<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.030> said<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> time<00:02:12.750> bomb

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
I did well as he ganked bottom really

I did well as he ganked bottom really
smartly<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.380> feel<00:02:25.620> like<00:02:25.709> balls<00:02:25.980> his<00:02:26.250> tides<00:02:26.489> of

blood<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:26.970> showed<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.569> leeson<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.410> in

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
blood actually showed that leeson was in

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.930 
blood actually showed that leeson was in
the<00:02:28.560> brush<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:28.890> he<00:02:28.950> didn't<00:02:29.190> notice<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.670> he

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the brush but he didn't notice and he

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.309 
the brush but he didn't notice and he
still<00:02:30.000> ended<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.510> dying<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.989> gank<00:02:31.170> and

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
still ended up dying to that gank and

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.270 
still ended up dying to that gank and
that's<00:02:31.470> what<00:02:31.620> really<00:02:31.800> swung<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> game

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that's what really swung the game

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.949 
that's what really swung the game
because<00:02:32.519> if<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:33.060> gonna<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.450> drag<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.780> game

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
because if I'm gonna just drag this game

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.390 
because if I'm gonna just drag this game
out<00:02:33.989> which<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.410> uncharacteristic<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.130> them<00:02:35.250> if

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
out which is uncharacteristic of them if

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.009 
out which is uncharacteristic of them if
they<00:02:35.489> dragged<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.000> 20<00:02:36.209> minutes<00:02:36.450> nobody

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019
