00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello when we use our 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.210
 tablet computers or even when 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.400
 We access the internet by cellphone. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.099
 perhaps we can not even imagine how 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.900
 computers evolved in today's class 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.179
 you follow a timeline about 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.400
 the evolution of the operating system and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.830
 also of computer architecture and there 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 prepared for a trip in time 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 the first phase from 1945 to 1955 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.900
 of 1940 the first 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 computers that used valves and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.440
 programming panels, programming was 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 made by panels through wires 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 used the machine language and still 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.910
 there was no system concept 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:50.160
 operating second phase from 1956 to 1965 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 the computer used transistors and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 batch systems 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 this time there is also an increase in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.960
 higher capacity 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.859
 computers were 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.750
 minors 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 the automation of tasks that were 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.880
 were manual and the emergence of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.830
 Early programming language 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 assembly and force in the third phase of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 1966 to 1980 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 the computer used circuits 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 integrated 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 there was an increase in the power of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 processing processor evolution and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.829
 in Memory Partitioning the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 Multiprogramming Fourth Phase from 1987 to 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.930
 nineteen ninety 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.140
 at this time computers 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.530
 personnel and the work stations had 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 competing task executions 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 multitasking more processors and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.310
 implementation of programs simultaneously 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 fifth phase from 1991 to present day 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.030
 we perceive a hardware advance 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 software applications and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 telecommunication the greater capacity of 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.110
 processing and storage in addition to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.110
 compact models like tablets
