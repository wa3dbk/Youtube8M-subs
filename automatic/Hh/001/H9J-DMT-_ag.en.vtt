 in this version of the simplified music we 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.650
 no eyelashes and easy chords 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.620
 for you then the chords are like this 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.150
 other rhythm suggestions to let the

 pretty cool music 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
 Good if you have difficulty in pacing. 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.410
 of the complete is just to use the same chords 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.600

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.830

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.340
 to start the video to train 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.100
 with me 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.140
 there the rhythm pattern has three 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.840
 smaller parts and it will be used to 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.820
 all the chords of the beauty song 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 Let's start with the smaller one for you. 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.180
 train 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.099
 in the first part of the rhythm let's play 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.099
 once down 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 the second and third equal parts 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.879
 We're gonna play it down by hitting the hand. 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.670
 on the ropes 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:50.190
 Look what I do is let the three of you. 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.680
 index and middle fingers pass there 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.769
 by the ropes and then I'll arrive with 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.830
 the thumb drowning the strings make a 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.970
 so the movement of rotation is cool to 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.970
 give the percussive effect 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:10.620
 We'll play up then. 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.739
 I use the outside part of the nail 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.739
 thumb 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:25.220
 so it stayed and now it 's just repeating the people 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.330
 repeat the second part to make the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.330
 third equal yes 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.080
 And now you're going to play for all 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.990

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.780
 sertanejo and sometimes in the rock 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.550

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.540

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.190
