shot<00:00:06.060> basically<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.379> like<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> start<00:00:08.250> out<00:00:08.460> with

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
shot basically I like to start out with

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.140 
shot basically I like to start out with
eight<00:00:09.480> or<00:00:09.870> six<00:00:10.200> pound<00:00:10.380> fluorocarbon<00:00:10.650> line<00:00:11.150> you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
eight or six pound fluorocarbon line you

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.549 
eight or six pound fluorocarbon line you
know<00:00:12.269> anything<00:00:12.780> much<00:00:12.929> more<00:00:12.960> than<00:00:13.349> an<00:00:13.410> eight

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
know anything much more than an eight

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.079 
know anything much more than an eight
pound<00:00:13.740> line<00:00:13.980> becomes<00:00:14.340> extremely<00:00:14.790> hard<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pound line becomes extremely hard to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330 
pound line becomes extremely hard to
manage<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> spinning<00:00:15.780> reel<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> six<00:00:17.250> or

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
manage on a spinning reel so six or

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.060 
manage on a spinning reel so six or
eight<00:00:17.430> pound<00:00:17.640> line<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.090> use<00:00:18.180> Seaguar<00:00:18.779> in

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
eight pound line I use Seaguar in

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.929 
eight pound line I use Seaguar in
physics<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.760> works<00:00:20.939> well<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.150> me<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
physics and that works well for me and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
physics and that works well for me and
for<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> rod<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> recommend<00:00:24.840> anything<00:00:25.019> six<00:00:25.439> ten

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
for a rod I recommend anything six ten

straight<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.970> nose<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.940> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
straight out the nose just like that it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.660 
straight out the nose just like that it
may<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.050> seem<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.380> big<00:03:04.470> difference<00:03:04.980> but

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
may not seem like a big difference but

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.040 
may not seem like a big difference but
it's<00:03:05.820> not<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.210> cause<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.690> bait<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it's not going to cause this bait to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.810 
it's not going to cause this bait to
spin<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.440> much<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.130> not<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.580> twist

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
spin as much and it's not going to twist

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.410 
spin as much and it's not going to twist
your<00:03:08.910> line<00:03:09.120> up<00:03:09.270> near<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.870> bad<00:03:11.120> plus<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.270> feel

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
your line up near as bad plus I feel

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.570 
your line up near as bad plus I feel
like<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.110> better<00:03:13.230> hook<00:03:13.470> up<00:03:13.620> percentages

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
like I get better hook up percentages

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.040 
like I get better hook up percentages
with<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> style<00:03:15.630> hooking<00:03:16.140> method<00:03:16.560> as<00:03:16.650> well

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
with this style hooking method as well

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.200 
with this style hooking method as well
so<00:03:19.050> basically<00:03:19.410> there<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.400> that's

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
so basically there you have it that's

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.040 
so basically there you have it that's
your<00:03:21.360> drop<00:03:21.570> shot<00:03:21.780> rig<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:24.630> touch<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.990> few

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
middle of the body like so and you got

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.350 
middle of the body like so and you got
both<00:04:05.010> ends<00:04:05.190> working<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.150> seems

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
both ends working for you and it seems

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
like whenever there's a pressured bite

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.070 
like whenever there's a pressured bite
this<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.170> technique<00:04:10.620> tends<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.280> shine<00:04:12.080> so
