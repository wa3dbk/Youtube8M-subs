statement<00:01:50.619> about<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.979> car<00:01:51.399> comes<00:01:52.149> through<00:01:52.390> very

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
statement about a car comes through very

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.090 
statement about a car comes through very
simple<00:01:52.780> volumetric<00:01:53.259> statements<00:01:53.829> like<00:01:53.920> this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
simple volumetric statements like this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.030 
simple volumetric statements like this
right<00:01:54.790> then<00:01:55.360> if<00:01:55.479> it's<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.720> BMW<00:01:55.930> one<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:56.979> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
right then if it's a BMW one of the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.410 
right then if it's a BMW one of the
first<00:01:57.250> things<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.030> notice<00:01:58.180> is<00:02:00.119> how<00:02:01.119> far

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
first things you notice is how far

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.020 
first things you notice is how far
forward<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.990> wheel<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.640> relative<00:02:03.640> all<00:02:03.850> this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
forward the wheel is relative all this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.609 
forward the wheel is relative all this
because<00:02:04.299> we<00:02:04.420> have<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.570> very<00:02:04.750> short<00:02:04.780> short<00:02:05.409> front

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
because we have a very short short front

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.889 
because we have a very short short front
overhangs<00:02:06.040> because<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.180> whole<00:02:07.299> engine<00:02:07.689> sits

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
overhangs because the whole engine sits

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.080 
overhangs because the whole engine sits
back<00:02:08.049> is<00:02:08.259> longitudinally<00:02:08.950> gets<00:02:09.729> more<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
back is longitudinally gets more of the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.550 
back is longitudinally gets more of the
weight<00:02:10.239> on<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.450> rear<00:02:10.600> wheel<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.260> whole

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
weight on the rear wheel so that whole

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.840 
weight on the rear wheel so that whole
proportion<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.280> front<00:02:12.519> end<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.820> car

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
proportion of the front end of the car

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.610 
proportion of the front end of the car
is<00:02:13.120> very<00:02:13.180> important<00:02:13.720> including<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> wheel

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
is very important including the wheel

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.050 
is very important including the wheel
plus<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> nice<00:02:15.130> big<00:02:15.340> wheel<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.670> helps<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
plus a nice big wheel that helps to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.920

of a nice we're doing this in pieces I
hope<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.650> appreciate<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:25.560> how<00:02:26.560> the

hope you appreciate this is how the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.470 
hope you appreciate this is how the
aerodynamics<00:02:27.340> are<00:02:27.400> integrated<00:02:27.940> into<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.269> car

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
aerodynamics are integrated into the car

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.569 
aerodynamics are integrated into the car
do<00:02:29.380> they<00:02:29.500> give<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.739> sense<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.070> supporting<00:02:30.459> us

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
do they give this sense of supporting us

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.860 
do they give this sense of supporting us
does<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.850> car<00:02:31.030> seem<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.299> want<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> sit<00:02:31.660> down

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
does the car seem to want to sit down

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.319 
does the car seem to want to sit down
correctly<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:33.640> what<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:34.090> this

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
correctly this is really what all this

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.490 
correctly this is really what all this
line<00:02:34.540> work<00:02:34.720> back<00:02:34.900> here<00:02:35.079> is<00:02:35.140> trying<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.410> do

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
line work back here is trying to do

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.800 
line work back here is trying to do
conclude<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> car<00:02:36.220> correctly<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.359> give<00:02:37.720> it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
conclude the car correctly and give it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.310 
conclude the car correctly and give it
its<00:02:38.709> aerodynamic<00:02:39.340> stance<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.269> everything<00:02:41.260> in

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
its aerodynamic stance so everything in

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.750 
its aerodynamic stance so everything in
the<00:02:41.380> middle<00:02:41.500> then<00:02:41.920> should<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.549> kind<00:02:42.730> of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the middle then should just kind of

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.130 
the middle then should just kind of
connect<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.060> dots<00:02:43.269> right

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.800 

so<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.440> it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
so this is it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
so this is it
the<00:02:51.810> new<00:02:51.930> one<00:02:52.080> series<00:02:52.350> coupe<00:02:52.530> which<00:02:53.130> we're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the new one series coupe which we're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.200 
the new one series coupe which we're
very<00:02:53.490> very<00:02:53.580> proud<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.200> real<00:02:55.350> beauty

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
in a real classic sense and if you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.900 
in a real classic sense and if you
notice<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.830> type<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.040> two<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> half<00:03:08.610> box

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
notice the type of two and a half box

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.540 
notice the type of two and a half box
almost<00:03:09.420> three<00:03:09.660> box<00:03:09.870> styling<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.920> really<00:03:11.400> has

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
almost three box styling it really has

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.730 
almost three box styling it really has
that<00:03:11.580> 2k2<00:03:12.540> feel<00:03:12.990> about<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.590> that

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
that 2k2 feel about it you know that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740 
that 2k2 feel about it you know that
kind<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.010> sense<00:03:14.550> without<00:03:14.790> being<00:03:15.120> retro<00:03:15.540> or

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
kind of sense without being retro or

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.020 
kind of sense without being retro or
getting<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.290> whole<00:03:16.440> nostalgic<00:03:17.070> thing

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
getting into this whole nostalgic thing

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.610 
getting into this whole nostalgic thing
I<00:03:18.240> think<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.510> has<00:03:18.630> an<00:03:18.720> enormous<00:03:19.050> amount<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I think it has an enormous amount of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.780 
I think it has an enormous amount of the
sensitivity<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.880> 2k2<00:03:21.209> always<00:03:21.840> had<00:03:22.790> but

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
sensitivity that the 2k2 always had but

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.100 
sensitivity that the 2k2 always had but
then<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.270> course<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.630> one<00:03:24.810> series

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
then of course with one series

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.510 
then of course with one series
refinement<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.800> know<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.100> series<00:03:26.310> has

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
refinement you know the one series has

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.730 
refinement you know the one series has
got<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.820> big<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.300> friendly<00:03:27.600> face<00:03:27.870> but

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
got this big kind of friendly face but

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.140 
got this big kind of friendly face but
it<00:03:28.800> has<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.040> also<00:03:29.459> nice<00:03:29.640> high-water<00:03:30.060> line

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
it has this also nice high-water line

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.510 
it has this also nice high-water line
runs<00:03:30.810> around<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.110> car<00:03:31.290> really<00:03:31.950> nice<00:03:32.160> puts<00:03:32.430> it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
runs around the car really nice puts it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.340 
runs around the car really nice puts it
dynamic<00:03:32.940> through<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.180> sort<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.020> 2k2

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
dynamic through it sort of like the 2k2

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.820 
dynamic through it sort of like the 2k2
head<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.740> well<00:03:35.209> however<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.990> it<00:03:37.290> dives<00:03:37.620> down

makes<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.190> nice<00:03:38.370> conclusion<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.150> taillight

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
makes a nice conclusion on the taillight

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.390 
makes a nice conclusion on the taillight
and<00:03:39.660> lets<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> sport<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.770> line<00:03:40.890> come<00:03:41.100> across
