00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
metal but it's it's a bit lighter you

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.619 
metal but it's it's a bit lighter you
know<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:03.219> you<00:03:03.310> understand<00:03:03.639> it's<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.389> bit

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
know if you understand it's like a bit

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.360 
know if you understand it's like a bit
slower<00:03:05.079> instrumentally<00:03:05.769> just<00:03:06.069> you<00:03:06.129> know<00:03:06.219> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
slower instrumentally just you know it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.399 
slower instrumentally just you know it's
not<00:03:06.489> as<00:03:06.669> heavy<00:03:06.939> going<00:03:07.389> into<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.719> so<00:03:08.169> i<00:03:08.230> feel

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
not as heavy going into it so i feel

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.349 
not as heavy going into it so i feel
it's<00:03:08.769> definitely<00:03:09.189> like<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.609> reminds<00:03:10.239> me

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
it's definitely like it reminds me

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.270

slightly<00:03:10.599> of<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.049> way<00:03:11.200> i<00:03:11.680> don't<00:03:12.040> know

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
slightly of it that way i don't know

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.440 
slightly of it that way i don't know
it's<00:03:12.400> probably<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.790> me<00:03:12.939> but<00:03:13.150> yeah

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
it's probably just me but yeah

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.119 
it's probably just me but yeah
definitely<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.319> little<00:03:14.650> bit<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.859> role<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.069> this

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
definitely a little bit of role in this

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
guitar route which goes straight into a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.899 
guitar route which goes straight into a
really<00:03:25.419> heavy<00:03:25.719> fast<00:03:26.019> pace<00:03:26.290> first<00:03:27.010> verse<00:03:27.219> now

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
slow instrumentals and the heavy fast

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.949 
slow instrumentals and the heavy fast
paced<00:03:33.310> instrumentals<00:03:33.879> which<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.449> dig<00:03:34.659> in<00:03:34.780> bands

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959
