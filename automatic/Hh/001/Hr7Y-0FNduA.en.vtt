00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.050
 and yes we will start with our pride 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.270
 fierce when I actually wanted to 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.860
 but halfway I had none 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.790

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.349

 sale for f100 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.750
 the use of solicut then for 450 and then 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.970
 so cheap they scared than 1000 so me 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.470
 height 30 was a pension cheapest 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.150
 normal 600 or so by your work 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.770

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.180
 been upset I don't know if he even 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.790

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.829
 Noni just sells you half 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.750
 that of emphasis not really me entered 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.579
 stop around it but I already ate it 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.770
 three players but I'm not that good 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.020
 with steps with little money 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.420
 and yes that is wessel klote 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.520
 and then I call twenty kawaii money yes and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.829
 this that legally wants to state not so 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.570
 a lot because only in the 84th minute 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.400
 sjiep sjiep chiep there 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.170
 the one zero inside and I don't know if 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.270
 you will feel the next episode 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.740
 can remember if not just take a look 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.390
 the description is always a link 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.960
 to the previous episode and pretty whole 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.850
 playlist 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.920
 but the got three goals in the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.600
 90th minute and we went cheerfully 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 further with wÃ¤hrend a goal in the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.150
 90th minute 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.290
 and yes it was real yes it was real 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.490
 not necessary at all 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.260
 that was actually the worst of us 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.869
 viewing box of 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.210
 worse than yes so just pulls 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.460
 that there make that bowl but watch this me 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.990
 can 10 shot and 4 on goal he had one 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.390
 shot on goal and that was that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.640
 goal in the hall the last minute and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.369
 yes it could be the two points 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.010
 by you you know now drilled say 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.100
 yes i did get a point after that we 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.570
 anyway promoted party and saw here 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.820
 so why on the second bottle 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.259
 sold and the users as normal from 750 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.070
 watts set up that still a bit 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.070
 was cheap 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.900
 yes and where do you think were a set 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.899
 well here 16 half k cheapest bar 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.209
 then 16 and 750 or something was not like that 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.919
 well done because then came team of the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.540
 Soaked out what was actually a very good one 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.950
 team of the week is this week 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.610
 so then there was still further hassle 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.930
 around my I had thought so quickly 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.600
 had too 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 I think an architect or something I know 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.440
 I don't even know which team he yeasted 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.900
 it also can't be china actually yes me 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 think architect and yes i don't know that is 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.950
 actually really pretty strange things 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.290
 from the right back because as photos with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.630
 suddenly and dribbling but okay 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.280
 someone has my life so i have none 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.140
 want to change that map 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.670
 maybe just never do but now yes 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 he has the people and the team spirit 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.440
 style art I will also show you 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.760
 and we came across a little contract 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.160
 crisis I will get there eventually 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.530
 have a bronze contract to the hoffman 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
 and shit and then come against this 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.000
 yes completely argentinian team except on 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.380
 banovic and then there a bike is like 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.920
 most do know a very good one 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.830
 keeper and yes d look this man really ticks 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.600
 you very much fill here where I already ah yes 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.090
 I make it all the way away because here in the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.950
 fourth minute, that stupid milito is coming 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.420
 and admit i didn't know minutes that well 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.100
 but now makes all those in the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.680
 fourth minute photos 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.239
 I knew right away I love it 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.010
 I really don't do that anymore because we like that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.100
 ball went around so quickly and I know 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.930
 not what was going on 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.530
 and then it even becomes 2 0 through here 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.760
 green but the nice thing about a morning guest 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.860
 his internet eventually goes away 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.570
 so he gets that about you not me 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.730
 I will not defeat I will not get you 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.769
 played game I may just be tasty 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.390
 play the game again I thought 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.390
 I can see this principle later 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.910
 not about showing but booie 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.799
 look here sees the counts for nothing and 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.530
 then I buy a few contracts for 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.239
 250 watts also not as smart as want 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.320
 a few hours later the his or team arrived 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.780
 the week and then you can do them easily 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.570
 buy for 200 but yes does not matter 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.910
 50 coins per dog coins 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.950
 language that knife well that's a pity 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.420
 there really came to 10 episodes so 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.100
 behind that i could have a german right 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.959
 sit in the back of my club 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.400
 which of course is very easy if 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.260
 I have peace check at the swan 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.549
 now ok but as my right back or 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.729
 Left behind 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.070
 now yes now is zegmaar him out of 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.560
 conditioner as little condition so 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.710
 minute means I can pretty this one 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.410
 we take Mr. Guy 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.870
 So then I am happy and then I have 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.539
 luckily a bit behind the back of it 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.450
 but now also mention what they are in 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.220
 in the 90th minute there is already a zero and yes then 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.419
 sees it again on another lead 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.680
 but yes probably go anyway 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.450
 give away to see that we have the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.080
 lately every time and this time 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.820
 that happened 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.979
 yes actually again such a because here 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.690
 pato in the 45th minute 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.560
 this is really his first couple 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.780
 goal 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.090
 run through and what the fuck happens and how 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.150
 can put this ball in it 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.280
 yes ok first that you also post that down 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.169
 perhaps the fifa 13 notes are far away 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.539
 angle or power that you see here at lust 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.810
 it a shot on goal I agree 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.310
 and he or three shots of which two from 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.770
 about 45 meters 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.120
 yes that green punch why from him 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.240
 hold pointed throws from where i am 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.300
 about six now stand from that head circle 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.580
 and a shot from yes of 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.320
 yes goal say and yes I stayed like that 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.400
 but miss and miss opportunities 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.190
 and then finally flea disease 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 contest and you i could give him poultry 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.770
 And also looked around in Pays and 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.760
 menu 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.650
 and yes one and therefore I am 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.630
 no champion roles initially 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.700
 not yet i had 16 shots 10 on goal 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.430
 He had four shots and two to do it 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.400
 A couple's goal was roughly yes 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.860
 again of about forty meters 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.919
 so yes then you know he has one 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.539
 actually had a shock 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.580
 yes two more points needed in the last one 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.530
 matches how this time belong with this 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.180
 team so I have the German back right 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.190
 You already see has two power left and 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.780
 an orange link so it's nice 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.300
 even if you play on an exact one you would 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.720
 give dog 10 team read or nine and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.000
 authority and that happens by the way 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.430
 this competition these are internet for 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.320
 goes away full that you see so me man too 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.900
 nice then the game can play again 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.000
 and another chance at those two points later 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.010
 my yes you know about me going to play on 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.590
 a couple this match what the 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.080
 fuck ij I was crazy 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.820
 3000 want coins again 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.729
 yes that was previous division even though 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.289
 cooking away 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.089
 a champion to three times me 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.800
 indeed fell away or something 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:38.749
 and now this is the eext different 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.409
 internet which drops out and I become 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.259
 turned around 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:44.779
 ok but I essence behind him momentarily 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.939
 3200 times before the episode looks 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.800
 we continue with heavily new purchases 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.870
 don't forget to like 100 likes score 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.210
 times it was also very easy 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.650
 let's do it again this time I'll go 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.189
