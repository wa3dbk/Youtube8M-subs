 Uzbekistan Samarkand Ulugbek and now 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.849
 mine is given in honor of Uzbekistan already named 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
 seven minor planets last namesake 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.330
 famous republican observatory 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.400
 this was suggested by Japanese astronomers 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 find maidan using a telescope 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 tried and generals maidan ok now 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 There is not only in Uzbekistan and in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 solar system on clear nights small 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.199
 the planet is clearly visible in telescopes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.619
 an astronomical observatory in honor 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.359
 which she got her name 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.050
 Names the center of the minor planets when 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.489
 international astronomical union 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 call the planet Maidan offered 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 scientists from japan they are not her 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.010
 pioneers but such a right 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.660
 received as a reward for 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
 holding an international meeting 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 asteroids and comets meteors and grand 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.879
 project for the fence where we take the asteroid and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.680
 such a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 for us it was very unexpected and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 decision about uzbek japanese astronomers 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.980
 many years of communication together they lead 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.820
 surveillance of land hazards 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 asteroids 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.629
 for this on Maidan aki created 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.460
 special space service 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 security present time already 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 more than 500 thousand registered 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 asteroids 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.040
 it turns out 6500 of them are set aside in 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.500
 special category which is called 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.909
 to potentially dangerous asteroids but by this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 the activities of the observatory are not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.799
 limited to the main achievement output 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.360
 outside galactic space 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.420
 the big universe in the universe 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.869
 there are billions billions of galaxies 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.850
 so here is a certain part of these galaxies 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.579
 undergo a very active stormy 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.800
 process and these are so-called galaxies with 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.650
 active nuclei we 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720
 We are studying the physics of blazars 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.900
 Maidan KSK Observatory located on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.270
 a height of 2700 meters in the spurs of the Pamir-Alay 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.280
 this is an ideal place for observation 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.440
 plenty of clear nights and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.200
 unique equipment allows 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.550
 get a lot of quality shots 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.150
 the main telescope is equipped with a digital 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.160
 camera 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.290
 which is capable of working at 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.750
 minus one hundred and ten degrees 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.100
 there is no such equipment 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 single cis observatory 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.330
 it allows you to even consider 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.610
 cosmonauts ms coming out into the open 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.190

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 to the international project guy scientists 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 will carry out high-precision measurements 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.670
 coordinates about a billion stars and on 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.700
