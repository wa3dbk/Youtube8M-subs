down under the car and I find the oil
pan<00:00:54.469> which<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.020> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
pan which is that right there and the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
pan which is that right there and the
boat<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.710> right<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.879> fifteen

millimeter<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> 15<00:01:02.190> millimeter

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
millimeter so I put a 15 millimeter

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
millimeter so I put a 15 millimeter
ratchet<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:04.500> turn<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.830> bottom<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
ratchet on it and I turn the bottom of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.710 
ratchet on it and I turn the bottom of
the<00:01:05.519> ratchet<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> bolt<00:01:06.540> loose

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the ratchet to take the bolt loose

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.490 
the ratchet to take the bolt loose
toward<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> passenger<00:01:07.770> side<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:09.320> once<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
toward the passenger side so once you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
toward the passenger side so once you
screw<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> bolt<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> drain

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
screw the bolt out you want to drain

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.240 
screw the bolt out you want to drain
this<00:01:13.430> into<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.900> drain<00:01:15.900> pan<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.830> recycle

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
this into a drain pan so you can recycle

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.230 
this into a drain pan so you can recycle
it<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:18.270> auto<00:01:18.420> parts<00:01:18.780> store<00:01:19.939> okay<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.090> got

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it at an auto parts store okay we got

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.320 
it at an auto parts store okay we got
the<00:01:21.360> oil<00:01:21.570> draining<00:01:22.259> into<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.890> drain<00:01:23.189> pan<00:01:23.520> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the oil draining into the drain pan it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
the oil draining into the drain pan it's
coming<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.810> kind<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> thick<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
coming out kind of thick and this is the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
coming out kind of thick and this is the
car<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.670> been<00:01:26.939> sitting<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.540> while<00:01:27.650> so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
car that's been sitting for a while so

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
car that's been sitting for a while so
we'll<00:01:28.860> probably<00:01:29.390> flush<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> motor<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
we'll probably flush the motor with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
we'll probably flush the motor with
something<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> oil<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.340> looking<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
something but the oil is looking kind of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
something but the oil is looking kind of
light<00:01:34.470> brown<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:35.130> coffee<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.150> may<00:01:36.270> be

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
light brown like coffee so there may be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
light brown like coffee so there may be
a<00:01:36.479> problem<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> motor<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> head

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a problem with the motor like a head

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.539 
a problem with the motor like a head
gasket<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> crack<00:01:39.329> block<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> oil

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
gasket or a crack block or so the oil

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
gasket or a crack block or so the oil
should<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.909> black<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.750> brown<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.380> next

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
should be black not brown like this next

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.969 
should be black not brown like this next
you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> reposition<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:46.729> oil<00:01:47.729> pan<00:01:48.149> to

oil<00:02:08.360> pan<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.470> remove<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.160> filter<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.819> can

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
oil pan and remove the filter so you can

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.850 
oil pan and remove the filter so you can
install<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.300> new<00:02:11.510> one<00:02:11.540> now<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> old<00:02:12.590> bolt

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
install a new one now the old bolt

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.490 
install a new one now the old bolt
actually<00:02:13.099> has<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.970> built<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.480> gasket<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.290> it's

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
actually has a built in gasket so it's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.180 
actually has a built in gasket so it's
best<00:02:15.770> if<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.459> new<00:02:16.700> bolt<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.750> gasket<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
best if you get a new bolt and gasket to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.360 
best if you get a new bolt and gasket to
put<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.640> back<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.569> plug<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.110> oil<00:02:21.349> pan<00:02:22.010> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
put this back and plug the oil pan and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.509 
put this back and plug the oil pan and
that<00:02:23.330> way<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.709> good<00:02:24.980> seal<00:02:25.220> when<00:02:25.400> you

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
that way you have a good seal when you

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.390 
that way you have a good seal when you
won't<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.849> dripping<00:02:26.180> oil<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.810> your<00:02:27.050> driveway

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
won't be dripping oil in your driveway

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.040 
won't be dripping oil in your driveway
okay<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.640> put<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.239> oil<00:02:30.220> pan<00:02:31.220> bone<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.849> now<00:02:32.750> since

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
okay I put the oil pan bone in now since

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.170 
okay I put the oil pan bone in now since
it<00:02:33.230> has<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> rubber<00:02:33.709> gasket<00:02:34.010> I'm<00:02:34.519> only<00:02:34.819> going<00:02:35.090> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
it has a rubber gasket I'm only going to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.470 
it has a rubber gasket I'm only going to
torque<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.900> about<00:02:36.260> 12<00:02:37.180> foot<00:02:38.180> pounds<00:02:40.480> all

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
torque that to about 12 foot pounds all

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.330 
torque that to about 12 foot pounds all
right<00:02:41.660> so<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.930> take<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> oil<00:02:42.380> filter<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
right so you take the oil filter and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.460 
right so you take the oil filter and
what<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.700> want<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.299> prime<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.049> filter

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
what you want to do is prime the filter

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.470 
what you want to do is prime the filter
a<00:02:45.500> little<00:02:45.680> bit<00:02:45.980> since<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> goes<00:02:46.610> on<00:02:46.850> sideways

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
a little bit since it goes on sideways

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.330 
a little bit since it goes on sideways
on<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.690> motors<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.200> can't<00:02:48.440> put<00:02:48.650> too<00:02:48.890> much<00:02:49.040> in

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
on the motors you can't put too much in

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.729 
on the motors you can't put too much in
it<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:50.060> it'll<00:02:50.299> just<00:02:50.330> pour<00:02:50.780> out<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.650> you

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
it because it'll just pour out so you

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.850 
it because it'll just pour out so you
fill<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:52.250> up<00:02:52.459> one<00:02:52.730> time<00:02:53.000> with<00:02:53.209> oil<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.860> then

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
fill this up one time with oil and then

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.059 
fill this up one time with oil and then
you<00:02:55.100> screw<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.060> front<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> motor

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
you screw it on the front of the motor

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.420 
you screw it on the front of the motor
also<00:02:58.069> before<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> put<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> oil<00:02:59.390> filter<00:03:00.319> on

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
also before you put the oil filter on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.420 
also before you put the oil filter on
you<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.750> lubricate<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.470> rubber<00:03:04.040> seal

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
you want to lubricate the rubber seal

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.500 
you want to lubricate the rubber seal
around<00:03:04.700> there<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:06.500> oil<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.209> block

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
around there with oil and on the block

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.390 
around there with oil and on the block
you<00:03:08.900> want<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.170> make<00:03:09.380> sure<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.920> there<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.250> no

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
you want to make sure that there is no

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.090 
you want to make sure that there is no
rubber<00:03:10.670> gasket<00:03:11.299> on<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> motor<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.440> want

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
to wipe the surface of the motor clean

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.620 
to wipe the surface of the motor clean
where<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.010> seal<00:03:16.310> will<00:03:16.549> chill<00:03:16.880> against<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.450> and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
where the seal will chill against it and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.470 
where the seal will chill against it and
make<00:03:17.810> contact<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.519> lubricated

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
make contact so you have a lubricated

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.759 
make contact so you have a lubricated
seal<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.280> clean<00:03:23.410> receptacle<00:03:24.410> now

seal and you have a clean receptacle now

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.090 
seal and you have a clean receptacle now
with<00:03:25.400> these<00:03:25.670> type<00:03:26.209> of<00:03:26.239> oil<00:03:26.600> filters<00:03:27.170> what<00:03:27.920> you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
with these type of oil filters what you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.979 
with these type of oil filters what you
do<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.850> shows<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.120> picture<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.720> there

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
do is and it shows a picture on there

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.620 
do is and it shows a picture on there
you<00:03:30.650> put<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.190> until<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.970> seal<00:03:32.269> makes

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
you put it on until the seal makes

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.250 
you put it on until the seal makes
contact<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> motor<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.609> you<00:03:34.790> turn<00:03:35.090> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
contact to the motor then you turn it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.590 
contact to the motor then you turn it
3/4<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.709> turn<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.790> that's<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.150> tight<00:03:38.420> you

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
3/4 of a turn so that's how tight you

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.720 
3/4 of a turn so that's how tight you
got<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.930> make<00:03:39.109> it<00:03:39.140> so<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.890> might<00:03:40.190> want<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.459> put

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
got to make it so you might want to put

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.809 
got to make it so you might want to put
a<00:03:40.910> mark<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:41.870> two<00:03:42.079> on<00:03:42.319> here<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.430> once<00:03:43.640> it

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
a mark or two on here so that once it

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.270 
a mark or two on here so that once it
touches<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.660> motor<00:03:44.959> surface<00:03:45.530> you'll<00:03:46.040> know

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
touches the motor surface you'll know

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.190 
touches the motor surface you'll know
how<00:03:46.519> far<00:03:46.850> over<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.420> 2/3<00:03:48.790> 3/4<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:50.060> turn<00:03:50.269> once

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
how far over is 2/3 3/4 of a turn once

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.890 
how far over is 2/3 3/4 of a turn once
you<00:03:51.319> get<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> oil<00:03:51.769> filter<00:03:52.100> on<00:03:52.310> there<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:53.389> open

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
you get the oil filter on there you open

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.190 
you get the oil filter on there you open
up<00:03:54.019> your<00:03:54.260> oil<00:03:55.130> cap<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:56.450> fill<00:03:56.720> in<00:03:56.930> however

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
up your oil cap and you fill in however

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.960 
up your oil cap and you fill in however
many<00:03:57.380> quarts<00:03:57.889> are<00:03:57.980> supposed<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.430> go<00:03:58.639> in<00:03:58.790> there

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
many quarts are supposed to go in there

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.960 
many quarts are supposed to go in there
I<00:03:59.120> believe<00:03:59.359> this<00:03:59.630> is<00:03:59.690> 4<00:04:00.019> quarts<00:04:00.380> of<00:04:00.859> 5w30

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
I believe this is 4 quarts of 5w30

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.050 
I believe this is 4 quarts of 5w30
and<00:04:02.239> then<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.200> start<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.650> car<00:04:03.889> let<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:04.910> idle

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
and then you start the car let it idle

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.379 
and then you start the car let it idle
for<00:04:05.269> five<00:04:05.690> minutes<00:04:06.109> shut<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.920> car<00:04:07.130> off<00:04:07.389> put

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
for five minutes shut the car off put
