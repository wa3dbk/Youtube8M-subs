00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
go to trade and then you could be like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.120 
go to trade and then you could be like
oh<00:03:19.550> that's<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.940> crumb<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:20.420> scorched<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.440> then

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
oh that's a crumb but scorched and then

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.360 
oh that's a crumb but scorched and then
field-tested<00:03:22.970> which<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.800> in<00:03:24.800> order<00:03:25.190> it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
field-tested which is the in order it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.720 
field-tested which is the in order it
goes<00:03:25.580> from<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:27.200> name<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.560> knife<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.550> then

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
goes from the name of the knife and then

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.000 
goes from the name of the knife and then
the<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:29.959> not<00:03:30.110> like<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.470> effect<00:03:30.890> but

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
the like it's not like the effect but

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.120 
the like it's not like the effect but
it's<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.580> type<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.880> paint<00:03:32.360> or<00:03:32.540> whatever<00:03:32.810> and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
it's the type of paint or whatever and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's the type of paint or whatever and
then<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.430> will<00:03:34.550> say<00:03:34.900> field-tested

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
then it will say field-tested

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.380 
then it will say field-tested
battle-scarred<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.830> all<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.160> etc<00:03:37.820> so

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
battle-scarred and all that etc so

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.780 
battle-scarred and all that etc so
obviously<00:03:39.430> field-tested<00:03:40.430> isn't<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
obviously field-tested isn't the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.520 
obviously field-tested isn't the
greatest<00:03:40.880> battle<00:03:41.600> scarred<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.050> obviously<00:03:42.440> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
greatest battle scarred is obviously the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.680 
greatest battle scarred is obviously the
worst<00:03:42.860> but<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:43.459> some<00:03:43.760> cases<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.269> could<00:03:44.360> be<00:03:44.480> more

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
worst but in some cases it could be more

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.190 
worst but in some cases it could be more
rare<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.530> be<00:03:45.650> worth<00:03:45.830> more<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:48.019> yeah

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
rare so it would be worth more so yeah

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.740 
rare so it would be worth more so yeah
and<00:03:48.440> then<00:03:48.830> factory<00:03:49.760> new<00:03:49.970> would<00:03:50.150> obviously<00:03:50.420> be

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
and then factory new would obviously be

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.050 
and then factory new would obviously be
worth<00:03:51.290> usually<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.100> most<00:03:52.250> because<00:03:52.549> it's<00:03:52.850> like

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
worth usually the most because it's like

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.629 
worth usually the most because it's like
the<00:03:53.239> highest<00:03:53.540> quality<00:03:53.720> so<00:03:54.200> field<00:03:54.440> as<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:55.430> can

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
the highest quality so field as you can

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.220 
the highest quality so field as you can
see<00:03:55.760> right<00:03:55.790> here<00:03:56.000> field-tested<00:03:56.690> do

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
see right here field-tested do

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.119 
see right here field-tested do
tested<00:03:57.940> field-tested<00:03:59.050> well-worn<00:04:00.050> so<00:04:00.440> that's

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
tested field-tested well-worn so that's

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.160 
tested field-tested well-worn so that's
a<00:04:01.430> bit<00:04:01.610> lower<00:04:01.819> than<00:04:02.269> iming<00:04:02.659> a<00:04:02.810> bit<00:04:02.959> higher<00:04:03.140> than

a bit lower than iming a bit higher than
field<00:04:03.650> testing<00:04:04.040> because<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.580> not<00:04:04.790> as<00:04:05.000> bad

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
field testing because it's not as bad

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.789 
field testing because it's not as bad
kind<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.280> clean<00:04:07.700> but<00:04:08.060> little<00:04:08.510> gashes<00:04:09.049> are<00:04:09.620> not

gashes but like little cuts minimal wear
which<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.349> lot<00:04:12.739> better<00:04:12.920> than<00:04:13.250> well-worn<00:04:13.970> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
which is a lot better than well-worn and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.930 
which is a lot better than well-worn and
then<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.140> think<00:04:15.410> I've<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> factory-new<00:04:16.459> here

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
then I think I've a factory-new here

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.030 
then I think I've a factory-new here
somewhere<00:04:17.479> I'm<00:04:18.019> not<00:04:18.260> sure<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.500> don't<00:04:18.620> have<00:04:18.829> much

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
somewhere I'm not sure I don't have much

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.500 
somewhere I'm not sure I don't have much
stuff<00:04:19.280> yeah<00:04:19.489> factoring<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.180> right<00:04:20.359> here

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
stuff yeah factoring you right here

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.680 
stuff yeah factoring you right here
obviously<00:04:21.220> cuffs<00:04:22.220> cuffs<00:04:22.699> or<00:04:23.000> anything<00:04:23.419> she

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
obviously cuffs cuffs or anything she

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.490 
obviously cuffs cuffs or anything she
looks<00:04:23.870> nice<00:04:24.110> neat<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:25.130> yeah<00:04:25.729> so<00:04:26.630> most<00:04:27.260> weapons

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
looks nice neat so yeah so most weapons

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.779 
looks nice neat so yeah so most weapons
I<00:04:27.979> mean<00:04:28.310> all<00:04:28.760> weapons<00:04:29.449> have<00:04:29.660> their<00:04:29.840> own<00:04:29.870> little

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
I mean all weapons have their own little

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.740 
I mean all weapons have their own little
quality<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.289> I<00:04:33.440> were<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.680> do<00:04:33.800> Karama<00:04:34.750> prom

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
quality so if I were to do Karama prom

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.510 
quality so if I were to do Karama prom
bit<00:04:36.080> scorched<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:38.320> obviously<00:04:39.320> knives<00:04:40.100> in<00:04:40.400> this

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
bit scorched so obviously knives in this

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.340 
bit scorched so obviously knives in this
game<00:04:40.729> are<00:04:40.760> unusual<00:04:41.240> size<00:04:41.539> a<00:04:41.870> minimal<00:04:42.260> wear

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
game are unusual size a minimal wear

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.520 
game are unusual size a minimal wear
field-tested<00:04:42.949> well<00:04:43.100> worn<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.930> I<00:04:45.289> have

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
field-tested well worn and then I have

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.469 
field-tested well worn and then I have
field<00:04:45.830> tested<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:46.520> let's<00:04:46.729> say<00:04:46.850> determine<00:04:47.389> the

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
field tested so let's say determine the

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.340 
field tested so let's say determine the
price<00:04:47.800> 214<00:04:48.800> dollars<00:04:49.160> arm<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.900> shouldn't

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
price 214 dollars arm you shouldn't

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.650 
price 214 dollars arm you shouldn't
trust<00:04:51.740> offers<00:04:52.190> when<00:04:52.639> there's<00:04:52.820> maybe<00:04:53.000> like<00:04:53.240> one

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
trust offers when there's maybe like one

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.860 
trust offers when there's maybe like one
of<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.960> knives<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:54.590> I'll<00:04:54.919> try<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> new<00:04:55.280> crew<00:04:55.580> one

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
of the knives so I'll try a new crew one

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.950 
of the knives so I'll try a new crew one
so<00:04:56.870> let's<00:04:57.500> say<00:04:57.830> there<00:04:58.130> is<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> knife<00:04:58.639> and<00:04:58.960> it's

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
so let's say there is a knife and it's

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.379 
so let's say there is a knife and it's
one<00:05:00.169> of<00:05:00.289> one<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.220> quantity<00:05:01.700> there's<00:05:01.940> only<00:05:02.120> one

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
one of one so quantity there's only one

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.730 
one of one so quantity there's only one
on<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.539> market<00:05:02.840> like<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.470> shouldn't

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
on the market like this you shouldn't

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.520 
on the market like this you shouldn't
really<00:05:03.950> trust<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.340> price<00:05:04.550> because<00:05:04.820> honestly

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
really trust the price because honestly

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.560 
really trust the price because honestly
380<00:05:06.530> bucks<00:05:06.919> for<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.550> scorched<00:05:08.419> bayonet<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.460> very

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
380 bucks for a scorched bayonet is very

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.200 
380 bucks for a scorched bayonet is very
very<00:05:11.570> incredibly<00:05:12.169> high<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.610> yeah<00:05:13.849> as<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.120> can

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
very incredibly high so yeah as you can

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.270 
very incredibly high so yeah as you can
see<00:05:14.389> here<00:05:14.630> people<00:05:14.810> are<00:05:14.990> previously<00:05:15.800> selling

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
see here people are previously selling

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.909 
see here people are previously selling
for<00:05:16.460> 150<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.450> yeah<00:05:17.930> you'd<00:05:18.229> probably<00:05:18.260> not

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
for 150 so yeah you'd probably not

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.659 
for 150 so yeah you'd probably not
really<00:05:19.220> get<00:05:19.840> 380<00:05:20.840> out<00:05:21.229> of<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.530> scorched<00:05:21.979> scorch

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
really get 380 out of a scorched scorch

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.140 
really get 380 out of a scorched scorch
doesn't<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.120> best<00:05:23.300> um<00:05:24.310> either<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.820> could<00:05:25.970> get

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
doesn't the best um either you could get

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.390 
doesn't the best um either you could get
like<00:05:26.300> slaughter<00:05:26.599> which<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.020> pretty<00:05:27.800> damn<00:05:28.070> good

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
like slaughter which is pretty damn good

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.779 
like slaughter which is pretty damn good
and<00:05:28.729> then<00:05:29.389> like<00:05:29.720> case<00:05:30.590> hardened<00:05:31.070> things<00:05:31.610> like

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
and then like case hardened things like

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.550 
and then like case hardened things like
that<00:05:31.910> or<00:05:32.120> fade<00:05:32.419> I'm<00:05:32.630> pretty<00:05:32.900> sure<00:05:33.020> fate<00:05:33.289> is<00:05:33.410> the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
that or fade I'm pretty sure fate is the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.620 
that or fade I'm pretty sure fate is the
best<00:05:33.830> I'm<00:05:34.400> not<00:05:34.520> sure<00:05:34.669> if<00:05:34.760> it's<00:05:34.820> fade<00:05:35.360> or

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
best I'm not sure if it's fade or

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.200 
best I'm not sure if it's fade or
slaughter<00:05:36.020> or<00:05:36.349> crimson<00:05:36.740> web<00:05:37.160> but<00:05:37.490> one<00:05:38.120> of

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
slaughter or crimson web but one of

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.000 
slaughter or crimson web but one of
those<00:05:38.330> are<00:05:38.539> all<00:05:38.630> God<00:05:38.870> dear<00:05:39.200> so<00:05:39.530> they're<00:05:39.800> pretty

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
those are all God dear so they're pretty

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.969 
those are all God dear so they're pretty
uncommon<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:41.150> nice<00:05:42.020> looking<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:42.620> like<00:05:42.770> case

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
uncommon and nice looking I like case

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.770 
uncommon and nice looking I like case
hardened<00:05:43.280> though<00:05:43.430> but<00:05:43.880> i<00:05:43.910> guess<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.630> case

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
hardened though but i guess the case

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.330 
hardened though but i guess the case
hardened<00:05:45.110> isn't<00:05:45.440> worth<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.620> most<00:05:45.830> it's

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
hardened isn't worth the most it's

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.480 
hardened isn't worth the most it's
pretty<00:05:46.520> common<00:05:47.260> crimson<00:05:48.260> web<00:05:48.440> isn't<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:49.340> best

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
pretty common crimson web isn't the best

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.969 
pretty common crimson web isn't the best
either<00:05:49.729> but<00:05:50.090> this<00:05:50.389> one<00:05:50.599> is<00:05:50.900> battle-scarred<00:05:51.680> as

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
either but this one is battle-scarred as

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.010 
either but this one is battle-scarred as
you<00:05:52.070> can<00:05:52.190> see<00:05:52.340> so<00:05:52.639> obviously<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.720> whole<00:05:53.840> knife

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
you can see so obviously the whole knife

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.839 
you can see so obviously the whole knife
wouldn't<00:05:54.410> be<00:05:54.530> red<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:54.800> neat<00:05:55.280> looking<00:05:55.639> it's

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
wouldn't be red and neat looking it's

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.439 
wouldn't be red and neat looking it's
all<00:05:56.030> cut<00:05:56.300> up<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.599> paint<00:05:57.590> removed<00:05:58.010> so<00:05:58.460> that's

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
all cut up and paint removed so that's

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.960 
all cut up and paint removed so that's
basically<00:05:59.690> how<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.169> traded<00:06:00.800> see<00:06:00.949> a<00:06:00.979> scope<00:06:01.310> you

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
basically how you traded see a scope you

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.730 
basically how you traded see a scope you
could<00:06:02.090> also<00:06:02.210> use<00:06:02.330> tf2<00:06:02.810> outpost<00:06:03.199> because<00:06:03.590> they

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
could also use tf2 outpost because they

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.610 
could also use tf2 outpost because they
have<00:06:03.919> their<00:06:04.099> own<00:06:04.130> section<00:06:04.669> where<00:06:05.120> you<00:06:05.300> can

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
have their own section where you can

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.380 
have their own section where you can
trade<00:06:06.620> cska<00:06:07.280> items<00:06:07.580> which<00:06:07.789> I<00:06:08.000> am<00:06:08.150> currently

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
trade cska items which I am currently

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.110 
trade cska items which I am currently
doing<00:06:08.690> as<00:06:08.930> well

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
doing as well

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.379 
doing as well
so<00:06:10.240> you<00:06:10.330> can<00:06:10.479> see<00:06:10.660> my<00:06:10.810> crumpet<00:06:11.380> scorched<00:06:11.889> here

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
so you can see my crumpet scorched here
