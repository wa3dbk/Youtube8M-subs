00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.919
 I can not get out of my diet although I 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.270
 say they are bad but it turns out that 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.000
 many of them could be good 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.860
 doctor goleo sorprÃ©ndanos good that 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 who have the doctors first that 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.400
 it's bad that bad is good during what 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.679
 Well, it's bad, now we bring these 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.119
 elements that new research has 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.100
 reported that indeed if they are 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.170
 good for health are not so bad 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.109
 as we thought we would start with the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.760
 whalers of the horns of the exact 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.349
 we'll talk about cracklings against 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.090
 little legs and the question would be which one has 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.970
 more than until it turns out that the legs 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.440
 they contain more fat than pork rind and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.630
 on the other the pork rind contains a 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.730
 fat that is identical to olive oil 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 and then he has another fat that is the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.230
 lauric acid that does not raise cholesterol 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.059
 so you can eat cracklings 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.760
 because they will not raise cholesterol and 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.829
 plus an ounce of pork crack contains 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.149
 the same protein as three ounces of 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.520
 chicken breast 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.840
 they just kicked out of state I did not 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.329
 consume of flour because they are the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 names is nothing else wine wine 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.379
 or good this here at harvard 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.870
 researchers in laughter started to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.790
 realize what happened with being taking 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.260
 came not and it turns out that those people 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.870
 who drink up to two glasses 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.540
 and not a thousand times longer than those who do not take 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.880
 came a lot now very important in 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 contraposition in england reviewed 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480
 what happened with two glasses of wine and this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.260
 reduces the number of neurons in the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.030
 brain 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.460
 so advice for all our 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.500
 public a glass of wine a day is good 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.630
 for health and without spine the best the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 tino no ar I hope I told you right 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.320
 he assumes that he has the most 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.030
 antioxidants doctor to me that I like 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 crush it with egg the meat is loaded 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 the weapon of a is dry it turns out that the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.630
 Dry meat if we like that 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.940
 say that you do not have extra things that you do not 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.180
 they contain nitrites then this is 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.870
 good for health and if it's organic 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.970
 spectacular and talking about things 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.190
 organic the cream encourages to talk the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.850
 sour cream is spectacular has the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 half the calories of mayonnaise as well 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.650
 has very few saturated fats less 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.600
 that a 12 ounce milk and it's also 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.250
 good pagassano jaaber doctor I'm 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200
 seeing the artisans say you are going to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.150
 generate the salt because we do not have it here is 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 the best for the last one turns out to be 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.080
 bad reduce 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 and the salt you have to eat quantities 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.650
 moderate to be here we are seeing 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.930
 on screen what would be a quantity 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.700
 normal that are 2 to 3 grams and towards 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.800
 back we would be seeing 6 stretches that 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.680
 yes it is a lot you have to reduce it but not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.230
 eliminate it you have to use salt on the table and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 as always well
