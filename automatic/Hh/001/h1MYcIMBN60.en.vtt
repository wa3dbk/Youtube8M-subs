00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 today 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.430
 venezuela falls in front of china and stays 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.190
 with the silver medal in the final of the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.270
 Women's football at the Olympic Games 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.369
 of youth 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.710
 nanjing 2014 the encounter with the nation 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.470
 hostess began under the control of the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.050
 ball the relentless attack by part of 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.989
 the Chinese taking advantage of their condition of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.850
 Venezuelan locals did not know 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.700
 decipher the offensive system of the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 contrary and 10 minute approached the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.450
 first goal for China the both premature 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.520
 the criollas would despair and thanks to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.680
 Absolute handling of the spherical part 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.290
 of Asians and the impotence of 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.380
 Venezuela would arrive the second and third 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.710
 with the 3 for 0 marker they would go to the 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.530
 rest in the second half was expected 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.630
 the reaction of venezuela notwithstanding a 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.930
 play of several touches gave him the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.820
 fourth goal to the Chinese fifth for 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.250
 the hostesses arrived on the whistle 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.010
 end of the game product of a 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.920
 regrettable concentration error 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.470
 of the gold creole goalkeeper for china 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.990
 silver for venezuela and bronze for 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.000
 mexico in the women's football final 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.680
 of the second edition of the games 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.210
 Youth Olympics Nanjing 2014 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760
 China has more experience than us 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.110
 has more years preparing but good to 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.790
 go ahead 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.080
 the feeling is somewhat sad despite 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.550
 that we do not wear a silver medal 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.800
 but good to keep going 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.720
 working to think about the next 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.570
 South American who is today won 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.250
 experience the female team and how 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.160
 I will manifest itself in the federation as 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.780
 that really worries him what 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.550
 disturbs the operation that result 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 Let's look at what I just told you 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.670
 the journalist this time let's look 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.140
 where are we first regionally 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.240
 Who we play against and what we do 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.430
 us our structure or how we 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.640
 we prepare before coming to be able to do 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.410
 to be able to compete with the countries of asia 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.060
 the steps in costa rica is already a 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.060
 answer is what we need we are 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.190
 clear and 20 is an evaluation a x ray 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.540
 an exam as it says evaluation that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 Venezuela needs to aspire to 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
 great things or continue in the in the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.560
 national context or play only with 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.510
 neighbors or play with what equipment so that 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 we can aspire to be able to 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.790
 one-on-one match with china I allow myself 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.540
 ask a question about that reality 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.250
 when it is put on the balance 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.030
 indistinctly in the context not 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.150
 we are playing like this 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 with coffee coffee in suramÃ©rica work 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.590
 previous preparation when placed 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.330
 in the balance talking to Chinese colleague 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.550
 these girls have never stopped playing 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.370
 never helpless they have modules 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.870
 permanent an established nutrition 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.760
 previously I think there are people 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.560
 we have to check if you have 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.780
 obviously said the structure and it's 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.090
 the organization and it's many things 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.010
 look is a thing that from night to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.819
 tomorrow we do not get it we're talking 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.370
 10 years 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.000
 Towards today it takes almost 20 years 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.580
 in all of that I arrive in China and only 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.100
 to see the structure of the fields the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.510
 facilities that coaches have 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.250
 knowledge information in what 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.290
 that fifa tell me things are from 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.390
 first good hand let's start asking in 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.040
 venezuela to guide us and we 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.650
 approach to arrive within 20 years not 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.750
 I will obviously be but today it was 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.340
 something that could not be faced 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.100
 team of unanimous and of preparation with 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.420
 50 50 international matches I think 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.910
 that the question came out cheap but 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.140
 as legal to many we make that effort 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.940
 until the last because it is dignity 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.710
 of the country is the dignity of the activity 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.390
 and I really appreciate everything 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.490
 grateful fan with the federation 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580
 with the ine of that good brought us a 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.170
 enough time to get there 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.180
 to the second place that was what gave us 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.650
 we can not say more we have to be 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.660
 responsible with our acts and our 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.830
 done before going out to a competition and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.160
 how far have our 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.160
 limiting
