00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello to all i would like today 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.290
 suggest a small recipe at the can for a breakfast to the point of 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.980
 ideal fall these are actually scleroseplastic papers are described can 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.550
 do not end up in the United States, which is abundantly watered with maple syrup 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.230
 general 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.320
 to make this recipe tokens against intrusions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 so it's very simple in place to have the type specify a text 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 fortunately 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.880
 250 grams of flour 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.659
 moreover the g20 announces the complete end for example 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.700
 135 minutes east 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 10 grams of melted butter on the school 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.800
 ten tons of carbon dioxide 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.230
 it will take only for hamed and that and if you have some bicarbonate 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.780
 to the program also not 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 for sugar men and as it should be nicknamed ideally it's better 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.469
 so if you were there 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.850
 so I understand his recipe by mixing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.600
 in the country 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.300
 so we'll beat him 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 a little trick there stone parrat 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.940
 then for companies under 50 it's my family 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.340
 with the cells of an ap donor 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 sugar 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.940
 he had finished any relationship is able to beat now anyway 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.850
 and so 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 for the rest of the season 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.480
 then we will add in 89 countries 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 gradually of course 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 in the center pompidou 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.120
 so we're going to get a dough 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.120
 like a potato a little thick 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 it is better for other readers 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.239
 they also bought the couple's two children in prevention 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.629
 ap 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.999
 we can not be an accomplice 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.229
 is ready for a little rest 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.740
 so we'll let her down 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.519

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.150
 he can then we will meet for the spoon with our prices 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.349

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.409
 twenty minutes 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.409
 first, I do not convince the contrary 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.650
 you can also go even higher for now only emirate by 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.529
 example 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.489

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.349
 I love gossip colorist dough 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.439
 I use it's so easy I'm proud 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.129

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.549
 gravelines 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.029
 and like any title here this time 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.819
 and in attack not a question that maybe 2 minutes on each side one 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.819
 going to see what it was I loved 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.399
