so<00:01:44.920> um<00:01:45.900> enough<00:01:46.900> noise<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.320> there<00:01:48.240> let's<00:01:49.240> take

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
so um enough noise in there let's take

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:59.100 
so um enough noise in there let's take
it<00:01:49.660> for<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.170> spin<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:55.570> runs<00:01:56.550> very<00:01:57.550> well<00:01:58.110> cause

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
it for a spin still runs very well cause

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.030 
it for a spin still runs very well cause
it<00:01:59.260> had<00:01:59.470> its<00:01:59.770> share<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.520> maintenance<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
it had its share of maintenance over the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.950 
it had its share of maintenance over the
last<00:02:03.220> year<00:02:05.850> changed<00:02:06.850> fuel<00:02:07.180> pump<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:10.240> main

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
last year changed fuel pump the main

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.080 
last year changed fuel pump the main
fuel<00:02:11.200> pump<00:02:11.530> has<00:02:11.860> been<00:02:12.160> used<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
fuel pump has been used and right now it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.430 
fuel pump has been used and right now it
runs<00:02:16.330> run<00:02:17.080> smoothly<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.720> course<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.320> don't

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
runs run smoothly of course I don't

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.870 
runs run smoothly of course I don't
drive<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.400> much<00:02:21.760> as<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.180> used<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
drive it as much as I used to but it's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.350 
drive it as much as I used to but it's
still<00:02:25.270> doing<00:02:25.780> quite<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.050> ride<00:02:26.230> oh<00:02:26.500> yeah<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
still doing quite a ride oh yeah the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.330 
still doing quite a ride oh yeah the
most<00:02:28.360> recent<00:02:29.430> improvement<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:32.070> free<00:02:33.070> flow

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
most recent improvement is a free flow

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.400 
most recent improvement is a free flow
exhaust<00:02:33.370> from<00:02:34.300> ipd<00:02:34.780> thanks<00:02:35.590> guys<00:02:36.750> which<00:02:37.750> added

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
exhaust from ipd thanks guys which added

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.140 
exhaust from ipd thanks guys which added
i<00:02:39.720> think<00:02:40.720> approximately<00:02:40.980> 10<00:02:41.980> 12<00:02:42.670> horsepower

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
i think approximately 10 12 horsepower

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.479 
i think approximately 10 12 horsepower
and<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:45.280> makes<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.610> difference<00:02:45.820> between

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and that makes a difference between

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.430 
and that makes a difference between
shifting<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:49.750> from<00:02:50.140> 42<00:02:50.890> seconds

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.860 

and<00:02:55.440> merging<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> freeway<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
and merging on the freeway and now you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.460 
and merging on the freeway and now you
can<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.350> merge<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.920> fur<00:02:59.400> gear<00:02:59.700> without<00:03:00.470> any

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can just merge in fur gear without any

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.960 
can just merge in fur gear without any
problem<00:03:02.060> mileage<00:03:03.060> wise<00:03:04.250> well<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.400> used<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.760> run

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
problem mileage wise well it used to run

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
problem mileage wise well it used to run
like<00:03:06.300> 20<00:03:06.660> miles<00:03:06.840> per<00:03:06.959> gallon<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.650> guess<00:03:07.920> now

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
like 20 miles per gallon I guess now

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.510 
like 20 miles per gallon I guess now
well<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.880> 5<00:03:09.300> 18<00:03:10.050> 19<00:03:10.410> not<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.100> much<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.310> a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
well it's 5 18 19 not so much of a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.090

change pink with the new Oh with a new

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.340 
change pink with the new Oh with a new
exhaust<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:15.330> will<00:03:15.570> improve<00:03:15.870> over<00:03:16.170> time

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
exhaust it will improve over time

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.470 
exhaust it will improve over time
because<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> engine<00:03:17.520> doesn't<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.240> work

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
because the engine doesn't have to work

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.699 
because the engine doesn't have to work
as<00:03:18.630> hard<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.100> old<00:03:20.280> one<00:03:20.550> was<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:22.380> Midas

door panels and added some insulation
what<00:03:44.940> i'm<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.330> do<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.570> add<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.350> little

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
what i'm going to do is add a little

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.700 
what i'm going to do is add a little
insulation<00:03:47.220> yeah<00:03:48.530> behind<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> back<00:03:49.769> seat<00:03:49.980> and

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
insulation yeah behind the back seat and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.930 
insulation yeah behind the back seat and
you<00:03:52.040> know<00:03:52.130> then<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.430> will<00:03:52.580> be<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> little

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
you know then it will be a little

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.370 
you know then it will be a little
quieter<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:54.050> new<00:03:54.170> exhaust<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.800> great<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
quieter and a new exhaust is great and

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.660 
quieter and a new exhaust is great and
definitely<00:03:57.380> an<00:03:57.500> improvement<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.980> power<00:03:58.280> but

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
definitely an improvement in power but

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.470 
definitely an improvement in power but
then<00:03:59.320> also<00:04:00.850> at<00:04:01.850> speeds<00:04:02.300> let's<00:04:02.960> say<00:04:03.110> around<00:04:04.480> 70

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
then also at speeds let's say around 70

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.190 
then also at speeds let's say around 70
75<00:04:06.140> miles<00:04:06.410> an<00:04:06.530> hour<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:07.940> resonates<00:04:08.480> epid

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
75 miles an hour it just resonates epid

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.390 
75 miles an hour it just resonates epid
and<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:10.370> resonates<00:04:10.880> yeah<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.570> mean<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:13.040> an<00:04:13.190> area

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
that has gone up obviously after all the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.300 
that has gone up obviously after all the
work<00:04:37.880> i<00:04:38.270> think<00:04:38.810> i<00:04:39.020> spent<00:04:39.290> like<00:04:39.410> three<00:04:39.800> thousand

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
work i think i spent like three thousand

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.190 
work i think i spent like three thousand
four<00:04:41.270> three<00:04:41.450> thousand<00:04:41.870> dollars<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.500> and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
four three thousand dollars on it and

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.280 
four three thousand dollars on it and
let's<00:04:45.200> say<00:04:45.440> okay<00:04:45.860> if<00:04:46.070> i<00:04:46.280> add<00:04:46.490> half<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.000> that

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
let's say okay if i add half of that

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.700 
let's say okay if i add half of that
then<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:49.070> car<00:04:49.370> would<00:04:49.550> cost<00:04:49.850> 4k<00:04:50.710> four

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
then this car would cost 4k four

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.700 
then this car would cost 4k four
thousand<00:04:52.280> dollars<00:04:52.310> which<00:04:53.060> is<00:04:53.200> definitely<00:04:54.200> not

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
thousand dollars which is definitely not

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.220 
thousand dollars which is definitely not
a<00:04:54.980> penny<00:04:55.310> too<00:04:55.550> much<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:56.450> definitely<00:04:56.600> worth

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
a penny too much it's definitely worth

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.650 
a penny too much it's definitely worth
every<00:04:57.620> penny<00:04:57.770> of<00:04:57.920> that<00:04:58.010> left<00:04:58.790> 4,000<00:04:59.390> bucks<00:04:59.540> so

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
every penny of that left 4,000 bucks so

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.130 
every penny of that left 4,000 bucks so
um<00:05:00.820> what<00:05:01.820> else<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.150> there<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.360> say<00:05:02.510> well<00:05:02.930> the
