00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 moin moin and welcome to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.950
 sting soccer camp in this video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.240
 I'll tell you poker in German 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.160
 explain today letter a yes then lay 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 We also go immediately at the tap 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 There are, among other things, the well-liked 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.230
 word action action denotes a high 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.529
 activity in the current betting round the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.630
 for example through races and rhi races 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 is caused 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 action is what you want to have when 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.290
 you keep the aces or cinemas or it 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.120
 So went a very strong hand preflop 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 then on the different flops comes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 always in the matter of whether one is the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.570
 action then would like to have or 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 honey next we would have to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.390
 for example, a technical term for aggression 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.399
 Frequency is a word one or the other 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.160
 understood in connection with 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.370
 trecker programs used in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.589
 There is therefore an online portal, among other things 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 For example, printer trecker I believe 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.070
 currently at version 4 or got manager 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.460
 currently in version 2 aggression 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.439
 Frequency means of course translated 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 Aggressive frequency when free 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 that means how to translate 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.460
 aggressively a player for example 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 preflop acts but much three beds 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.790
 or on a so-called 3-bet then a lot 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.650
 Unpack money there you can then in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 context or in interaction with 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.799
 other factors and statistics from the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 Track program on various trends 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.400
 read off and play his game accordingly 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.820
 to adjust 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.770
 furthermore we would have the concept 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.110
 action peter derives from the game of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.540
 black peter and usually hits 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.119
 on the player to the one in a tournament 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 in the bubble phase the smallest stack 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.250
 let's say something like that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.270
 ten big lines as a statkraft and it is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.829
 bubble phase need 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 not just one or two players go 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.349
 then he just has the scan name 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.989
 ass card pulled for and survive 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.810
 and to find the tournament he has to do something 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.090
 make chips so want to accumulate 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.530
 but of course not exactly 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 to be the bubble ball 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.890
 but he has to do what otherwise would be the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.530
 planned away because ten big blinds the 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.720
 then go quickly for the next term 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.379
 many of you will know and know 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.790
 of course what that means is that 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.280
 means nothing other than that someone 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.170
 from the player for example the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 complete chips the more careful 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.430
 has pushed into the middle and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.650
 So make no further decision 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.440
 Of course, for many, one has to be one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.709
 advantage because many have beginners 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.170
 Of course, still some post-flop weakness 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 but well we come to the next concept 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.799
 that would be the beautiful anna kournikova and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.709
 does not mean anything other than that king as 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.239
 start and like the tennis player too 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.230
 looks good but mostly prevents 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.730
 Of course it depends on 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.560
 any range of the opponent one 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.569
 if you wanted to ass with king of course 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.319
 those of an aggressive player 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.720
 is on the way and there testing laboratory 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.630
 breaks out and you here so three to four 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.180
 world five bishop then one lies against 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.850
 a very loose aggressive bismarcks 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.480
 mostly gambling opponents still 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.780
 relatively far ahead against rocks and nitz 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.079
 and solid players can be seen as 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.170
 king in a preflop then already 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.760
 mostly very bad and there must 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.519
 pretty good as a king 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.829
 but then often it is already 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.930
 dominated by better hands the aces 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.510
 and cool warmer with ass king 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.670
 of course blogger keeps is still 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
 probably that the opponent 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.069
 who could say anyway 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.739
 otherwise you run against a premium 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.250
 park usually and that is then 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.349
 mostly coinflip against kriens for example 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.770
 Let's get a concept that would be 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.810
 Ante or only borrowed some 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.180
 poker variants are playing with grandson 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.400
 For example, the duck is then one 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 Forced a set every player 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.660
 otherwise he has to get it 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.000
 no cards under operation also in new ones 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.710
 with hold'em tournaments and cash games 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.830
 but rather in tournaments than inter stands 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.150
 usually after a few levels then 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.460
 finally introduced 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.250
 then the pot will be natural 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.919
 preflop a bit more lucrative about that 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.340
 to fight and breastfeed from lake 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.520
 position so asked kardorf to everyone 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.090
 more profitable and the final term for 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.310
 today's consequence is the MTM is the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.820
 term for ATM from the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.850
 English 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.330
 in poker describes that course 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.550
 it once freizeitspieler the constant money 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.860
 lose so that's it then already 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.200
 more for today's success a poker 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.300
 Just explained terms here stinks 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.470
 I know that you know poker 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.390
 i liked how long i can 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.360
 of course for every thumb on it 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.800
 every stimulating creative commentary and 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.470
 subscribe is natural as always 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.970
 For free so skin in the keys and 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.700
 will also switch again next time 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.430
 A simple name when it is called 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.530
 declares castings program until then 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.530
 until recently adios
