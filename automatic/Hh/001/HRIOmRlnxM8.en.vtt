theory during this video this video is

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.100 
theory during this video this video is
intended<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.980> prove<00:00:32.310> that<00:00:32.579> natural<00:00:33.510> selection

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
is the main driving force of evolution

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
is the main driving force of evolution

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
therefore every living species today is

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.960 
therefore every living species today is
