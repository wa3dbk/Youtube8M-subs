 660 cubes 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.580
 some weird 3 cylinder 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.530
 driver's layout 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.400
 falls and rises one of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.930
 passenger glass does nothing 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.910
 stands in his tracks but at the bottom of the door 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.210
 have cloth shower curtain it is necessary to 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.040
 twist for airing it probably 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.010
 the strangest vehicle on 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.720
 which i just drove equals group 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.630
 the kids are laughing at me on the street 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:38.350
 I leave just stand and laughs at me 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.350
 I'm a little ashamed to be honest with widgets 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.670
 dumb street I have not met my 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.229
 life is nothing like this midget 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 to get out of here you need to do 4 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.679
 full turn of the steering wheel I'm not kidding 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.610
 here is one two three four turns 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.600
 you have to work like a drift 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.829
 wheelbarrow even without drift sorry I would 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.849
 gladly brought such a thing in 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:13.540
 Australia now pritplyu seen at 2 40 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.329
 on the third flooded 70 ganter hour 4 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.569
 fly out at speed 80 in this turn 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:22.930
 very scary 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.349
 90 small midget rides well in this 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.349
 no doubt 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:35.790
 about a speed bump for midget times 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
 spit 660 cubes enough even 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.080
 too much 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.940
 just incredibly maybe a little name 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.450
 politically and slippery rome you are some 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.280
 play on words but herself. I will just call in 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.530
 on the bear a magic and and even 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 I switch to the second automatic 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.780
 turn signals off there is no need 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.280
 turn off yourself as far as I remember this 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.050
 the little midget was used locally 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.080
 shopping center for towing carts and 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.030
 all this in this regard is just 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.940
 perfect car brakes a little 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.290
 bluff and so here in this regard it 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.090
 just a perfect car a lot 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.520
 gasoline it with another especially nobody 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.440
 bothers me noisy + design and appearance 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.750
 exact interesting think in some way 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.250
 it benefits people attracts the moon 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.320
 and care your service a lot of heads 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.260
 turned my way out to me only 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.190
 I like it but oh 5 there is no 4 all 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.190

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.620
