00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
anything else now if you wanted to do an

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
anything else now if you wanted to do an
android<00:01:33.960> device<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.530> gets<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.430> bit<00:01:35.670> more

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
android device it gets a little bit more

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
android device it gets a little bit more
confusing<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:36.930> different<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
confusing and a little bit different so

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
confusing and a little bit different so
instead<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> having<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> would

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
instead of having just what you would

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469 
instead of having just what you would
have<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.560> apple<00:01:40.950> ipad<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:42.060> would<00:01:42.270> be

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
have for your apple ipad which would be

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.580 
have for your apple ipad which would be
a<00:01:42.659> adapter<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.820> MHL<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.049> HDMI

that<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.840> issue<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.799> has

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that is it but the issue here this has

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.609 
that is it but the issue here this has
HDCP<00:01:59.909> protection<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.259> means

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
HDCP protection which basically means

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.420 
HDCP protection which basically means
that<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.090> send<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> video<00:02:05.100> if

nope and there's no way to get around
on<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> unless<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.310> buy<00:02:14.490> one<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.180> these<00:02:15.390> now

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
on it unless you buy one of these now

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.840 
on it unless you buy one of these now
this<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.680> probably<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.520> thing<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this is probably the the thing you

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.250 
this is probably the the thing you
didn't<00:02:18.240> know<00:02:18.330> about<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.780> you're<00:02:18.930> trying<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> do

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
didn't know about if you're trying to do

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.050 
didn't know about if you're trying to do
your<00:02:19.410> Android<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> haitch<00:02:20.700> d<00:02:20.730> mi

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
your Android this is a haitch d mi

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.090 
your Android this is a haitch d mi
splitter<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.900> 1<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.350> 2<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.070> basically

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
splitter this is a 1 to 2 so basically

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.970 
splitter this is a 1 to 2 so basically
it<00:02:23.550> splits<00:02:23.820> one<00:02:24.030> HDMI<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> 2<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.830> also

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it splits one HDMI to 2 but it also

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.180 
it splits one HDMI to 2 but it also
strips<00:02:26.630> HDCP<00:02:27.630> content<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.710> strips<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
strips HDCP content so it strips the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.640 
strips HDCP content so it strips the
copy<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:29.640> now<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.840> get<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.200> work<00:02:31.350> what

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
copy right now to get this to work what

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.020 
copy right now to get this to work what
you'll<00:02:31.770> need<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.400> you'll<00:02:32.610> need<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.850> find

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you'll need to do is you'll need to find

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
you'll need to do is you'll need to find
another<00:02:33.180> HDMI<00:02:33.810> cable<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.290> likely<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:35.040> one

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
another HDMI cable I likely have one

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.300 
another HDMI cable I likely have one
just<00:02:35.550> here<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.910> you're<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.140> plug<00:02:37.500> from

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
just here and you're going to plug from

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.750 
just here and you're going to plug from
your<00:02:38.610> Android<00:02:39.030> device<00:02:39.440> into<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.860> HDMI<00:02:41.520> and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
your Android device into your HDMI and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.250 
your Android device into your HDMI and
then<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.810> HDMI<00:02:43.410> goes<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> input<00:02:45.570> here

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
then this HDMI goes to the input here

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500 
then this HDMI goes to the input here
now<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.850> important<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.390> you're

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
now this is really important if you're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.880 
now this is really important if you're
going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> buy<00:02:48.810> one<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.050> these<00:02:49.200> make<00:02:49.590> sure<00:02:49.770> you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
going to buy one of these make sure you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.680 
going to buy one of these make sure you
get<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.070> powered<00:02:50.520> one<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> power

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
get a powered one so there is a power

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.050 
get a powered one so there is a power
cable<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:52.290> can't<00:02:52.860> find<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.820> power

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
cable I can't find it but this power

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.050 
cable I can't find it but this power
cable<00:02:54.390> will<00:02:54.570> go<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.410> wall<00:02:55.830> socket<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.580> you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
cable will go to the wall socket and you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.660 
cable will go to the wall socket and you
do<00:02:57.300> need<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.630> powered<00:02:57.960> on<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:59.190> that's<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.520> if

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
do need it powered on but that's it if

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.890 
do need it powered on but that's it if
you<00:02:59.760> get<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.120> isn't<00:03:00.270> powered<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.750> it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you get one that isn't powered on it

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
you get one that isn't powered on it
won't<00:03:01.200> strip<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> HDCP<00:03:02.160> content<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.820> then

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
won't strip the HDCP content and then

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.510 
won't strip the HDCP content and then
you<00:03:03.510> need<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> plug<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.310> other

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
you need to plug this in to the other

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.090 
you need to plug this in to the other
side<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> goes<00:03:07.830> into

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
side like that and then this goes into

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.250 
side like that and then this goes into
your<00:03:08.310> el<00:03:08.370> gato<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> only

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
your el gato and that is it so the only

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.870 
your el gato and that is it so the only
difference<00:03:10.440> really<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.640> box

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
difference really is this little box

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.960 
difference really is this little box
which<00:03:12.720> strips<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.320> HDCP<00:03:13.950> content<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:14.610> then

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
which strips the HDCP content and then

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.660 
which strips the HDCP content and then
when<00:03:15.120> you've<00:03:15.240> gone<00:03:15.360> here<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> will<00:03:17.400> be<00:03:17.490> other

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
when you've gone here you will be other
