program I've seen a lot of programs like

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
program I've seen a lot of programs like
this<00:01:01.950> on<00:01:02.100> youtube<00:01:02.310> but<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:03.000> ask<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.330> for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this on youtube but they ask you for

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.540 
this on youtube but they ask you for
your<00:01:03.540> password<00:01:03.660> man<00:01:04.440> it's<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.920> an<00:01:05.100> obviously

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
your password man it's like an obviously

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.670 
your password man it's like an obviously
trying<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> steal<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.120> account<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.470> only

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
trying to steal your account this only

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.230 
trying to steal your account this only
asks<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> username<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.000> only<00:01:09.150> reason

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
asks for a username and the only reason

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.150 
asks for a username and the only reason
it<00:01:09.600> does<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.470> verifies<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
it does that is because it verifies the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.980 
it does that is because it verifies the
code<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.550> generates<00:01:11.910> with<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.300> username<00:01:12.600> for

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
code it generates with your username for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
code it generates with your username for
amazon<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.460> activate

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
amazon so that you can actually activate

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
amazon so that you can actually activate
it<00:01:15.180> instead<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.480> it<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.900> working<00:01:16.610> okay<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
it instead of it not working okay so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.290 
it instead of it not working okay so
here<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.140> type<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.260> your<00:01:19.350> username<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:23.300> I

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
here you go type in your username and I

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.500 
here you go type in your username and I
will<00:01:24.510> blow<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:26.120> I'll<00:01:27.120> generate<00:01:27.480> a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
will blow this out I'll generate a

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.220 
will blow this out I'll generate a
ten-dollar<00:01:27.960> code<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.930> i'll<00:01:30.930> start

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
ten-dollar code and i'll start

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.230 
ten-dollar code and i'll start
generation<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.370> connects<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> Amazon

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
generation so it connects to the Amazon

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
generation so it connects to the Amazon
service<00:01:33.600> connecting<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.260> my<00:01:34.380> account<00:01:34.710> finding

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
service connecting to my account finding

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.970 
service connecting to my account finding
an<00:01:35.550> algorithm<00:01:36.409> algorithm<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.740> found

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
an algorithm algorithm is found

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.570 
an algorithm algorithm is found
generating<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.760> code<00:01:40.070> verifying<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.190> code<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
generating the code verifying the code I

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.820 
generating the code verifying the code I
it's<00:01:41.790> sweet<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.270> verified<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.080> there<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.800> is

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it's sweet it verified and there it is

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.040 
it's sweet it verified and there it is
let's<00:01:44.190> open<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.550> notepad<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.240> copy<00:01:45.510> this<00:01:45.780> code

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
let's open up notepad and copy this code

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:56.090 
let's open up notepad and copy this code
down<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> guys<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.860> copy

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
down so I guys I'm just going to copy

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.149 
down so I guys I'm just going to copy
this<00:01:56.400> down<00:01:56.460> from<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.940> program

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.190 

okay<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.220> we're<00:02:03.430> going<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> copy<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.210> we're

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
okay so we're going to copy that we're

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.140 
okay so we're going to copy that we're
going<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.409> go<00:02:05.620> into<00:02:05.920> our<00:02:06.100> amazon<00:02:06.550> account<00:02:06.850> I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
going to go into our amazon account I

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to go into our amazon account I
already<00:02:07.510> have<00:02:07.690> twenty<00:02:07.960> dollars<00:02:08.259> in<00:02:08.289> here<00:02:08.649> from

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
already have twenty dollars in here from

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.540 
already have twenty dollars in here from
redeeming<00:02:09.369> codes<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:11.130> let's<00:02:12.130> see<00:02:12.220> if<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.400> can

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
redeeming codes and let's see if I can

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.570 
redeeming codes and let's see if I can
make<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.790> 30<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> let's<00:02:14.560> apply<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:14.950> code<00:02:15.400> to
