00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
think this is kind of bad but I gained a

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.650 
think this is kind of bad but I gained a
little<00:04:02.670> bit<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:02.910> weight<00:04:03.060> after<00:04:03.299> had<00:04:03.540> our

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
little bit of weight after had our

daughter and that's when it kind of

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.410 
daughter and that's when it kind of
started<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.940> has<00:04:06.060> something

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420
