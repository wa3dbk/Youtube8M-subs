show<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.300> guys<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.079> looks<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.270> take<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
show you guys how it looks and take it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
show you guys how it looks and take it
from<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.899> until<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.320> let's<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.950> down

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
from there but until then let's get down

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.000 
from there but until then let's get down
to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> action<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.930> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.260> course<00:00:49.289> as

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to the action here this is of course as

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.170 
to the action here this is of course as
you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.370> tell<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.149> action-packed

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
you can tell you know it's action-packed

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
you can tell you know it's action-packed
i<00:00:54.180> guess<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.079> say<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> non-stop<00:00:55.620> action

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
i guess i could say it's non-stop action

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.849 
i guess i could say it's non-stop action
because<00:00:56.930> we're<00:00:57.930> pretty<00:00:58.109> much<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.440> their<00:00:58.680> base

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
because we're pretty much at their base

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.790 
because we're pretty much at their base
just<00:00:59.340> not<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.300> spawn<00:01:00.600> camping<00:01:00.899> them<00:01:01.140> but

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
just not really spawn camping them but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.369 
just not really spawn camping them but
we're<00:01:02.010> keeping<00:01:02.250> them<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.699> bay<00:01:03.049> because<00:01:04.049> we

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
we're keeping them at bay because we

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.679 
we're keeping them at bay because we
have<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.769> guy<00:01:04.979> doing<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> objective<00:01:05.909> which

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
have one guy doing the objective which

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.530 
have one guy doing the objective which
is<00:01:06.720> i<00:01:07.080> believe<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> heroes<00:01:08.909> base<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.510> have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is i believe the heroes base they have

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.980 
is i believe the heroes base they have
that<00:01:09.750> kryptonite<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> big<00:01:11.130> black

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that kryptonite like a big black

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
that kryptonite like a big black
kryptonite<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> take<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
kryptonite and we got to take that to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
kryptonite and we got to take that to
our<00:01:15.000> base<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.600> hold<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
our base and hold it there for like a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.109 
our base and hold it there for like a
few<00:01:16.830> seconds<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.280> something<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
few seconds or something like that so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.999 
few seconds or something like that so
we're<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.140> defending<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.799> guy

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
we're pretty much defending that guy

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.510 
we're pretty much defending that guy
he's<00:01:20.460> doing<00:01:20.640> objective<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.280> do

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
