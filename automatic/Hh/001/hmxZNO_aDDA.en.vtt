00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.670
 after a totally miserable start to the season, the ninth month has to win it 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.280
 It's been a pivotal year in Brazilian Cacau's life. "He was three times 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.060
 he has become world champion but the last title win is already three years 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.069
 back 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:18.009
 after ten years in the business the stations as a veteran of the formula 1 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.499
 but he still has a big goal in mind he wants the Justus record 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.239
 five times world champion break this goal in the eyes of the sender several months 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.020
 previously the team of McLaren with whom he had previously won everything 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.999
 he switched to Williams Renault 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.250
 the racing team 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.280
 who won the last World Cup with Frenchman Anna Trost 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.070
 Researchers had dreamed about the pond, he changed the title page 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.400
 Macquarie left where the drivers are treated with great respect 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.330
 when explaining 28 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.700
 at Williams that was not the case then work that is through and through 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.740
 a British team and I would call the atmosphere cool 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.590
 so 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.360
 all the protests the year before when he drove for Williams in 1993 gave me that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.140
 This may also have affected his on July of last Sunday 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.720
 Beer thus consumed noticeable recognition of the Formula 1 driver 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 Ultimately very lonely are doing Ospel Triple from the moment you enter the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.310
 Car takes a seat and put on his helmet you are all alone 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840
 missed a meter so you need someone at his side governs the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.610
 Authors need to feel the collective team spirit that needs hundreds of people 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 In such a room Trier behind you are the Frohnatur and I do not think so 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.260
 that this was the case with Williams Chen 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.190
 their post represents a local one this will be the team with the best cars and 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.080
 obviously to have the fastest car on the telgter and immediately 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.509
 To become world champion 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.249
 but from a technical point of view he soon realized that the car was far 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.049
 far from what he had dreamed of, in truth, the car was pretty 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.060
 sensitive at high speeds and did not raft his drivers straight 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.439
 For trust a Baird and put this very quickly was already at the first 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.690
 Test rounds firmly in a few weeks before the start of the season, he knew that it was very 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.850
 Munich would be difficult 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.810
 The car was technically not too successful 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.009
 Although he was potentially very fast, this potential only remained 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.860
 Within close limits, our team and my view would only be one 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 really gifted driver has been able to Inc within this very tight 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 Scope to be able to extend 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.339
 and I remember well here came to me and said in Bonn the car is very 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.699
 hard to drive the ferries the Namib is not something we need that 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.950
 At present, the car is not competitive Damon 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.459
 nevertheless, at the beginning of session 94, he managed to get the Portuguese one 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 that was not his merit the Legal Committee got something off 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.489
 when old Senna arrives in Imola he may not have his new car yet 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.309
 befits 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.569
 but he is still the undisputed king of controlling there pulls 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.219
 only the speed
