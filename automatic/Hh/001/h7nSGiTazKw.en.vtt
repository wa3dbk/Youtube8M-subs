00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
some of the fabric I have on the table

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.510 
some of the fabric I have on the table
here<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.720> am<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.200> cut

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.600 

three<00:01:47.520> inches<00:01:47.730> wide<00:01:48.440> so<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:49.470> line<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:50.340> line

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
three inches wide so I line my line

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.970 
three inches wide so I line my line
three<00:01:51.150> inch<00:01:51.360> line<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.530> edge<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
three inch line up with the edge of the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.420 
three inch line up with the edge of the
fabric<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.780> make<00:01:54.960> sure<00:01:55.230> that<00:01:55.980> horizontal

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
fabric and I make sure that horizontal

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.350 
fabric and I make sure that horizontal
line<00:01:56.760> is<00:01:57.090> even<00:01:57.720> with<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.410> edge<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> fabric

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
line is even with the edge of the fabric

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.710 
line is even with the edge of the fabric
because<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:01.050> if<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.400> don't<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.210> will

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
because if I if I don't do that I will

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.810
