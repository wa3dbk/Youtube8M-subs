00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.859 
second but actually I'm just showing you
the<00:00:21.869> program<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.580> use<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the program you do have to use and the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.529 
the program you do have to use and the
coding<00:00:25.519> ok<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.849> coding<00:00:27.210> you're<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
coding ok the coding you're going to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.740 
coding ok the coding you're going to
have<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.320> instead<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> Xcode

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
have to use here instead of Xcode

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.770 
have to use here instead of Xcode
because<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.520> Xcode<00:00:32.520> runs<00:00:33.149> its<00:00:33.360> own<00:00:33.570> basic

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
because I'm Xcode runs its own basic

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
because I'm Xcode runs its own basic
basically<00:00:36.780> their<00:00:36.989> own<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
describe basically like their own run

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.569 
describe basically like their own run
system<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.800> how<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> explain<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
