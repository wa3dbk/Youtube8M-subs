00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 the thermal printer series does not 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 your life tax does not respect the limit 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.220
 speed 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.800
 designed for high performance with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
 print speed of up to 270 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 millimeters per second and low 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 noise is considered the best option for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 establishments that want to make a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 fast service and retain their 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.750
 in-store customers with innovative design and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 high performance is today the printer 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 preferred for establishments that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.940
 print nfc at s 300s possible 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 print speed of 220 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.449
 millimeters per second and s 300 in its 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.430
 version it has 270 millimeters per 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.800
 according to the process of making 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 faster printing by avoiding queues in the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 point of sale 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 so it is clear that printers do not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 Ueda tax laws are ideal for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.090
 fast service establishments and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 with high volume printing because it has 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 structure developed in abs has a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 less noise than other 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 same category in addition to full speed 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.540
 non-fiscal printers 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 ueda also have the quick exchange of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 paper in the easy load system which 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.110
 facilitates insertion of paper 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.420
 supporting coil up to 83 mm 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.759
 diameter is essential for mounting the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.530
 intervals between exchanges and give 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.189
 more agile transactions in the day to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.829
 day 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
 ueda non-tax printers have the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.979
 greater reliability of the market in its 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 category 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.570
 counting on m cbf of 70 million 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.100
 lines that ensures the printing 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.100
 continue for much longer 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 under China has the capacity 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 of a million and a half cuts 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.189
 free from jamming as well as being 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.710
 automatic for your 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.450
 availability of use and economy and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.069
 still the economy with high 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.829
 technical head durability 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.229
 printing up to 150 thousand 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.390
 meters with thermal sensor of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.390
 self-protection and low power consumption 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.370
 non-fiscal printers can 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.310
 be installed in the horizontal and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.709
 vertical or fixed to the wall 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.739
 the possibilities of use without compromising 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.049
 the operation at 300 s and print what you 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.390
 want to support large varieties of 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.000
 printing and logos including your 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.049
 numerous company codes 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.019
 bars 1d code 128 and also 2d with the 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.540
 qr code technology and barcode 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.940
 two-dimensional and thus prepared 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.819
 for new tax technologies 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.010
 the paperless sensor is the device 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.350
 responsible for controlling the quantity 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.989
 user-defined minimum paper 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.329
 to make the exchanges allowing the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.440
 adjustment in five positions for the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.060
 control 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.790
 you can have more connectivity 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.090
 counting with usb outputs in all 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.410
 models and output would have an s 300s and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.549
 ethernet na sp 300 l 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.709
 now let's talk about the interests that 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.079
 only the non - fiscal printers eta 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.690
 has lid impact control 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.690
 with a damping system 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.489
 which reduces impacts on its closure 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.019
 office if you need to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.389
 facilitating the opening of the cabinet to 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.590
 cleaning and maintenance protective cover 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.720
 optional to ensure more protection 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.069
 against liquid in general as per 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.499
 example water 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.439
 looks at the back cover for protection 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:45.689
 the source of the connector connecting cables 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.760
 essential counter for you not to lose
