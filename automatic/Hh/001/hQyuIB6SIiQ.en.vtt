00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.409
 I 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.129
 since we have also come are 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.450
 new seconds that we are here in 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.480
 a new server as they saw in the 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.640
 title the new skywork server this 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.189
 once by the network cookie 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.500
 wheel which is pretty cool and 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.109
 Well this server already had the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.670
 brought earlier and well then I know 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.279
 I have decided to bring this time for the 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.539
 version 0 point 12.1 in all willis 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.820
 whether it's the little bag in which 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.739
 I find in this moment or in the will 8 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 web 9 until the laps that I take out and 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.760
 well then until the official version or 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.250
 final is going to work this server well 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.309
 Well then, without further ado we are going to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.440
 see how this server is divided 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.140
 it's pretty good to remember is the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.260
 culture and then I'll be 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.809
 bringing more servers or more games are 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.969
 game homes for you to 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.160
 they can go more or less and can 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.260
 go see how it deals this time I do not know if 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.640
 I will include a game and we will see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.860
 later to see how it is going 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.460
 because I was earning a bit of the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 by 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.799
 because they were a bit of the ones because 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 as you know a little bit ago they just finished 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 open this server and well then every 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 server when they open a new 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.409
 Minecraft version usually has a little 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.319
 of bach but that is taking away every 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 day then there was a subscriber 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.849

 servers like de faction in hook and 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.780
 It has two modes pretty wild game 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.140

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.050
 all that when I was bringing them 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.870

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.680
 I will be bringing it since inviting him 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.670
 as you know it is something 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.409
 you can not say because he does not have much 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.260
 reason all that so when it's a 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.489
 age a lot and this I do not know who what 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.540
 want 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.960
 well maybe I'll do it's not here 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.270
 is a hard norm why 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.840
 good if maybe the love of your 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.910
 good and please do not know what you want 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.019
 although more and of this man dad who 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.329
 well let's see him see what 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.930
 He tells me how good he can do 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.419
 a trap and when we get down we can 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.900
 attack and you can not advance and I hope 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.900
 win this game 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.259
 as you have great virtue is good because 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.020
 you tell me the question let's go 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.389
 answering and remember that the bng or 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.020
 youtube I have it because I have more than 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.020
 thousand subscribers 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.190
 I have more than a thousand subscribers so 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.470
 after more than a thousand subscribers 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.979
 have an opportunity to obtain the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.979
 youtube rank 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.030
 and if we win the game as they could 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.669
 see there appears if it was a year and 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.169
 sub-19 one and well then here we have already 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.449
 finished the game and well we have 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.700
 come out victorious so do not forget 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:23.130
 to like it since it is like 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.020
 encourages me more to continue raising these 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.580
 types of server videos and all that 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.080
 so well then, without more to say no
