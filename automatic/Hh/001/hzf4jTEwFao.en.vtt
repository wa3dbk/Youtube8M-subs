EBG<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.639> plastic<00:03:28.030> hood<00:03:28.209> off<00:03:28.359> because<00:03:29.109> I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
EBG I do the plastic hood off because I

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.090 
EBG I do the plastic hood off because I
think<00:03:29.260> against<00:03:29.650> better<00:03:29.829> air<00:03:30.069> circulation

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
think against better air circulation

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.680 
think against better air circulation
especially<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.000> will<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.420> stream

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
especially this will have the stream

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.470 
especially this will have the stream
fans<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.139> here<00:03:32.170> if<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.280> turns<00:03:33.459> out<00:03:33.609> with<00:03:34.359> this

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
fans out here if it turns out with this

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.030 
fans out here if it turns out with this
control

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040 

it<00:03:39.040> goes<00:03:39.250> here<00:03:39.520> directly<00:03:40.000> onto<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.390> pins<00:03:40.750> of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
it goes here directly onto the pins of

it goes here directly onto the pins of
the<00:03:41.110> video<00:03:41.830> part<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:44.400> temperature<00:03:45.400> goes<00:03:45.550> down

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the video part so temperature goes down

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.870 
the video part so temperature goes down
by<00:03:46.090> about<00:03:46.210> 10<00:03:46.570> degrees<00:03:46.690> Celsius<00:03:47.640> with<00:03:48.640> the
