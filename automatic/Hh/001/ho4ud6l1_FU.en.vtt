00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
right here yes I miss timing and I think

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
right here yes I miss timing and I think
I<00:00:35.070> miss<00:00:35.219> time<00:00:35.399> another<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.850> later<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.570> uh

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I miss time another one later on but uh

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
I miss time another one later on but uh
if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.530> super<00:00:37.890> punch<00:00:38.100> him<00:00:38.250> while<00:00:38.460> he's<00:00:38.640> trying

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
if you super punch him while he's trying

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.160 
if you super punch him while he's trying
to<00:00:38.969> drain<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.300> life<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.780> catch<00:00:39.930> him<00:00:40.079> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to drain your life you can catch him in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
to drain your life you can catch him in
an<00:00:40.260> infinite<00:00:40.649> loop<00:00:40.829> which<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.489> makes

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
an infinite loop which actually makes

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
an infinite loop which actually makes
him<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:41.969> easy<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.450> beat<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.410> also

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
him really easy to beat and it also

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
him really easy to beat and it also
means<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> avoid<00:00:44.430> his<00:00:44.700> flurry<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
means you can avoid his flurry of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
means you can avoid his flurry of
punches<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:46.050> takes<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.500> 30<00:00:46.739> seconds<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
punches which takes like 30 seconds that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
punches which takes like 30 seconds that
could<00:00:47.579> pretty<00:00:47.760> easily<00:00:47.850> knock<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.110> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
could pretty easily knock you out if you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.240 
could pretty easily knock you out if you
don't<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.649> doing<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> that's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
don't know what you're doing and that's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.639 
don't know what you're doing and that's
this<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this right here so you know because I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.250 
this right here so you know because I
botched<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.120> two<00:00:54.329> attempts<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:55.079> gonna

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
botched my first two attempts I'm gonna

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
botched my first two attempts I'm gonna
have<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> deal<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.860> him<00:00:55.980> punching<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
have to deal with him punching for a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.209 
have to deal with him punching for a
while<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.300> over<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:58.469> I'd<00:00:58.980> I'd

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
while but I get over it I think I'd I'd

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
while but I get over it I think I'd I'd
missed<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> again<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.719> guy<00:01:00.870> really

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
missed it again you see this guy really

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.549 
missed it again you see this guy really
still<00:01:02.160> gives<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> trouble

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
still gives me a little bit of trouble

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.479 
still gives me a little bit of trouble
so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.070> looking<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so you know if you're looking for a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
so you know if you're looking for a
speedrun<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.900> Aaron<00:01:07.229> Ryan<00:01:07.500> fight<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
speedrun of an Aaron Ryan fight I'm

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.570 
speedrun of an Aaron Ryan fight I'm
probably<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> guy<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> other

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
probably not the guy to go to the other

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
probably not the guy to go to the other
reason<00:01:11.850> he's<00:01:11.939> difficult<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.570> he's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
reason he's difficult is because he's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
reason he's difficult is because he's
basically<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.340> same<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.700> piston

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
basically just the same as piston

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.380 
basically just the same as piston
hurricane<00:01:15.479> except<00:01:16.020> stronger<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.520> guess<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
hurricane except stronger and I guess a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
hurricane except stronger and I guess a
little<00:01:18.570> bit<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:18.840> defensive<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.000> go

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
little bit more defensive so there we go

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
little bit more defensive so there we go
I<00:01:21.150> finally<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:21.750> him<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.680> piston<00:01:23.070> hurricane

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
I finally got him and a piston hurricane

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
I finally got him and a piston hurricane
I<00:01:23.670> got<00:01:24.060> stuck<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.390> him<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> while<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> kid

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I got stuck on him for a while as a kid

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.630 
I got stuck on him for a while as a kid
too<00:01:25.650> even<00:01:25.920> though<00:01:25.979> he's<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> third

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
too even though he's only the third

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.310 
too even though he's only the third
opponent<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.900> guy<00:01:31.049> goes<00:01:31.290> down

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
opponent so I think this guy goes down

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.179 
opponent so I think this guy goes down
not<00:01:32.220> too<00:01:32.460> long<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.110> he's<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.710> really

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
not too long from now he's really really

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
not too long from now he's really really
a<00:01:35.220> step<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> people<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> major

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a step up from the people in the major

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.690 
a step up from the people in the major
circuit<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> say<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> least<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> yeah<00:01:38.430> there

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
circuit to say the least and yeah there

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
circuit to say the least and yeah there
you<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.390> too<00:01:39.600> bad<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> minute

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you go so that's not too bad a minute

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
you go so that's not too bad a minute
three<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> yeah<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:41.939> where<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> game

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
three but yeah this is where the game

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
three but yeah this is where the game
really<00:01:42.420> starts<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> ramp<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.380> any<00:01:43.560> difficulty

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really starts to ramp up any difficulty

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.690 
really starts to ramp up any difficulty
I<00:01:44.189> mean<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.689> pretty<00:01:46.140> easily<00:01:46.430> lose<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I mean you could pretty easily lose to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
I mean you could pretty easily lose to
anybody<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> world<00:01:48.509> circuit<00:01:48.810> even<00:01:49.110> if

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
anybody on the world circuit even if

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
anybody on the world circuit even if
you're<00:01:49.350> someone<00:01:49.770> well-versed<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> game<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you're someone well-versed in the game I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
you're someone well-versed in the game I
mean<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.119> you've<00:01:51.329> played<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.899> 15

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
mean after you've played it for like 15

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.310 
mean after you've played it for like 15
years<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.899> probably<00:01:55.110> not

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
years as I have then you're probably not

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
years as I have then you're probably not
gonna<00:01:55.530> mess<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> new<00:01:56.909> players

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
gonna mess up but a new players

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819 
gonna mess up but a new players
definitely<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.020> big<00:01:58.350> step<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
definitely this is a big step up in

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
definitely this is a big step up in
difficulty<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> Kiki<00:02:00.060> Kagero<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
difficulty so you have a Kiki Kagero and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
difficulty so you have a Kiki Kagero and
when<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> kid<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> had<00:02:02.579> big<00:02:03.000> arguments<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
when I was a kid I had big arguments of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
when I was a kid I had big arguments of
my<00:02:03.689> friends<00:02:04.079> over<00:02:04.170> whether<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> guy<00:02:05.070> or

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
my friends over whether this is a guy or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
my friends over whether this is a guy or
a<00:02:05.310> girl<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.820> mean<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.600> got<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> long<00:02:07.079> hair

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
a girl I mean they got the long hair

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.100 
a girl I mean they got the long hair
that<00:02:07.740> drawn<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.580> purple<00:02:09.390> eyeshadow<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that drawn on purple eyeshadow the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.540 
that drawn on purple eyeshadow the
purple<00:02:10.410> accessories<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
purple accessories so you think it's a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.660 
purple accessories so you think it's a
girl<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.569> then<00:02:12.690> he<00:02:13.260> or<00:02:13.470> she<00:02:13.500> boxes<00:02:14.310> without<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
girl but then he or she boxes without a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.059 
girl but then he or she boxes without a
shirt<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.209> there's<00:02:15.840> no<00:02:16.080> real<00:02:16.680> breasts

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
shirt on and there's no real breasts

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.130 
shirt on and there's no real breasts
that<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.550> see<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.090> guess<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.720> gotta<00:02:18.959> be

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
that I can see so I guess it's gotta be

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.470 
that I can see so I guess it's gotta be
a<00:02:19.170> guy<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.489> any<00:02:20.700> case<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.300> safe

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
a guy but in any case I think it's safe

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110 
a guy but in any case I think it's safe
to<00:02:21.629> say<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.810> geeky<00:02:22.410> kagero<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.099> as<00:02:23.340> confused

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to say that geeky kagero is as confused

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.369 
to say that geeky kagero is as confused
as<00:02:24.360> he<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.660> she<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.840> defusing<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.239> um<00:02:27.569> again

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
as he or she is defusing so um again

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.199 
as he or she is defusing so um again
there's<00:02:28.739> no<00:02:28.860> trick<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> beating<00:02:29.640> her<00:02:29.819> except

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
there's no trick to beating her except

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.820 
there's no trick to beating her except
sometimes<00:02:30.750> she'll<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.410> thing<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.769> you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
sometimes she'll do this thing that you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.699 
sometimes she'll do this thing that you
just<00:02:32.040> saw<00:02:32.220> where<00:02:32.489> she<00:02:32.519> kind<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:32.910> phases<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.379> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
just saw where she kind of phases in and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.430 
just saw where she kind of phases in and
out<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.660> super<00:02:36.989> punch<00:02:37.200> her<00:02:37.290> out

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
out and if you can super punch her out

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.080 
out and if you can super punch her out
of<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:37.980> an<00:02:38.099> awful<00:02:38.220> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.489> damage

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
of that you do an awful lot of damage

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.650 
of that you do an awful lot of damage
she's<00:02:39.629> probably<00:02:40.140> he<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.590> she<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.640> probably<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
she's probably he or she is probably the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.589 
she's probably he or she is probably the
easiest<00:02:43.050> player<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.370> easiest<00:02:44.730> boxer<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
easiest player the easiest boxer on the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.790 
easiest player the easiest boxer on the
world<00:02:45.900> circuit<00:02:47.750> yeah<00:02:48.750> yeah<00:02:49.019> just<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.470> pretty

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
world circuit yeah yeah just a pretty

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.350 
world circuit yeah yeah just a pretty
standard<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.280> move<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.970> way<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.150> her

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
standard just move out of the way of her

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
easy as Faragher obviously considering

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.250 
easy as Faragher obviously considering
this<00:03:53.159> point<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.580> game<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.390> he<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.900> pretty

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
this point in the game but he is pretty

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.710 
this point in the game but he is pretty
easy<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:56.220> lot<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.879> those<00:03:56.970> punches<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.599> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
easy a lot of those punches like the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.539 
easy a lot of those punches like the
back<00:03:57.900> slap<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.349> just<00:03:58.560> saw<00:03:58.709> will<00:03:59.069> do<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.220> lot<00:03:59.519> of

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
back slap you just saw will do a lot of

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.420 
back slap you just saw will do a lot of
damage<00:03:59.849> to<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.480> that's<00:04:00.840> his<00:04:01.200> uh<00:04:01.230> his<00:04:01.739> main

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
damage to you and that's his uh his main

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220 
damage to you and that's his uh his main
strength<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.939> guess<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.390> his<00:04:03.599> attack

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
strength I guess is that his attack

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.320 
strength I guess is that his attack
power<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.620> very<00:04:04.860> strong<00:04:05.159> if<00:04:05.790> he<00:04:05.909> catches<00:04:06.239> you

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
power is very strong if he catches you

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.610 
power is very strong if he catches you
with<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.659> one<00:04:06.840> he<00:04:07.019> drains<00:04:07.290> your<00:04:07.439> life

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
with that one he drains your life

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.350 
with that one he drains your life

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.440 
where he does the front flip and then
catches<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.550> on<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.760> head<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.420> a

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
catches you on the head that is a

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.930 
catches you on the head that is a
one-hit<00:04:46.870> ko<00:04:47.020> as<00:04:47.260> well<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.640> game<00:04:48.820> is

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
one-hit ko as well so this game is

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.790 
one-hit ko as well so this game is
really<00:04:49.120> unforgiving<00:04:49.840> for<00:04:50.020> new<00:04:50.140> players<00:04:50.410> but

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
really unforgiving for new players but

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.260 
really unforgiving for new players but
if<00:04:50.920> you've<00:04:51.070> recognized<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.670> patterns<00:04:52.030> you've

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
if you've recognized the patterns you've

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.150 
if you've recognized the patterns you've
got<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.540> memorized<00:04:53.020> then<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.590> not<00:04:53.710> too<00:04:53.920> hard

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
got the memorized then it's not too hard

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.680 
got the memorized then it's not too hard
like<00:04:54.700> it's<00:04:54.880> not<00:04:55.000> hard<00:04:55.120> at<00:04:55.330> all<00:04:55.420> it's<00:04:55.600> actually

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
like it's not hard at all it's actually

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.110 
like it's not hard at all it's actually
quite<00:04:56.050> easy<00:04:56.430> but<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:57.580> know<00:04:57.670> this<00:04:57.790> game<00:04:57.940> gave

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
quite easy but you know this game gave

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.550 
quite easy but you know this game gave
me<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> lot<00:04:58.420> of<00:04:58.450> trouble<00:04:58.630> as<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.930> kid<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.200> probably

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
me a lot of trouble as a kid I probably

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.580 
me a lot of trouble as a kid I probably
got<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.220> when<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> was<00:05:01.110> seven<00:05:02.110> or<00:05:02.200> eight<00:05:02.260> and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
got it when I was seven or eight and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.440 
got it when I was seven or eight and
then<00:05:02.890> I'm<00:05:03.280> pretty<00:05:03.700> sure<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:03.880> didn't<00:05:04.150> beat<00:05:04.300> it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
then I'm pretty sure I didn't beat it

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
then I'm pretty sure I didn't beat it
until<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.780> was<00:05:04.960> at<00:05:05.110> least<00:05:05.290> 10<00:05:06.280> as<00:05:06.430> well<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:07.470> it's

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
until I was at least 10 as well so it's

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.600 
until I was at least 10 as well so it's
one<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.620> those<00:05:08.770> games<00:05:09.010> where<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.220> had<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.400> get<00:05:09.490> my

pretty<00:06:21.910> easily<00:06:22.890> prepare<00:06:23.890> yourself<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.370> dodge

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
pretty easily prepare yourself to dodge

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.510 
pretty easily prepare yourself to dodge
or<00:06:25.030> block<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.690> then<00:06:25.810> counter<00:06:26.110> back<00:06:26.520> yeah

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
or block and then counter back yeah

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.980 
or block and then counter back yeah
seems<00:06:27.790> like<00:06:28.090> I<00:06:28.330> know<00:06:28.390> those<00:06:28.780> are<00:06:28.930> all

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
seems like I know those are all

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.930 
seems like I know those are all
anybody's<00:06:29.440> shots<00:06:29.860> that's<00:06:30.550> really<00:06:30.820> just

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
anybody's shots that's really just

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.100 
anybody's shots that's really just
pattern<00:06:31.330> memorization

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
pattern memorization

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.770 
pattern memorization
this<00:06:33.040> time<00:06:33.310> what<00:06:33.970> he<00:06:34.030> just<00:06:34.240> goes<00:06:34.390> into<00:06:34.600> with

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
this time what he just goes into with

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.170 
this time what he just goes into with
somewhat<00:06:35.170> entre<00:06:35.530> votes<00:06:35.770> you've<00:06:36.730> got<00:06:36.910> to<00:06:37.000> just

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
somewhat entre votes you've got to just

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.550 
somewhat entre votes you've got to just
be<00:06:37.330> ready<00:06:37.510> to<00:06:37.660> duck<00:06:37.840> as<00:06:37.960> many<00:06:38.200> times<00:06:38.440> as

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
be ready to duck as many times as

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.110 
be ready to duck as many times as
possible<00:06:38.800> because<00:06:39.190> you<00:06:39.340> can<00:06:39.490> do<00:06:39.640> it<00:06:39.820> I<00:06:40.090> think

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
possible because you can do it I think

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.020 
possible because you can do it I think
anywhere<00:06:40.960> up<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.260> six<00:06:41.740> times<00:06:41.920> he<00:06:42.730> could<00:06:42.910> only

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
anywhere up to six times he could only

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.640 
anywhere up to six times he could only
do<00:06:43.240> it<00:06:43.360> once<00:06:43.600> but<00:06:43.840> he<00:06:43.870> could<00:06:44.050> do<00:06:44.110> it<00:06:44.230> six<00:06:44.470> times

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
do it once but he could do it six times

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.830 
do it once but he could do it six times
and<00:06:44.980> the<00:06:45.400> worst<00:06:45.640> thing<00:06:45.880> is<00:06:46.060> when<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.480> get<00:06:46.660> up

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
and the worst thing is when you get up

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.270 
and the worst thing is when you get up
thinking<00:06:47.140> is<00:06:47.260> over<00:06:47.560> and<00:06:47.680> then<00:06:47.770> he<00:06:47.830> comes<00:06:48.190> back

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
thinking is over and then he comes back

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.210 
thinking is over and then he comes back
with<00:06:48.400> one<00:06:48.730> more<00:06:48.910> and<00:06:49.030> knocks<00:06:49.210> you<00:06:49.330> out<00:06:50.220> but

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
with one more and knocks you out but

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.350 
with one more and knocks you out but
that<00:06:51.580> being<00:06:51.760> said<00:06:51.850> I<00:06:51.970> have<00:06:52.120> a<00:06:52.180> lot<00:06:52.330> of

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
that being said I have a lot of

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.390 
that being said I have a lot of
experience<00:06:52.990> you<00:06:53.200> know<00:06:53.350> with<00:06:53.560> frustration<00:06:54.250> at

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
experience you know with frustration at

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.060 
experience you know with frustration at
this<00:06:54.550> guy<00:06:54.730> so<00:06:55.090> I'm<00:06:55.900> relatively<00:06:56.590> well<00:06:56.800> versed

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
this guy so I'm relatively well versed

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.380 
this guy so I'm relatively well versed
in<00:06:57.190> what<00:06:57.250> he<00:06:57.430> can<00:06:57.580> throw<00:06:57.790> at<00:06:57.940> you<00:07:00.240> yeah<00:07:01.240> this

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
in what he can throw at you yeah this

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.440 
in what he can throw at you yeah this
guy<00:07:01.600> really<00:07:02.410> really<00:07:02.740> gave<00:07:03.190> me<00:07:03.280> 50<00:07:03.580> as<00:07:03.640> a<00:07:03.730> kid<00:07:03.910> it

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
guy really really gave me 50 as a kid it

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.970 
guy really really gave me 50 as a kid it
took<00:07:04.510> me<00:07:04.750> a<00:07:04.780> long<00:07:04.930> time<00:07:04.990> to<00:07:05.200> realize<00:07:05.590> that<00:07:05.620> this

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:05.980 
took me a long time to realize that this

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.090 
took me a long time to realize that this
wasn't<00:07:06.220> even<00:07:06.430> the<00:07:06.550> last<00:07:06.790> circuit<00:07:07.240> I<00:07:07.330> mean

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
wasn't even the last circuit I mean

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
wasn't even the last circuit I mean
probably<00:07:09.100> it<00:07:09.160> wasn't<00:07:09.310> until<00:07:09.610> I<00:07:09.670> actually<00:07:09.820> beat

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
probably it wasn't until I actually beat

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.220 
probably it wasn't until I actually beat
the<00:07:10.240> game<00:07:10.390> for<00:07:10.570> the<00:07:10.630> first<00:07:10.780> time<00:07:10.930> that<00:07:11.200> I

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
the game for the first time that I

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.570 
the game for the first time that I
managed<00:07:11.500> to<00:07:11.560> find<00:07:11.770> out<00:07:11.950> there's<00:07:12.160> a<00:07:12.250> fourth

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
managed to find out there's a fourth

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.520 
managed to find out there's a fourth
circuit<00:07:13.090> which<00:07:13.570> is<00:07:13.600> actually<00:07:14.020> much<00:07:14.290> much

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
circuit which is actually much much

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.310 
circuit which is actually much much
harder<00:07:14.740> than<00:07:14.950> this<00:07:15.100> one<00:07:15.660> all<00:07:16.660> right<00:07:16.900> so<00:07:17.140> that's

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
harder than this one all right so that's

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.160 
harder than this one all right so that's
a<00:07:17.530> super<00:07:18.310> macho<00:07:18.610> man<00:07:18.940> down<00:07:19.150> and<00:07:19.360> that<00:07:19.930> sort<00:07:20.110> of

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.170 
a super macho man down and that sort of

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.870 
a super macho man down and that sort of
relatively<00:07:20.740> quick<00:07:21.040> run<00:07:21.340> through<00:07:21.370> the<00:07:21.670> world

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
relatively quick run through the world

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.610 
relatively quick run through the world
circuit<00:07:22.270> I'm<00:07:22.390> actually<00:07:22.810> kind<00:07:23.170> of<00:07:23.200> impressing

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 
circuit I'm actually kind of impressing

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.580 
circuit I'm actually kind of impressing
myself<00:07:24.270> so<00:07:25.270> let's<00:07:25.300> see<00:07:25.810> where<00:07:25.990> we<00:07:26.110> rank<00:07:26.350> I'm

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
myself so let's see where we rank I'm

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.750 
myself so let's see where we rank I'm
pretty<00:07:26.830> sure<00:07:26.950> that's<00:07:27.040> gonna<00:07:27.220> be<00:07:27.370> in<00:07:27.490> the<00:07:27.550> top

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
pretty sure that's gonna be in the top

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.870 
pretty sure that's gonna be in the top
three<00:07:28.090> for<00:07:28.120> mr.<00:07:28.570> macho<00:07:28.930> man<00:07:29.610> number<00:07:30.610> one

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 
three for mr. macho man number one

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.720 
three for mr. macho man number one
that's<00:07:31.120> that's<00:07:31.420> good<00:07:31.600> too<00:07:31.780> and<00:07:32.550> number<00:07:33.550> one

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:33.730 
that's that's good too and number one

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.940 
that's that's good too and number one
overall<00:07:34.150> sorry<00:07:34.930> sand<00:07:35.290> up<00:07:36.000> so<00:07:37.320> that<00:07:38.320> is<00:07:38.590> the<00:07:38.800> end

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950 
overall sorry sand up so that is the end

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.560 
overall sorry sand up so that is the end
of<00:07:39.040> the<00:07:39.130> world<00:07:39.340> circuit<00:07:39.760> another<00:07:39.940> four<00:07:40.270> wins

of the world circuit another four wins

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.520 
of the world circuit another four wins
and<00:07:41.280> two<00:07:42.280> knockouts<00:07:42.790> I<00:07:42.940> believe<00:07:43.240> so<00:07:43.990> no<00:07:44.350> not

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
and two knockouts I believe so no not

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.370 
and two knockouts I believe so no not
yet<00:07:44.710> sorry<00:07:44.980> and<00:07:45.280> yeah<00:07:46.030> so<00:07:46.450> I<00:07:46.480> will<00:07:46.780> see<00:07:46.960> you<00:07:47.110> in
