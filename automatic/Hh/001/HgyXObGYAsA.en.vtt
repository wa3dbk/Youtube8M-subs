fourth<00:00:19.890> preseason<00:00:20.490> game<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.720> pretty

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989 
fourth preseason game is pretty

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.439 
fourth preseason game is pretty
meaningless<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:23.340> college<00:00:23.849> football<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
meaningless in college football that

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.870 
meaningless in college football that
fourth<00:00:24.840> non-conference<00:00:25.829> game<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.700> be<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
fourth non-conference game can be a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
fourth non-conference game can be a
precursor<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.630> things<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.529> come<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.980> league

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
precursor of things to come in league

precursor of things to come in league
play<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.879> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.149> it's<00:00:30.509> no<00:00:30.719> exception<00:00:31.200> with

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
play and I think it's no exception with

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
play and I think it's no exception with
Wisconsin<00:00:31.950> maybe<00:00:32.309> especially<00:00:32.730> with

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
Wisconsin maybe especially with

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.369 
Wisconsin maybe especially with
Wisconsin<00:00:33.750> although<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.079> could<00:00:34.200> probably

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
Wisconsin although you could probably

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.319 
Wisconsin although you could probably
say<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> about<00:00:34.860> any<00:00:35.129> number<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> teams<00:00:35.789> even<00:00:36.210> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
say it about any number of teams even in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
say it about any number of teams even in
the<00:00:36.420> big<00:00:36.600> town<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:36.989> maybe<00:00:37.140> especially<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the big town or maybe especially in the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Big Ten clearly this is a team I keep

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.569 
Big Ten clearly this is a team I keep
thinking<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.890> words<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> Bret

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thinking of the two words that Bret

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
thinking of the two words that Bret
Bielema<00:00:41.730> used<00:00:42.239> last<00:00:42.570> week<00:00:42.929> at<00:00:43.109> a<00:00:43.140> news

Bielema used last week at a news
conference<00:00:43.559> baby<00:00:44.159> steps<00:00:44.609> maybe<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.179> saw<00:00:45.420> some

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
conference baby steps maybe we saw some

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.069 
conference baby steps maybe we saw some
of<00:00:45.839> that<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.199> offense<00:00:47.030> last<00:00:48.030> week<00:00:48.420> still

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of that with the offense last week still

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.220 
of that with the offense last week still
nowhere<00:00:49.379> near<00:00:49.829> where<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> wants<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.609> but

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
nowhere near where it wants to be but

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
nowhere near where it wants to be but
Monta<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.409> able<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> big<00:00:53.159> crease<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.609> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
Monta is able to get a big crease in the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.759 
Monta is able to get a big crease in the
long<00:00:53.850> touchdown<00:00:54.359> run<00:00:54.600> heavy<00:00:54.839> workload<00:00:55.499> and

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
long touchdown run heavy workload and

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.459 
long touchdown run heavy workload and
three<00:00:56.729> games<00:00:56.969> three<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:57.569> quarter<00:00:57.960> games<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
three games three four quarter games so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
three games three four quarter games so
at<00:00:58.620> least<00:00:58.769> they're<00:00:59.039> used<00:00:59.249> to<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.609> figuring

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
at least they're used to it now figuring

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.340 
at least they're used to it now figuring
there's<00:01:00.329> probably<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.170> where

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
there's probably going to be more where

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
there's probably going to be more where
that<00:01:01.379> came<00:01:01.710> from<00:01:01.769> as<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.249> move<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.519> a<00:01:02.609> league

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that came from as they move in a league

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
that came from as they move in a league
placing<00:01:03.269> I<00:01:03.479> think<00:01:03.749> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.929> looked<00:01:04.260> at

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
placing I think if you just looked at

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
placing I think if you just looked at
that<00:01:04.530> box<00:01:04.739> score<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> Utah<00:01:06.120> State<00:01:06.180> game

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that box score from the Utah State game

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.750 
that box score from the Utah State game
and<00:01:06.840> looked<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> offensive<00:01:07.799> statistics

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and looked at the offensive statistics

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.630 
and looked at the offensive statistics
you<00:01:09.330> want<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> felt<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you want to felt the same way about the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
you want to felt the same way about the
offense<00:01:12.000> making<00:01:12.240> strides<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> watch

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
offense making strides but if you watch

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
offense making strides but if you watch
the<00:01:13.920> game<00:01:14.160> there<00:01:14.670> were<00:01:14.760> tailbacks<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the game there were tailbacks at the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
the game there were tailbacks at the
second<00:01:15.930> level<00:01:16.340> numerous<00:01:17.340> times<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.910> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
second level numerous times and we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.310 
second level numerous times and we
hadn't<00:01:18.330> seen<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.510> through<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> first<00:01:19.140> two

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
hadn't seen that through the first two

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
hadn't seen that through the first two
games<00:01:19.350> yeah<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.040> part<00:01:20.370> of<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.550> that

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
games yeah and that's part of that that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.040 
games yeah and that's part of that that
whole<00:01:20.940> thing<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.300> about<00:01:21.510> with<00:01:21.780> brett's

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
whole thing was about with brett's

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.540 
whole thing was about with brett's
talking<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> baby<00:01:23.100> steps

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
talking about with the baby steps

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.060 
talking about with the baby steps
clearly<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.240> consistency<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> lacking<00:01:25.650> you'd

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
clearly the consistency is lacking you'd

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
clearly the consistency is lacking you'd
see<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.460> eight-yard<00:01:26.880> gain<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.360> first<00:01:27.660> down<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
see an eight-yard gain on first down and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
see an eight-yard gain on first down and
second<00:01:28.890> third<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.340> couldn't<00:01:29.670> pick<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:30.000> those

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
second third they couldn't pick up those

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.320 
second third they couldn't pick up those
lines<00:01:30.420> yardage<00:01:31.410> Tommy<00:01:31.830> yeah<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.910> tough<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
lines yardage Tommy yeah it's tough and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.060 
lines yardage Tommy yeah it's tough and
it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> offensive<00:01:34.620> line<00:01:34.650> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it's not just the offensive line you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.250 
it's not just the offensive line you
need<00:01:35.190> everybody<00:01:35.700> else<00:01:35.970> blocking<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.930> well

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
need everybody else blocking as well

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
but he came in and he managed the game a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.610 
but he came in and he managed the game a
lot<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.329> quarterbacks<00:03:32.570> don't<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.230> but

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
lot of quarterbacks don't like that but

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.310 
lot of quarterbacks don't like that but
those<00:03:34.040> two<00:03:34.310> words<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> game<00:03:35.269> manager<00:03:35.600> but

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
those two words be a game manager but

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.479 
those two words be a game manager but
that's<00:03:36.530> where<00:03:36.709> they<00:03:36.799> are<00:03:36.920> right<00:03:37.130> now<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.400> I

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that's where they are right now and I

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.560 
that's where they are right now and I
thought<00:03:37.610> Joel<00:03:37.880> did<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.090> pretty<00:03:38.209> good<00:03:38.329> job<00:03:38.390> of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
thought Joel did a pretty good job of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.210 
thought Joel did a pretty good job of
that<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.989> bottom<00:03:39.260> line<00:03:39.440> with<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.650> offense

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that and the bottom line with a offense

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.920 
that and the bottom line with a offense
scuffling<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.180> been<00:03:41.329> very<00:03:41.360> very

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
scuffling and it's been very very

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.960 
scuffling and it's been very very
inconsistent<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:43.400> hasn't<00:03:43.549> been<00:03:43.730> real

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
inconsistent and there hasn't been real

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.850 
inconsistent and there hasn't been real
a<00:03:44.000> strong<00:03:44.540> semblance<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.260> running<00:03:45.500> game<00:03:45.620> so

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
a strong semblance of a running game so

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.830 
a strong semblance of a running game so
if<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.040> can't<00:03:46.250> turn<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.610> over<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:47.329> cannot<00:03:47.660> put

if you can't turn it over you cannot put

up scoring those turnovers have hurt

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.520 
up scoring those turnovers have hurt
especially<00:03:53.510> at<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.079> quarterback<00:03:54.380> position

now conversely the Badgers have to find
a<00:03:57.350> way<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:57.680> sounds<00:03:57.829> like<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.070> broken<00:03:58.310> record

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
a way this sounds like a broken record

a way this sounds like a broken record

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
find a way to get the ball back they'd

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.690 
find a way to get the ball back they'd
no<00:04:01.409> question<00:04:01.829> about<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.129> now<00:04:02.400> they<00:04:02.519> got<00:04:02.670> a

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
no question about it now they got a

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.789 
no question about it now they got a
spark<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.180> Ken<00:04:03.510> zeldo<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.170> punt<00:04:04.409> return

spark with Ken zeldo on the punt return

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.220

but<00:04:05.069> it's<00:04:05.760> loose<00:04:06.120> comparison<00:04:06.810> here<00:04:06.959> but<00:04:07.109> with

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
but it's loose comparison here but with

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.720 
but it's loose comparison here but with
baseball<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.799> get<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> broken<00:04:08.310> bat<00:04:08.459> single

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
baseball you get a broken bat single

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.130 
baseball you get a broken bat single
maybe<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.269> gets<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.599> out<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.900> slump

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
maybe that gets you out of the slump

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.140 
maybe that gets you out of the slump
maybe<00:04:10.739> here<00:04:11.040> defensively<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.879> can<00:04:12.000> get<00:04:12.120> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
maybe here defensively if you can get a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.360 
maybe here defensively if you can get a
turnover<00:04:12.450> get<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.439> offense<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.099> short

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
turnover get the offense in a short

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.890 
turnover get the offense in a short
field<00:04:14.640> not<00:04:15.120> only<00:04:15.299> does<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.569> help<00:04:15.750> the

field not only does it help the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.509 
field not only does it help the
defense's<00:04:16.500> confidence<00:04:16.979> knowing<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.400> can

defense's confidence knowing that it can
turn<00:04:17.699> people<00:04:17.910> over<00:04:18.389> but<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.900> offense<00:04:19.289> maybe

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
turn people over but the offense maybe

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.229 
turn people over but the offense maybe
doesn't<00:04:19.889> have<00:04:20.009> far<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.400> go<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.639> get<00:04:20.910> into<00:04:21.120> the
