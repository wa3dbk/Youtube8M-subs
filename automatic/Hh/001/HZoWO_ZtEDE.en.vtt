00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.570
 so we launched a new tradition 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.410
 three years ago in besanÃ§on to say 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.130
 Happy New Year everyone 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.539
 with a little music at a time for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 people who know the music well 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 and people who know her less 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.760
 well there is no need to be 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 especially connoisseur to appreciate 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.809
 that but connoisseurs will appreciate 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.809
 also something else and in another way 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.770
 we are here because we really believe in 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.870
 what we do we all came here to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 we are fighting because we believe in this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.530
 music we take sharing it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.870
 with people and after we will find 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.080
 in the audience of people who are going over 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.520
 far appreciate the works themselves 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.840
 but all will come out having 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.350
 the impression we will have that we have 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350
 makes a gift 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.650
 the kitchen I think it's the pub the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.680
 most beautiful piece of music that we have 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.540
 never written it changes what 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.630
 I usually listen to that music 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.130
 singing at kalinka school 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.130
 it was good it made the atmosphere 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.789
 I am Ukrainian and for me it is 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.859
 pleasure to listen to the music of 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.420
 Stravinsky's Tchaikovsky I love it 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.539
 all this is why we are here 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.539
 today 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.500
 classical music is music 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.030
 which has been successful for a long time 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.590
 for that it's called classic come 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.990
 see our orchestra come see the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.390
 average age of people who play and 6 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.710
 are going to be surprised because we have 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.930
 very very young people in the orchestra 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.360
 there is no obligation to love but 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 we have an obligation to propose that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.490
 so that people can 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.490
 know that it exists 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 and
