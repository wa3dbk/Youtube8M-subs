 some grape clusters are present 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.990
 further here is a light structural paste 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.210
 easy she's just an ordinary simulator 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.970
 that is, it simulates the volume and the same time 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.980
 in its weight it does not weigh down 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.090
 especially your product is white but 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.190
 structural paste and tint

 paint over any color that you 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.290
 need further structural paste 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.050
 video memory input is the easiest 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.840
 structural paste which gives this 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.590
 beautiful such a volume and absolutely not 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.750
 surprised product following here here 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.570
 two gels are also presented

 the gel is shiny they have a glass effect gel and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.140
 very often used for glass 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 matt de 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.250
 beautiful glass glossy volume 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.970
 which at 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.869
 transparency as it mimics the glass 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.979

 glass effects 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.440
 next we see the structural paste 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 rough rough fast yet 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.090

 then we move on to ours just 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.480
 here the structural paste is the most common 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.770
 modeling 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.050
 that is absolutely indispensable in such 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.150
 here are the usual decoupage things limit

 imitation of various textures 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.310
 for example it can be achieved on

 create some interesting ones 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.850
 structural fantasies 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
 very easy to apply and they are here so 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.930
