one<00:00:29.550> has<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.789> slightly<00:00:30.179> longer<00:00:30.420> brain<00:00:30.810> case

most scientists believe that these are
two<00:00:33.840> separate<00:00:34.260> species<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.550> wasn't

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
two separate species and there wasn't

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
two separate species and there wasn't
much<00:00:36.000> interaction<00:00:36.329> between<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.160> now

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
much interaction between the two but now

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.940 
much interaction between the two but now
we<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.540> breeding<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.170> that

neanderthal the researchers extracted

neanderthal the researchers extracted
DNA<00:00:48.629> from<00:00:49.140> Neanderthal<00:00:49.739> fossils<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
DNA from Neanderthal fossils and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
DNA from Neanderthal fossils and
compared<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.510> taken<00:00:51.870> from<00:00:52.140> people

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
compared it with that taken from people

compared it with that taken from people
living<00:00:52.710> today<00:00:53.090> they<00:00:54.090> found<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> DNA<00:00:55.199> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
living today they found that the DNA of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.830 
living today they found that the DNA of
europeans<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.129> asians<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:57.270> percent

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
europeans and asians is two percent

europeans and asians is two percent
neanderthal<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.820> exciting

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
neanderthal it's a very exciting

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.330 
neanderthal it's a very exciting
discovery<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.050> gives<00:01:01.260> us<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
discovery because it gives us really the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
discovery because it gives us really the
first<00:01:02.550> strong<00:01:03.120> evidence<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> there<00:01:04.199> wasn't

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
first strong evidence that there wasn't

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.690 
first strong evidence that there wasn't
breeding<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.159> people<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
breeding with people like the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
breeding with people like the
Neanderthals<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.960> means<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.290> modern

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Neanderthals and it means that modern

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
Neanderthals and it means that modern
humans<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.280> different<00:01:08.640> parts<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> world

humans in different parts of the world

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.130 
humans in different parts of the world
may<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.780> slightly<00:01:10.470> different<00:01:10.650> mixes

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
may have slightly different mixes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
may have slightly different mixes
further<00:01:13.140> analysis<00:01:13.830> should<00:01:14.070> give<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> greater

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
further analysis should give a greater

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
further analysis should give a greater
insight<00:01:15.330> into<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.930> Neanderthals<00:01:16.680> lived<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
insight into how Neanderthals lived and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.679 
insight into how Neanderthals lived and
shed<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.390> light<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.689> our<00:01:19.170> own<00:01:19.439> early<00:01:20.070> origins
