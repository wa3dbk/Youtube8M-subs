00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
just on every single angle it was just a

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.909 
just on every single angle it was just a
colossal<00:03:33.129> disaster<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.049> think<00:03:35.349> you

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
colossal disaster and then you think you

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.490 
colossal disaster and then you think you
know<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.639> arts<00:03:36.970> types<00:03:37.239> get<00:03:37.599> rainbow<00:03:38.230> dragon

and some arch types get judgement dragon

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.920 
and some arch types get judgement dragon
and<00:03:41.799> it's<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.220> like<00:03:42.400> where's<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.389> equality

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.300 
traps should have been made for a deck
like<00:05:07.880> crystal<00:05:08.270> beasts<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.630> deck<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.140> by<00:05:09.950> a

that crystal bees play you know where

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.590 
that crystal bees play you know where
you<00:05:21.230> have<00:05:21.410> cards<00:05:21.830> like<00:05:22.100> abundance<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.360> you

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
trap zones to be filled thus you can't

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.210 
trap zones to be filled thus you can't
really<00:05:32.540> use<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:33.320> know<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> considerable

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
really use you know a considerable

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.190 
really use you know a considerable
amount<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.520> traps<00:05:34.790> and<00:05:35.120> that's<00:05:35.660> just<00:05:35.930> how<00:05:36.020> did

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
amount of traps and that's just how did

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.780 
amount of traps and that's just how did
that<00:05:36.290> worse<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:37.160> know<00:05:37.280> they<00:05:37.520> should<00:05:37.760> have

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
that worse you know they should have

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.610 
that worse you know they should have
made<00:05:38.060> hand<00:05:38.390> traps<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.780> were<00:05:38.930> specific<00:05:39.590> to

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
made hand traps that were specific to

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.260 
made hand traps that were specific to
crystal<00:05:40.130> beasts<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:40.280> know<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.580> see<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.090> as

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
crystal beasts you know I see that as

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.630 
crystal beasts you know I see that as
colossal<00:05:42.140> missed<00:05:42.320> opportunities<00:05:43.010> you<00:05:43.520> know

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
colossal missed opportunities you know

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.760 
colossal missed opportunities you know
what<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:43.790> mean<00:05:43.970> obviously<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.990> way<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.590> make

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
what I mean obviously the way to make

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.100 
what I mean obviously the way to make
amends<00:05:46.130> for<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.520> would<00:05:46.760> be<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:47.479> just<00:05:47.660> make<00:05:47.930> a

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
amends for this would be to just make a

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.870 
amends for this would be to just make a
few<00:05:48.140> broken<00:05:48.590> cards<00:05:49.040> like<00:05:49.130> I've<00:05:49.220> always<00:05:49.460> been

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
few broken cards like I've always been

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.000 
few broken cards like I've always been
just<00:05:50.090> hoping<00:05:50.450> and<00:05:50.600> dreaming<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:51.200> Konami

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
just hoping and dreaming that Konami

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.010 
just hoping and dreaming that Konami
would<00:05:52.250> just<00:05:52.430> for<00:05:52.970> some<00:05:53.210> reason<00:05:53.600> make<00:05:53.780> about

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
would just for some reason make about

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.890 
would just for some reason make about
four<00:05:54.830> or<00:05:55.280> five<00:05:55.669> now<00:05:56.180> maybe<00:05:56.390> not<00:05:56.570> even<00:05:56.690> that

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
four or five now maybe not even that

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.930 
four or five now maybe not even that
many<00:05:57.050> three<00:05:57.440> or<00:05:57.560> four<00:05:57.800> just<00:05:58.010> broken<00:05:58.580> crystal

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
many three or four just broken crystal

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.460 
many three or four just broken crystal
beast<00:05:59.090> cards<00:05:59.390> that<00:05:59.540> would<00:05:59.660> make<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.930> deck<00:06:00.080> cr1

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
beast cards that would make the deck cr1

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.520 
beast cards that would make the deck cr1
and<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:01.100> reason<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.490> say<00:06:01.669> this<00:06:01.700> is<00:06:02.140> not<00:06:03.140> just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
and the reason I say this is not just

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.800 
and the reason I say this is not just
you<00:06:03.800> know<00:06:03.919> even<00:06:04.280> going<00:06:04.970> past<00:06:05.210> everything<00:06:05.570> that

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
you know even going past everything that

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.140 
you know even going past everything that
I've<00:06:05.900> already<00:06:06.169> stated<00:06:06.680> you<00:06:07.400> know<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.760> info

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
I've already stated you know the info

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150 
I've already stated you know the info

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:55.409 
cards like maybe a hand trap that you

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.230

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 
know you could use that would be like

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.879 
know you could use that would be like
mirror<00:07:57.539> force<00:07:57.839> but<00:07:58.110> instead<00:07:58.379> of<00:07:58.529> sending<00:07:58.710> it

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:58.889 
mirror force but instead of sending it

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.200 
mirror force but instead of sending it
to<00:07:58.979> the<00:07:59.069> Graveyard<00:07:59.219> you<00:07:59.580> went<00:07:59.819> to<00:07:59.940> the<00:08:00.000> spell

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.210

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.760 
to the Graveyard you went to the spell
and<00:08:00.300> trap<00:08:00.389> zone<00:08:00.629> but<00:08:01.080> it<00:08:01.169> activated<00:08:01.650> in<00:08:01.710> the

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:01.770 
and trap zone but it activated in the

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.709 
and trap zone but it activated in the
hand<00:08:01.979> like<00:08:02.460> that<00:08:02.699> would<00:08:02.940> be<00:08:03.060> just<00:08:03.240> nasty<00:08:03.449> right

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:03.719 
hand like that would be just nasty right

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:05.899
