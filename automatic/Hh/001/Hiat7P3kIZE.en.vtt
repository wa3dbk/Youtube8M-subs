up<00:00:39.900> some<00:00:40.620> other<00:00:40.769> things<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> had<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.580> couple

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
up some other things so I had a couple

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.580 
up some other things so I had a couple
of<00:00:41.910> questions<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.420> came<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
of questions that came in about that so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.259 
of questions that came in about that so
figured<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.580> best<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.970> answer

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
figured out just the best way the answer

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.240 
figured out just the best way the answer
would<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.449> to<00:00:45.629> answer<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.199> a<00:00:46.230> video<00:00:46.470> or

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
would be to answer it with a video or

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
would be to answer it with a video or

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
what have you so the app that we're

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
what have you so the app that we're

using and that you used to run these
layers<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.920> load<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.309> MKS<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.059> on

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
layers and then load the MKS and all on

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.860 
layers and then load the MKS and all on

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
would go through to my library one which

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.380 
would go through to my library one which
is<00:02:51.500> my<00:02:51.620> general<00:02:51.920> MIDI<00:02:52.220> sounds<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.970> just

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
is my general MIDI sounds and just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.020 
is my general MIDI sounds and just
scroll<00:02:53.720> through<00:02:53.750> until<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.500> found<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.910> know

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
stranger's of stereo strains I think I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.650 
stranger's of stereo strains I think I
hit<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.970> mono<00:03:02.180> string<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.190> yeah<00:03:04.660> stereo

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
hit the mono string so yeah stereo

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:23.070 
hit the mono string so yeah stereo
strings<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.250> in<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.640> lair
