across this entire picture frame we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
would make those stencils as we take our

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.220 
would make those stencils as we take our

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
as best you can and then you do a real

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.149 
as best you can and then you do a real
quick<00:01:06.270> cut<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.159> scissors<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.920> didn't

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quick cut with the scissors that didn't

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.370 
quick cut with the scissors that didn't
work<00:01:11.250> quite<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:13.670> try<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> again

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
work quite that well try that again

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
work quite that well try that again
there<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> cleaner<00:01:17.100> cut<00:01:17.330> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there we go there's a cleaner cut and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.410 
there we go there's a cleaner cut and
you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> end<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.619> is

pinking<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.430> line<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.850> next

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

to<00:01:27.330> each<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> offset<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to each other and offset I'm just a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.960 
to each other and offset I'm just a
little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> zigzag<00:01:29.520> pattern<00:01:29.549> all

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
little bit you get a zigzag pattern all

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
little bit you get a zigzag pattern all
the<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.290> I've<00:01:31.380> done

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the way down and that's what I've done

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
the way down and that's what I've done
over<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.100> side<00:01:32.360> already<00:01:33.360> in

over here on this side already in

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
over here on this side already in
advance<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.229> project<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.009> going

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
advance the project and what I'm going

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
advance the project and what I'm going
to<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.759> them<00:01:35.909> an<00:01:36.000> alternate

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to do is just take them an alternate

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
to do is just take them an alternate
them<00:01:36.509> move<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> time<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.189> across<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
them move one at a time down across the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.090 
them move one at a time down across the
frame<00:01:38.850> until<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> alternating

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
frame until I get the alternating

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.140 
frame until I get the alternating
zig-zag<00:01:41.100> pattern<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> back

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
zig-zag pattern and then with the back

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
zig-zag pattern and then with the back
of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> stencil<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> each<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.290> I'll<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
of the stencil to each other I'll get a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.350 
of the stencil to each other I'll get a
nice<00:01:43.829> straight<00:01:44.159> line<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
nice straight line going to do the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
nice straight line going to do the
zigzags<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> Ruby<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> straight

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
lines and the gold leaf so we'll take

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.840 
lines and the gold leaf so we'll take
our<00:01:50.520> Ruby<00:01:50.850> rub<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.180> buff<00:01:52.399> we'll<00:01:53.399> shake<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> up

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
our Ruby rub and buff we'll shake it up

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
our Ruby rub and buff we'll shake it up
a<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:53.970> make<00:01:54.689> sure<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.960> nice<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.170> mixed<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
a bit make sure it's nice and mixed in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.320 
a bit make sure it's nice and mixed in
there<00:01:56.329> I'm<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> apply<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> right

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330

onto the frame right on to where we want
two<00:02:03.270> stents<00:02:03.510> with<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:03.920> put<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> good<00:02:05.100> amount

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
two stents with this put a good amount

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.940 
two stents with this put a good amount
there<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:07.260> I'm<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> make<00:02:07.680> sure<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.920> i

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
there and I'm going to make sure that i

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160 
there and I'm going to make sure that i
only<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.940> EDM<00:02:09.479> i<00:02:09.509> spawned<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.990> because

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
only use the EDM i spawned you because

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.480 
only use the EDM i spawned you because
if<00:02:10.290> i<00:02:10.350> do<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.070> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.340> too

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
if i do this then it's going to be too

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
if i do this then it's going to be too
wide<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> outside

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
wide and we're going to get it outside

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.560 
wide and we're going to get it outside
of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> stencil<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.940> cap<00:02:15.150> back<00:02:15.180> on

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
of the stencil so put the cap back on

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
of the stencil so put the cap back on
our<00:02:15.750> rub<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.080> buff<00:02:16.230> probably<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> little

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
our rub and buff probably need a little

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.130 
our rub and buff probably need a little
bit<00:02:17.190> more<00:02:17.370> later<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.060> we'll<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.840> start<00:02:18.990> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
bit more later and we'll just start to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
bit more later and we'll just start to
spread<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.940> nice<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> evenly<00:02:21.950> across<00:02:22.950> our

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
spread this nice and evenly across our

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
spread this nice and evenly across our
stencil<00:02:23.880> again<00:02:24.540> we're<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.040> make<00:02:26.040> sure

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
stencil again we're going to make sure

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.710 
stencil again we're going to make sure
we<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.580> outside<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:27.060> our<00:02:27.180> stencil<00:02:27.600> while

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
we don't go outside of our stencil while

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.410 
we don't go outside of our stencil while
we're<00:02:27.870> doing<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:30.120> we've<00:02:30.240> got<00:02:30.390> that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
we're doing this so we've got that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.140 
we're doing this so we've got that
spread<00:02:30.930> nice<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.170> evenly<00:02:31.590> across<00:02:31.770> there<00:02:32.220> now

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
spread nice and evenly across there now

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
spread nice and evenly across there now
we're<00:02:33.300> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> pull<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:35.010> side

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
we're going to pull up just the one side

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.300 
we're going to pull up just the one side
of<00:02:35.520> our<00:02:35.610> stencil<00:02:36.180> real<00:02:36.660> carefully<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
of our stencil real carefully here you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.800 
of our stencil real carefully here you
can<00:02:38.459> see<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.610> pinking<00:02:39.120> pattern<00:02:39.450> starting<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
can see that pinking pattern starting to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.390 
can see that pinking pattern starting to
show<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:39.990> looks<00:02:40.290> real<00:02:40.500> nice<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:44.250> we're<00:02:44.370> just

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
show up looks real nice then we're just

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.440 
show up looks real nice then we're just
going<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.880> our<00:02:45.060> stencil<00:02:46.400> lay<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.520> down<00:02:47.730> so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
going to take our stencil lay it down so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
going to take our stencil lay it down so
that<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:48.780> set<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.410> parallel<00:02:49.709> lines<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that we get set of parallel lines on the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.480 
that we get set of parallel lines on the
other<00:02:50.520> side<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:51.500> try<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.560> get<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.890> even

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
other side here try and get this even

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.330 
other side here try and get this even
all<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.670> way<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.090> down<00:02:54.180> here

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 

so<00:02:59.910> here<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.180> am<00:03:00.209> about<00:03:00.599> two<00:03:01.470> thirds<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> way

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so here I am about two thirds of the way

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.800 
so here I am about two thirds of the way
across<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.550> friend<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.629> I've<00:03:03.690> been

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
across my friend you can see I've been

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.449 
across my friend you can see I've been
alternating<00:03:04.140> between<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.830> Ruby<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
alternating between the Ruby with the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.759 
alternating between the Ruby with the
zigzag<00:03:05.879> pattern<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.319> gold<00:03:07.590> leaf

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
zigzag pattern and the the gold leaf

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.710 
zigzag pattern and the the gold leaf
with<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.129> straight<00:03:08.370> lines<00:03:08.610> there<00:03:08.879> I'm<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.540> one

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
with the straight lines there I'm on one

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.390 
with the straight lines there I'm on one
of<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> straight<00:03:10.110> lines<00:03:10.349> now<00:03:10.620> I'm<00:03:11.190> just<00:03:11.280> going

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
of the straight lines now I'm just going

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.930 
of the straight lines now I'm just going
to<00:03:11.550> take<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.790> little<00:03:11.970> bit<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.209> gold<00:03:12.480> leaf<00:03:13.819> put<00:03:14.819> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
to take a little bit of gold leaf put it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.809 
to take a little bit of gold leaf put it
directly<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.569> frame

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.970 

and<00:03:24.780> then<00:03:25.109> take<00:03:25.409> our<00:03:25.620> foam<00:03:26.370> brush<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.980> just

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
and then take our foam brush and just

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.709 
and then take our foam brush and just
brush<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.700> right<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.209> there<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:33.269> only<00:03:33.480> take

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
brush that right in there is only take

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.809 
brush that right in there is only take
me<00:03:33.930> about<00:03:33.959> 15<00:03:34.560> minutes<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.489> all<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.730> way

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
me about 15 minutes to get all the way

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.360 
me about 15 minutes to get all the way
across<00:03:35.939> the<00:03:36.299> frame<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.689> hear<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.010> real

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
across the frame to hear this is a real

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.520 
across the frame to hear this is a real
quick<00:03:38.670> easy<00:03:38.879> little<00:03:39.239> project<00:03:39.719> so<00:03:40.139> here<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.409> are

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
quick easy little project so here we are

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
quick easy little project so here we are
we're<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.799> put<00:03:40.889> our<00:03:40.950> last<00:03:41.250> red<00:03:41.549> zigzag

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
we're going to put our last red zigzag

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.860 
we're going to put our last red zigzag
down<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.540> end<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.109> this<00:03:44.450> little<00:03:45.450> bit<00:03:45.629> right

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
down the end of this little bit right

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.670 
down the end of this little bit right
along<00:03:46.439> here<00:03:47.540> again<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.689> is<00:03:48.750> Ruby<00:03:49.319> rubbing
