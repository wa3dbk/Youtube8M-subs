00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
soft even as I was washing it but for

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.850 
soft even as I was washing it but for
this<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.090> clearly<00:01:48.570> tell<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
this one I can clearly tell that you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
this one I can clearly tell that you
know<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> took<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.369> more<00:01:50.549> effort<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.060> wash

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
know I took a little more effort to wash

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.139 
know I took a little more effort to wash
it<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.540> hair<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.070> guess<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it in my hair and then it just I guess I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.080 
it in my hair and then it just I guess I
made<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.509> hair

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
made to my hair

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.310 
made to my hair
have<00:01:57.090> warm<00:01:57.299> residue<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> explain<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
have warm residue how can I explain it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
have warm residue how can I explain it
it's<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.640> build-up<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> shampoo

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it's like what build-up with the shampoo

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's like what build-up with the shampoo
you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> guess<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you know but this one I guess is a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.530 
you know but this one I guess is a
little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.820> clarifying<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.390> don't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
little bit more clarifying I don't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.520 
little bit more clarifying I don't
really<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.350> definitely

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
really know but this one definitely

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
really know but this one definitely
makes<00:02:05.040> me<00:02:05.130> hear<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.490> softer

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
makes me hear a lot softer

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
makes me hear a lot softer
I<00:02:06.240> could<00:02:06.719> definitely<00:02:06.780> run<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.290> fingers

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
I could definitely run my fingers

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.160 
I could definitely run my fingers
through<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.250> ends<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:08.610> hair

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
through the ends of my hair

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.380 
through the ends of my hair
and<00:02:09.259> yeah<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.490> definitely<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.240> one

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and yeah so I definitely think this one

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.330 
and yeah so I definitely think this one
works<00:02:11.540> better<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:11.840> me<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.740> think<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.160> also

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
works better for me and I think I also

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.300 
works better for me and I think I also
see<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.760> last<00:02:14.030> hair<00:02:14.930> fall<00:02:15.319> from<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.190> you

that<00:06:15.710> defy<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.070> is<00:06:16.280> that<00:06:16.460> sometimes<00:06:16.730> they<00:06:16.850> come

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
that defy it is that sometimes they come

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.510 
that defy it is that sometimes they come
in<00:06:17.150> like<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.300> huge<00:06:17.540> white<00:06:17.930> bottle<00:06:18.350> but<00:06:19.190> in<00:06:19.400> any

black

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
black

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.740 
black
cuz<00:06:22.670> that's<00:06:22.760> the<00:06:22.880> first<00:06:23.060> one<00:06:23.150> I<00:06:23.240> use<00:06:23.390> it<00:06:23.540> was<00:06:23.660> in

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
cuz that's the first one I use it was in

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.090 
cuz that's the first one I use it was in
a<00:06:23.810> white<00:06:23.930> bottle<00:06:24.290> but<00:06:24.560> you<00:06:24.710> know<00:06:24.800> everything

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
a white bottle but you know everything

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.260 
a white bottle but you know everything
was<00:06:25.190> still<00:06:25.310> the<00:06:25.400> same<00:06:25.580> you<00:06:25.820> know<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:25.940> bottle

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
was still the same you know the bottle

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.440 
was still the same you know the bottle
was<00:06:26.420> still<00:06:26.950> black<00:06:27.950> with<00:06:28.220> like<00:06:28.310> old<00:06:28.669> letters

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
was still black with like old letters

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.150 
was still black with like old letters
and<00:06:29.479> stuff<00:06:29.720> like<00:06:29.840> that<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:30.320> that's<00:06:30.860> the<00:06:30.979> first

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
and stuff like that so that's the first

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.830 
and stuff like that so that's the first
one<00:06:31.280> to<00:06:31.370> use

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
one to use

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.790 
one to use
it<00:06:31.990> was<00:06:32.110> a<00:06:32.250> bigger<00:06:33.250> size<00:06:33.520> and<00:06:34.650> another<00:06:35.650> way<00:06:35.740> to

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
it was a bigger size and another way to

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.160 
it was a bigger size and another way to
identify<00:06:35.860> it<00:06:36.250> is<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.850> I<00:06:37.120> think<00:06:37.180> this<00:06:37.810> one<00:06:37.990> for

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
identify it is that I think this one for

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.100 
identify it is that I think this one for
some<00:06:38.290> reason<00:06:38.320> lighter<00:06:38.860> color<00:06:39.930> this<00:06:40.930> looks

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
some reason lighter color this looks

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.710 
some reason lighter color this looks
like<00:06:41.169> a<00:06:41.230> bit<00:06:41.889> of<00:06:42.010> a<00:06:42.070> golden<00:06:42.550> color<00:06:42.790> almost<00:06:43.300> like
