you can see the head of the bolt is sunk
in<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.960> into<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> hole<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.670> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
in right into the hole what I'm going to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.759 
in right into the hole what I'm going to
do<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.210> remove<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.869> bolt<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.380> actually

do now is remove this bolt it's actually

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.339 
do now is remove this bolt it's actually
not<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> true<00:00:26.519> share<00:00:26.849> pin<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.689> regular<00:00:28.080> bolt

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
not a true share pin it's a regular bolt

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.810 
not a true share pin it's a regular bolt
and<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.710> bad<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.670> hit

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and that's bad because if you hit

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
and that's bad because if you hit
something<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.660> may<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.050> break<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> can

a bit so basically you want the bolt to
be<00:01:42.630> loose<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.290> approximately<00:01:43.979> 1/16<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
be loose like this approximately 1/16 to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.780 
be loose like this approximately 1/16 to
1/8<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:45.840> inch<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.799> lock<00:01:47.100> nut<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.579> the

1/8 of an inch it is a lock nut at the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
1/8 of an inch it is a lock nut at the
end<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> bolt<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
end of the bolt so it's not going to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
end of the bolt so it's not going to
come<00:01:49.439> off<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.430> having<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> bolt<00:01:51.240> loose

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
come off and by having the bolt loose

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.090 
come off and by having the bolt loose
like<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.140> taking<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> pressure<00:01:52.920> off

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
like this it's taking the pressure off

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
like this it's taking the pressure off
the<00:01:53.460> shaft<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.970> putting<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> shear

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the shaft and putting it on to the shear

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.319 
the shaft and putting it on to the shear
pin<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.159> augurs<00:01:56.520> therefore<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
pin and the augurs therefore if you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
pin and the augurs therefore if you
should<00:01:57.600> hit<00:01:57.780> something<00:01:58.200> by<00:01:58.380> accident<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
should hit something by accident the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.069 
should hit something by accident the
share<00:01:59.520> pin<00:01:59.759> will<00:01:59.939> break<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.689> will<00:02:00.840> not

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
share pin will break and you will not

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.310 
share pin will break and you will not
cause<00:02:01.350> damage<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.829> your<00:02:02.159> gearbox<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> that's
