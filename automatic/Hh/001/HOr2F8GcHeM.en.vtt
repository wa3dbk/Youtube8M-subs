00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
i actually feel that my one is hell of a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
i actually feel that my one is hell of a
lot<00:01:00.390> worse<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.870> avoid<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.710> think

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
lot worse and avoid it's one I think

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.050 
lot worse and avoid it's one I think
avoided<00:01:02.640> ones<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> funny<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:05.060> ibas

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
avoided ones is funny because ibas

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.030 
avoided ones is funny because ibas
lulled<00:01:06.330> into<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> false<00:01:06.810> sense<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.470> security<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
lulled into a false sense of security in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.420 
lulled into a false sense of security in
it<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.970> quite<00:01:09.240> early<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> game

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
it or it will be quite early in the game

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
it or it will be quite early in the game
but<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.330> absolutely<00:01:12.810> die

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
but my one is just absolutely die

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.230 
but my one is just absolutely die
because<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> what<00:01:14.250> happens<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.670> panic

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
because it's what happens when panic

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
because it's what happens when panic
sets<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> situation
