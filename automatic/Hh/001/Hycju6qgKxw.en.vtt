00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.520 
I thought was cool was the web cape on
his<00:01:46.290> back<00:01:47.000> actually<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.509> glued<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> his<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
his back actually is glued to his back I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.660 
his back actually is glued to his back I
thought<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.860> something<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.430> like

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thought was something that was just like

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
thought was something that was just like
throwing<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.020> could<00:01:52.320> fall<00:01:52.590> off

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
throwing on there that could fall off

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.499 
throwing on there that could fall off
you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.430> wasn't<00:01:53.729> attached<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.240> way

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you know that wasn't attached in any way

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
you know that wasn't attached in any way
shape<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.869> form<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:55.979> fly<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.460> are

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
shape or form but I'm fly that they are

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.810 
shape or form but I'm fly that they are
they<00:01:56.820> didn't<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.210> may<00:01:57.450> just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
they didn't do that may just

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.030 
they didn't do that may just
Peppa<00:01:59.810> Pig<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.140> him<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:02.710> thought<00:02:03.710> was<00:02:03.890> going<00:02:03.979> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
Peppa Pig on him I thought was going to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.100 
Peppa Pig on him I thought was going to
be<00:02:04.100> like<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.550> know<00:02:04.610> one<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.570> those<00:02:05.690> fears<00:02:05.990> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
be like you know one of those fears to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.109 
be like you know one of those fears to
the<00:02:06.170> fiercest<00:02:06.830> phone<00:02:07.010> spider-man<00:02:07.490> figures

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the fiercest phone spider-man figures

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.120 
the fiercest phone spider-man figures
kind<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.990> thing<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:09.440> with<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.770> we're

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
kind of thing going on with it we're

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
uh yeah they actually did really good on

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.020 
uh yeah they actually did really good on
this<00:02:37.250> one<00:02:37.310> his<00:02:38.270> articulation<00:02:38.600> his<00:02:39.100> head<00:02:40.100> can

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
this one his articulation his head can

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.380 
this one his articulation his head can
go<00:02:41.360> up<00:02:41.540> just<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.620> know<00:02:42.739> only<00:02:43.130> they're<00:02:43.430> not<00:02:43.640> any

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
go up just you know only they're not any

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.020 
go up just you know only they're not any
higher<00:02:44.570> than<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:46.100> out<00:02:46.280> full<00:02:46.459> rotation

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
higher than that this out full rotation

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.630 
higher than that this out full rotation
of<00:02:47.150> course<00:02:48.340> arms<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.580> go<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
of course arms can go in and out and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.640 
of course arms can go in and out and
doing<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> full<00:02:52.880> rotation<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:54.080> don't<00:02:54.260> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
doing a full rotation just don't you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.400 
doing a full rotation just don't you
know<00:02:54.850> can't<00:02:55.850> get<00:02:56.000> too<00:02:56.180> much<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.170> mean

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
know can't get too much you know I mean

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.770 
know can't get too much you know I mean
unless<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.190> pull<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.489> arm<00:02:58.670> out<00:02:58.850> then<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.600> get

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
unless you pull the arm out then you get

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500 
unless you pull the arm out then you get
full<00:02:59.900> rotation<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:01.010> most<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.850> time<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
full rotation but most of the time the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.400 
full rotation but most of the time the
web<00:03:03.110> will<00:03:03.290> get<00:03:03.410> him<00:03:03.500> away<00:03:04.959> he<00:03:05.959> does<00:03:06.170> actually

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
web will get him away he does actually

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.440 
web will get him away he does actually
have<00:03:06.650> over<00:03:06.890> our<00:03:06.980> articulation<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.970> rotate<00:03:08.330> at

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
have over our articulation you rotate at

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.699 
have over our articulation you rotate at
the<00:03:08.480> upper<00:03:08.630> AB<00:03:10.630> legs<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.870> course<00:03:12.019> forward<00:03:12.560> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
the upper AB legs of course forward and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.509 
the upper AB legs of course forward and
back<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.970> out<00:03:14.410> two<00:03:15.410> joints<00:03:15.739> than<00:03:15.950> me<00:03:18.519> given

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
back and it out two joints than me given

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.420 
back and it out two joints than me given
of<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.700> feet<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.329> rotation<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:22.160> then<00:03:22.280> they

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
of the feet and rotation and then they

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.920 
of the feet and rotation and then they
fix<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.880> dreaded<00:03:23.150> stupid<00:03:23.870> ass<00:03:24.579> GIMP<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.730> leg

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
fix the dreaded stupid ass GIMP the leg

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.319
