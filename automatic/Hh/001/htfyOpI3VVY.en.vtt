00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
grade times about half the elevation and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.600 
grade times about half the elevation and
half<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.810> distance<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.650> really<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.890> kind

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
half the distance so it's really a kind

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.970 
half the distance so it's really a kind

of a warm up to Mount Washington

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:27.800 
of a warm up to Mount Washington
there<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.070> go<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:26.310> were<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.550> pretty<00:02:26.730> fast<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
there we go we were not pretty fast and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.210 
there we go we were not pretty fast and
there<00:02:28.140> were<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.350> three<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.860> us<00:02:28.980> running

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
there were like three of us running

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.780 
there were like three of us running
together<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.890> myself<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.700> another

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
together and then to myself and another

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.490 
together and then to myself and another
guy<00:02:33.000> broke<00:02:33.270> away<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.870> went<00:02:34.020> through<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.260> first

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
guy broke away we went through the first

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.460 
guy broke away we went through the first
mile<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.100> 7-10<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> thought<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.080> was<00:02:37.290> kind

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
mile in 7-10 so I thought that was kind

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.870 
mile in 7-10 so I thought that was kind
of<00:02:37.500> fast<00:02:37.740> because<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.100> record<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.730> this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
of fast because the record on this

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
of fast because the record on this
course<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.600> held<00:02:39.930> by<00:02:40.110> someone<00:02:40.170> who's<00:02:40.650> won

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.309 
yes so it's almost a ten thousand eight
hundred<00:05:37.530> foot<00:05:37.919> climb<00:05:38.190> out<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.460> nowhere<00:05:38.879> and<00:05:39.569> I

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
hundred foot climb out of nowhere and I

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.050 
hundred foot climb out of nowhere and I
think<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.919> only<00:05:40.949> other<00:05:41.250> mountain<00:05:41.610> bigger<00:05:41.849> in

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.879 
think the only other mountain bigger in
the<00:05:42.120> United<00:05:42.509> States<00:05:42.539> is<00:05:42.960> telescope<00:05:43.500> peak<00:05:43.710> in

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
the United States is telescope peak in

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.890 
the United States is telescope peak in
Death<00:05:44.039> Valley<00:05:44.090> which<00:05:45.090> goes<00:05:45.270> from<00:05:45.300> below<00:05:45.720> sea

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
Death Valley which goes from below sea

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.830 
Death Valley which goes from below sea
level<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.740> over<00:05:46.919> 11,000<00:05:47.580> feet<00:05:47.699> so<00:05:48.539> this<00:05:48.690> is<00:05:48.750> a

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
level to over 11,000 feet so this is a

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.040 
level to over 11,000 feet so this is a
monster<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:49.819> yet<00:05:50.819> snows<00:05:51.210> up<00:05:51.419> there<00:05:51.569> a<00:05:51.599> lot<00:05:51.840> you

about<00:06:03.719> 15<00:06:04.349> to<00:06:04.530> 20<00:06:04.650> feet<00:06:04.949> of<00:06:05.069> snow<00:06:05.250> up<00:06:05.280> at<00:06:05.669> the

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
about 15 to 20 feet of snow up at the

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.320 
about 15 to 20 feet of snow up at the
