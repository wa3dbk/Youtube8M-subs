00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 sarney can do this he needed to do next 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 I assume here 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.660
 such an initial idea 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.349
 stronger 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 basically 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.959
 of course it benefits you now 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.959

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.360
 It only benefits the whole world.
