00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:02.270 
hello everyone today I have an unboxing

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.960 
hello everyone today I have an unboxing
and<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.810> quick<00:00:04.200> initial<00:00:04.740> thoughts<00:00:05.009> on<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
and a quick initial thoughts on the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.750 
and a quick initial thoughts on the
Gryphon<00:00:06.690> protector<00:00:07.440> series<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.280> one

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
Gryphon protector series this is one

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200 
Gryphon protector series this is one
level<00:00:09.559> under<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.800> survivor<00:00:11.340> series<00:00:11.790> case

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
level under the survivor series case

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.369 
level under the survivor series case
which<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.900> using<00:00:13.650> as<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> daily<00:00:14.070> driver<00:00:14.250> for

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
which I was using as a daily driver for

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.580 
which I was using as a daily driver for
about<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:17.390> half<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.600> year<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> guess

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
about a half a year I guess

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980 
about a half a year I guess
but<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> felt<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.880> was<00:00:21.090> too<00:00:21.390> much<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
but I felt like this was too much and I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.189 
but I felt like this was too much and I
needed<00:00:22.380> something<00:00:22.769> slimmer<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> changed<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
needed something slimmer so I changed to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.660 
needed something slimmer so I changed to
a<00:00:25.430> Belkin<00:00:26.430> case<00:00:26.730> which<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:28.340> $12<00:00:29.340> for

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
a Belkin case which was about $12 for

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
a Belkin case which was about $12 for
two<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.080> cheap<00:00:31.410> case<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
two so it was a really cheap case and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.410 
two so it was a really cheap case and
this<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.850> subjected<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:34.010> custom<00:00:35.010> case

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
this was subjected to my custom case

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.860 
this was subjected to my custom case
thing<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:38.070> already<00:00:38.550> ruined<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.570> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
thing and it's already ruined so I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.130 
thing and it's already ruined so I
decided<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.399> more<00:00:41.820> higher<00:00:42.239> quality

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
decided to get a more higher quality

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
decided to get a more higher quality
case<00:00:43.469> than<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.160> Belkin<00:00:44.760> case<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> went

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
case than this Belkin case so I went

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
case than this Belkin case so I went
ahead<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> bought<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> protector<00:00:47.879> case<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
ahead and bought the protector case so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
ahead and bought the protector case so
this<00:00:49.050> comes<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> many<00:00:49.710> colors<00:00:50.190> I'll<00:00:50.399> post<00:00:50.789> all

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this comes in many colors I'll post all

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
this comes in many colors I'll post all
the<00:00:51.360> colors<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the colors like right here and this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
the colors like right here and this
retails<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.539> $29.99<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.520> pretty

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
retails for $29.99 which is pretty

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.349 
retails for $29.99 which is pretty
competitive<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.430> let's<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.640> slice<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
competitive and let's just slice this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.620 
competitive and let's just slice this
open<00:01:01.760> like<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:04.760> let's<00:01:05.760> take<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.570> out

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
open like that and let's take that out

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.490 
open like that and let's take that out
and<00:01:07.790> take<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:10.790> back<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.840> let's<00:01:15.840> slide<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and take that back and let's slide this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
and take that back and let's slide this
out<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.970> nothing<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> box<00:01:18.750> if

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
out and we have nothing in the box if

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.520 
out and we have nothing in the box if
you<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.590> wondering<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.990> there<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.229> some

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you are wondering and there are some

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:41.040 
you are wondering and there are some
tapes

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.460 

so<00:01:42.050> there<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.620> have<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.860> finally<00:01:43.580> there<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.210> a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
so there we have it finally there is a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.180 
so there we have it finally there is a
small<00:01:46.750> instruction<00:01:47.750> manual<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.590> get<00:01:49.040> I'm

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
small instruction manual I get I'm

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.050 
small instruction manual I get I'm
guessing<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.140> warranty<00:01:51.920> yeah<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:52.910> a

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
guessing it's a warranty yeah it's a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.440 
guessing it's a warranty yeah it's a
warranty<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.400> here<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.880> case<00:01:56.180> itself

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
warranty and here is the case itself

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.060 
warranty and here is the case itself
it's<00:01:59.450> just<00:02:00.670> there<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.910> go<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.500> went<00:02:03.800> with

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
it's just there we go and I went with

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.359 
it's just there we go and I went with
the<00:02:04.310> black<00:02:04.640> version<00:02:05.539> due<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.080> my<00:02:06.350> iPod<00:02:07.039> being

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
the black version due to my iPod being

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.430 
the black version due to my iPod being
read<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.179> doesn't<00:02:08.539> really<00:02:08.840> match<00:02:09.140> with

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
read and it doesn't really match with

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.400 
read and it doesn't really match with
the<00:02:09.500> blue<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.880> just<00:02:11.120> went<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.570> black<00:02:12.050> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the blue so I just went with black and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.860 
the blue so I just went with black and
it<00:02:12.500> was<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.820> could<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.360> pick<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.630> up

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it was there so I could just pick it up

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.170 
it was there so I could just pick it up
um<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.770> my<00:02:16.570> local<00:02:17.570> Future<00:02:18.170> Shop<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.520> my<00:02:19.730> initial

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
um in my local Future Shop so my initial

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.850 
um in my local Future Shop so my initial
thoughts<00:02:20.420> about<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.560> rugged

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
thoughts about this is really rugged

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.350 
thoughts about this is really rugged
compared<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.200> very<00:02:24.200> flimsy<00:02:25.090> Belkin<00:02:26.090> case

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
compared to this very flimsy Belkin case

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.620 
compared to this very flimsy Belkin case
this<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:27.260> really<00:02:27.560> rugged<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:29.330> does

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
this is really really rugged and it does

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.560 
this is really really rugged and it does
advertise<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.860> box<00:02:31.370> as<00:02:33.580> silicone<00:02:34.580> skin<00:02:35.180> it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
advertise on the box as silicone skin it

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.560 
advertise on the box as silicone skin it
says<00:02:36.880> absorb<00:02:38.530> jolts<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.650> bumps<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.330> says

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
says absorb jolts and bumps and it says

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.560 
says absorb jolts and bumps and it says
I<00:02:41.810> think<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.320> says<00:02:42.980> extra<00:02:43.640> thick<00:02:44.030> silicone

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
I think it says extra thick silicone

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.400 
I think it says extra thick silicone
right<00:02:44.780> here<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.850> does<00:02:47.209> advertise<00:02:47.930> extra

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
right here so it does advertise extra

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.190 
right here so it does advertise extra
thick<00:02:48.650> silicon<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.030> does<00:02:50.299> come<00:02:50.750> with<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
thick silicon and it does come with that

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.660 
thick silicon and it does come with that
extra<00:02:52.000> bulk<00:02:53.000> as<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.750> said<00:02:54.110> coz<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.250> almost

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
extra bulk as I said coz this is almost

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.910 
extra bulk as I said coz this is almost
as<00:02:55.880> twice<00:02:56.180> as<00:02:56.209> much<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.380> costs<00:02:57.799> this

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
as twice as much as this it costs this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.360 
as twice as much as this it costs this
twice<00:02:58.220> as<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.579> so<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.630> would<00:02:59.840> expect<00:03:00.709> some

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
twice as much so you would expect some

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.210 
twice as much so you would expect some
of<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.700> quality<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:03.500> seems<00:03:03.920> pretty

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
of the quality and this seems pretty

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.360 
of the quality and this seems pretty
hard<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.850> put<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:06.190> there's<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.489> box<00:03:08.239> on<00:03:09.370> so

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
hard to put on there's the box on so

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.090 
hard to put on there's the box on so
it's<00:03:10.579> less<00:03:10.940> flexible<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.079> it<00:03:12.200> makes<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.620> harder

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
it's less flexible so it makes it harder

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.470 
it's less flexible so it makes it harder
to<00:03:13.130> put<00:03:13.549> on<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.440> again<00:03:15.440> there<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:16.190> two<00:03:17.030> flops

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
to put on and again there are two flops

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.100 
to put on and again there are two flops
and<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.200> covers<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> whole<00:03:18.920> front<00:03:19.600> what<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.840> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
and it covers a whole front what on the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.930 
and it covers a whole front what on the
other<00:03:21.140> hand<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.829> one<00:03:22.160> only<00:03:22.370> covers<00:03:22.910> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
other hand this one only covers the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.140 
other hand this one only covers the
bottom<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.470> makes<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:25.040> harder<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.519> put<00:03:25.970> on

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
bottom so this makes it harder to put on

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.220 
bottom so this makes it harder to put on
but<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:27.110> more<00:03:27.350> durable<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:29.000> give<00:03:29.870> or

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
but it's more durable so it's give or

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.789 
but it's more durable so it's give or
take<00:03:30.820> there<00:03:31.820> we<00:03:32.060> go<00:03:32.239> we<00:03:32.450> have<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.079> cutout<00:03:33.440> for

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
take there we go we have the cutout for

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.360 
take there we go we have the cutout for
the<00:03:33.860> loop<00:03:34.549> which<00:03:34.910> no<00:03:35.329> one<00:03:35.540> uses<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.019> think

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
the loop which no one uses I think

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
the loop which no one uses I think
is<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:38.049> roomy<00:03:39.049> cutout<00:03:39.500> for<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.159> camera<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.180> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
is a roomy cutout for the camera and the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.649 
is a roomy cutout for the camera and the
flash<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:43.370> cutout<00:03:43.790> for<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.299> front-facing

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
flash and a cutout for the front-facing

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.640 
flash and a cutout for the front-facing
camera<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.650> all<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.700> your<00:03:46.940> buttons<00:03:47.409> seem<00:03:48.409> to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
camera and all of your buttons seem to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.880 
camera and all of your buttons seem to
be<00:03:48.769> covered<00:03:49.190> except<00:03:49.819> there's<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.629> big<00:03:51.049> flap<00:03:51.530> on

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
be covered except there's a big flap on

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.699 
be covered except there's a big flap on
the<00:03:52.640> bottom<00:03:53.120> which<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.629> wish<00:03:53.930> they<00:03:54.260> would<00:03:54.470> cover

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the bottom which I wish they would cover

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.930 
the bottom which I wish they would cover
with<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.310> silicone<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:57.950> one<00:03:58.250> right

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
with more silicone like this one right

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.940 
with more silicone like this one right
here<00:03:59.239> so<00:04:00.879> that's<00:04:01.879> a<00:04:02.299> little<00:04:02.510> bummer<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.379> guess

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
here so that's a little bummer I guess

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.190 
here so that's a little bummer I guess
and<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.970> buttons<00:04:05.360> are<00:04:05.569> really<00:04:05.959> really

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
and the buttons are really really

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.220 
and the buttons are really really
tactile<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.860> easy<00:04:07.129> to<00:04:07.400> press<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:08.629> like<00:04:08.959> the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
tactile and easy to press not like the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.819 
tactile and easy to press not like the

I<00:04:10.160> mean<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.180> OtterBox<00:04:11.780> case<00:04:12.260> which<00:04:13.099> my<00:04:13.609> mom

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
I mean the OtterBox case which my mom

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.330 
I mean the OtterBox case which my mom
has<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.480> it's<00:04:14.900> very<00:04:15.200> very<00:04:15.500> hard<00:04:15.709> but<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.130> is

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
has and it's very very hard but this is

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.400 
has and it's very very hard but this is
very<00:04:16.579> very<00:04:16.850> easy<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.299> press<00:04:17.660> all<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.380> buttons

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
very very easy to press all the buttons

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.819 
very very easy to press all the buttons
and<00:04:19.510> compared<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.870> it's<00:04:21.229> really<00:04:21.470> less

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
and compared to this it's really less

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.550 
and compared to this it's really less
bulky<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.490> no<00:04:23.270> one<00:04:23.419> really<00:04:23.720> needs<00:04:24.110> all<00:04:24.410> those

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
bulky like no one really needs all those

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.939 
bulky like no one really needs all those
protections<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.550> that's<00:04:26.410> 39.99<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:27.800> it's

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
protections so that's 39.99 so it's

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.300 
protections so that's 39.99 so it's
almost<00:04:28.220> double<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.389> would<00:04:29.930> really<00:04:30.410> if<00:04:30.740> you

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
almost double so I would really if you

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.340 
almost double so I would really if you
want<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.699> look<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.419> like<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.870> guess<00:04:33.169> this

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
want the look of this like I guess this

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.680 
want the look of this like I guess this
is<00:04:33.500> really<00:04:33.530> really<00:04:34.039> plain<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.820> if<00:04:35.360> you're

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
is really really plain so if you're

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.260 
is really really plain so if you're
going<00:04:35.900> for<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.229> looks<00:04:36.560> go<00:04:36.949> for<00:04:37.190> this<00:04:37.370> but<00:04:38.150> if

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
going for the looks go for this but if

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.480 
going for the looks go for this but if
you're<00:04:38.419> going<00:04:38.630> for<00:04:39.050> comfort<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.830> just

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
you're going for comfort and just

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.839 
you're going for comfort and just
stylish<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:42.229> just<00:04:42.530> go<00:04:42.680> with<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.400> I'll

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
stylish and just go with this and I'll

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.350 
stylish and just go with this and I'll
have<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.150> full<00:04:44.510> showdown<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.560> these<00:04:45.770> two<00:04:46.099> cases

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
have a full showdown of these two cases

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.440 
have a full showdown of these two cases
because<00:04:47.360> that's<00:04:47.630> what<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.289> think<00:04:48.740> most<00:04:49.039> people

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
because that's what I think most people

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.140 
because that's what I think most people
have<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.840> decide<00:04:50.990> upon<00:04:51.500> whether<00:04:52.310> get<00:04:52.639> this<00:04:52.880> or

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
have to decide upon whether get this or

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.810 
have to decide upon whether get this or
that<00:04:53.450> or<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.470> OtterBox<00:04:55.039> case<00:04:55.340> which<00:04:55.610> I'll

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
that or the OtterBox case which I'll

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.600 
that or the OtterBox case which I'll
have<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.060> showdown<00:04:56.539> with<00:04:56.599> this<00:04:56.990> but<00:04:57.979> thank<00:04:58.490> you

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
have a showdown with this but thank you

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.450 
have a showdown with this but thank you
