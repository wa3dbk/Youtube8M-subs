an<00:03:37.590> eye<00:03:37.650> out<00:03:37.680> for<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.280> took<00:03:38.430> me<00:03:38.550> till

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
an eye out for it and it took me till

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.880 
an eye out for it and it took me till
the<00:03:38.820> last<00:03:39.030> day<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.300> actually<00:03:39.870> see<00:03:40.709> them

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
the last day to actually see them

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.380 
the last day to actually see them
properly<00:03:41.370> wrapped<00:03:41.640> up<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.000> then<00:03:42.090> he<00:03:42.120> attacked

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
properly wrapped up and then he attacked

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.210 
properly wrapped up and then he attacked
Lord<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.989> them<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> last<00:03:43.500> day<00:03:43.769> because<00:03:44.010> that's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
Lord of them the last day because that's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.120 
Lord of them the last day because that's
always<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:45.330> case<00:03:45.450> doesn't<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.920> still

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
always the case doesn't it and I still

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.229 
always the case doesn't it and I still
think<00:03:47.310> it's<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:47.700> professional<00:03:48.090> because

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
think it's really professional because

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.509 
think it's really professional because
one<00:03:48.630> really<00:03:48.900> sad<00:03:49.050> worthless<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:50.100> was<00:03:50.280> from

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
one really sad worthless that was from

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.400 
one really sad worthless that was from
the<00:03:50.700> 20th<00:03:51.030> anniversary<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.900> they<00:03:52.170> sort<00:03:52.350> of

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the 20th anniversary so they sort of

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.840 
the 20th anniversary so they sort of
match<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.860> they're<00:03:52.950> different<00:03:53.130> Israel<00:03:53.670> so

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
match but they're different Israel so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.699 
match but they're different Israel so
that's<00:03:54.030> why<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.209> wanted<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.690> one<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.110> also

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that's why I wanted this one I also

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.930 
that's why I wanted this one I also
picked<00:03:55.860> up<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.070> separate<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.670> thought<00:03:56.820> it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
picked up a separate and I thought it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.210 
picked up a separate and I thought it
was<00:03:57.000> Navy<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.480> actually<00:03:57.810> black<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.410> but

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
was Navy of it's actually black and but

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.530 
was Navy of it's actually black and but

and I ended up not getting it and but it
was<00:04:18.450> really<00:04:18.600> really<00:04:18.840> pretty<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.520> quite

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
was really really pretty this is quite

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:21.750 
was really really pretty this is quite
plain<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.150> that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
plain so that

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.660 
plain so that
it<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:22.940> 49<00:04:23.450> 99<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:24.200> but<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.220> was<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.430> one<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
it was 49 99 and but it was the one that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.980 
it was 49 99 and but it was the one that
I<00:04:25.730> like<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:25.940> base<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.360> it's<00:04:26.480> okay<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.750> flock

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
I like the base and it's okay to flock

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.210 
I like the base and it's okay to flock
to<00:04:27.020> saying<00:04:27.350> that's<00:04:27.530> on<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.740> rather<00:04:27.860> than<00:04:28.070> like

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
to saying that's on it rather than like

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.820 
to saying that's on it rather than like
plastic<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:28.850> transversal<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:30.530> think<00:04:30.710> it's

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
plastic you transversal and I think it's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.260 
plastic you transversal and I think it's
