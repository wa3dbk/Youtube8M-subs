00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.150 
stick spin in remember in order to spin
it<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.840> need<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> keep<00:00:19.320> getting<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> from<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it you need to keep getting it from the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.450 
it you need to keep getting it from the
same<00:00:20.400> under<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> man<00:00:21.800> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> better<00:00:23.189> change

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
same under the man if you better change

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.660 
same under the man if you better change
direction<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> catch<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.400> from<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
direction you need to catch it from the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060 
direction you need to catch it from the
top<00:00:26.990> change<00:00:27.990> direction<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.650> being<00:00:28.890> the

and<00:00:43.680> spin<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> other<00:00:44.010> way

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.729 

like<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.690> add<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> throw<00:00:49.350> into

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
like that you can also add a throw into

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
like that you can also add a throw into
it<00:00:50.300> can<00:00:51.300> stick<00:00:51.629> spin<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.489> rahway<00:00:53.489> catch<00:00:54.030> from

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it can stick spin in rahway catch from

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.299 
it can stick spin in rahway catch from
the<00:00:54.360> dog<00:00:54.540> chain<00:00:54.870> direction<00:00:55.469> throw<00:00:55.769> it<00:00:55.980> from

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the dog chain direction throw it from

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:11.770 
the dog chain direction throw it from
the<00:00:56.519> top<00:00:56.730> change<00:00:57.449> direction

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.179 

once<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> hang<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.950> try

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
once you get the hang of it you can try

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.230 
once you get the hang of it you can try
switching<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> spin<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.049> helical<00:01:17.240> get

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
switching from a spin to a helical get

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.940 
switching from a spin to a helical get
the<00:01:18.390> spin<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.869> under<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:19.770> middle<00:01:21.950> catching

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the spin going under the middle catching

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
the spin going under the middle catching

then point in your hands take forward

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.259 
then point in your hands take forward
okay<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.500> copter<00:02:11.030> from<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
okay like that and the copter from the

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.940 
okay like that and the copter from the
top<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:12.959> point<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.410> your<00:02:13.530> hand<00:02:13.739> stick

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
top and then point in your hand stick

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.210 
top and then point in your hand stick
forward<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.989> practice<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.590> trick<00:02:16.860> by

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
forward you can practice this trick by

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.309 
forward you can practice this trick by
trying<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.849> as<00:02:18.060> many<00:02:18.329> spin<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.140> on

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
trying to do as many spin as you can on

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.150 
trying to do as many spin as you can on
one<00:02:19.500> steak<00:02:20.989> changing<00:02:21.989> as<00:02:22.200> much<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> can

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
one steak changing as much as you can

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.250 
one steak changing as much as you can
between<00:02:23.400> different<00:02:24.000> tricks<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.540> don't

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
between different tricks and don't

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.620 
between different tricks and don't
forget<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.620> try<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:26.340> hand<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:26.730> well
