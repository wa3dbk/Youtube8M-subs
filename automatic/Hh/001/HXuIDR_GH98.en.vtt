00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.430 
on the phone and drive it out to your TV
you're<00:03:34.300> not<00:03:34.450> just<00:03:34.600> later<00:03:34.870> boy<00:03:35.200> yeah<00:03:37.410> by<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you're not just later boy yeah by the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:47.520 
you're not just later boy yeah by the
small<00:03:38.860> screen<00:03:39.130> space<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:46.540> could<00:03:47.140> use<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.470> as

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
small screen space you could use this as

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.199 
small screen space you could use this as
a<00:03:47.709> game<00:03:47.920> controller<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.790> use<00:03:48.880> different

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
a game controller and use different

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.890 
a game controller and use different
devices<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:49.870> control

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
devices in control

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:04.930 
devices in control
we<00:03:51.900> need<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.140> be<00:03:52.260> are<00:04:03.440> quality<00:04:04.440> would<00:04:04.590> be

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
we need to be are quality would be

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.590 
we need to be are quality would be
similar<00:04:07.040> it's<00:04:09.950> it's<00:04:10.950> not<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.940> lot<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.480> do

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
similar it's it's not really a lot to do

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.880 
similar it's it's not really a lot to do
in<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.870> distance<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.959> get<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> pair<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.560> high

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
in this distance you get a pair of high

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.300 
in this distance you get a pair of high
resolutions<00:04:20.580> this<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:20.850> all<00:04:21.740> high<00:04:22.740> resolutions

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
resolutions this is all high resolutions

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.460 
resolutions this is all high resolutions
and<00:04:23.640> they<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:26.220> done<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:27.660> course<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.290> know<00:04:28.380> if

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
and they is done of course you know if

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.410 
and they is done of course you know if
you<00:04:28.530> look<00:04:28.680> at<00:04:28.740> standards<00:04:29.220> they<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.430> all<00:04:29.640> but

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
you look at standards they have all but

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.520 
you look at standards they have all but
in<00:04:30.510> today's<00:04:30.930> that's<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.040> standard

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.530 

feature<00:04:37.530> yeah<00:04:38.010> did<00:04:38.280> not<00:04:38.430> increase<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.060> number

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
feature yeah did not increase the number

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.360 
feature yeah did not increase the number
of<00:04:39.600> pixels<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.110> increased<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.800> features

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.150 

power<00:04:47.370> form-factor<00:04:48.800> various<00:04:49.800> kinds<00:04:50.070> of

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
power form-factor various kinds of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:06.590 
power form-factor various kinds of
control<00:04:50.750> number<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.810> differences<00:05:05.540> this<00:05:06.540> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
control number of differences this is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.590 
control number of differences this is
you<00:05:07.470> can<00:05:07.620> think<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:07.860> is<00:05:08.010> more<00:05:08.280> going<00:05:08.600> hardware

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
you can think of is more going hardware

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.930 
you can think of is more going hardware
during<00:05:09.900> interphase<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:11.190> definitely<00:05:11.669> layer

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
during interphase there definitely layer

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.490 
during interphase there definitely layer
two<00:05:12.240> kinds<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.690> functions<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.630> what<00:05:19.380> I'm

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
two kinds of functions that so what I'm

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500 
two kinds of functions that so what I'm
trying<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.890> do<00:05:19.980> here<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:22.070> bring<00:05:23.070> up<00:05:23.510> something

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
trying to do here is bring up something

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:33.530 
trying to do here is bring up something
anderson<00:05:25.140> data<00:05:25.320> into<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:28.380> on<00:05:28.980> you

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:42.450 

travelers<00:05:40.590> we're<00:05:41.590> using<00:05:41.800> one<00:05:42.040> before<00:05:42.370> oh<00:05:42.430> I

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
travelers we're using one before oh I

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.800 
travelers we're using one before oh I
said<00:05:42.760> yeah<00:05:42.940> thanks<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.150> again<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:49.450> coming

said yeah thanks so this again is coming
off<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.080> phone

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.720 

yeah<00:05:56.820> can<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.910> have<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.090> too

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.920 

this<00:06:08.040> is<00:06:09.040> an<00:06:09.370> MHL<00:06:09.820> tooth<00:06:11.400> but<00:06:12.400> I<00:06:12.970> don't

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
this is an MHL tooth but I don't

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.540 
this is an MHL tooth but I don't
don't<00:06:14.260> believe<00:06:14.410> this<00:06:14.560> device<00:06:14.890> actually

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
don't believe this device actually

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.250 
don't believe this device actually
supports<00:06:16.060> in<00:06:16.180> 3d<00:06:16.570> here<00:06:16.780> at<00:06:16.840> least<00:06:16.930> we<00:06:17.140> don't

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
supports in 3d here at least we don't

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.540 
supports in 3d here at least we don't
have<00:06:17.290> a<00:06:17.380> 3d<00:06:17.770> demonstration<00:06:22.320> okay<00:06:23.320> I<00:06:23.740> guess<00:06:24.010> you

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
have a 3d demonstration okay I guess you

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.230 
have a 3d demonstration okay I guess you
just<00:06:24.580> typed<00:06:24.970> hello<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:27.400> is<00:06:27.790> the<00:06:27.970> keyboard

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
just typed hello so is the keyboard

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.020 
just typed hello so is the keyboard
entry<00:06:28.600> going
