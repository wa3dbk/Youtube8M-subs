00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello youtube com to a new video 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.160
 everyone here is phoenix and we see 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.290
 in the background yes today again 14 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.639
 the third consequence is it I believe 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.860
 I am so sorry that I have come so long 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.949
 but it is such a act here 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.560
 do not see my opponent here like that 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 gigantic and I state directly over the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 side with shaqiri by the way always 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.420
 nor the obertrave is so fast here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 has a lot of good tricks on it and pushes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 the loader hits the ball against the keeper 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.770
 yes here the opponent gives an account 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.410
 the box I can not disengage 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 cried that it was the enemy was real 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 damn well here is alone again 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 in front of the gate, guests score zero 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 I do not know what's up 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.039
 it's kind of been real poor 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 I have the chance here with a pitcher 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.789
 sometimes overlap and unfortunately leaves nothing 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.239
 somehow no shot came 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.309
 come out again with the chance 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.359
 yes, who was it I do not know 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.129
 just was not on him a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.989
 scarce chance there she has often 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.180
 licked as noticed and then you do 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.490
 Kiessling one a nice gate and above 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
 very very important goal 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.020
 down in the angle no chance 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.630
 If the prices kießling is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.220
 somehow his money was worth it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 he did not cost much and I cash 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 then 31 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.330
 in the 38 minute the opponent got me one 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 completely destroyed and 41 I do not know 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 as you were and but I 'm lucky 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 had and somehow the connection 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 canceled and that was not mine 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 connection yes so somehow yes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.900
 actually quite cool so now 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.880
 for me did not count the game and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 Then it started slowly the problems 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.899
 with the contracts at the just not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.899
 play with this classic system game 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.549
 my so and that's why I always had 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.930
 individually gold contracts with 200 and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.399
 I have manager in the beginning 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.969
 defend cost idiot I 've got myself 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.939
 watch out 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.590
 and so unfortunately kießling and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.430
 For example, had to rausstellen with 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.780
 play and have my team 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.190
 stop now no poster at the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.050
 opponent does not wait too well and kicks 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.379
 charts their value in the rest of the episode yet 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500
 see 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.240
 the guy is somehow 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 crass even if he somehow I can 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.330
 think bronze first or it can too 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 So its silver but that's somehow 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.600
 totally strong on the front and here knows 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.240
 I was not what was going on 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.380
 opponent stands from the gate but benaglio the 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.620
 most important man in my team 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.330
 keeps the team to zero to zero yet 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.450
 Next richards here again from the gate 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.740
 the packaged leaves a flank 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.209
 in the middle and nice flying head 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.360
 would have been earned 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.610
 in the margin again very close so that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.870
 was a difficult game the opponent has 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.959
 not many, right now 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.510
 opportunities but I just do not have to 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.580
 managed to make the gate that you see 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.100
 Already here a lot of rum and rum 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.250
 try it here but it was offside 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.600
 Shit ran counterpart in the middle 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.489
 also had become nothing and so that was 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.010
 nothing half nothing 0 to 0 to 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.270
 half 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.190
 somehow we disabled because of this 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.780
 are only a few shitty ones 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.400
 shot then take a look at that 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.890
 do not go together over the page here 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.750
 really much space 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.220
 really a lot of space, the and, unfortunately, 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.530
 nothing has become such a thing 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.299
 would like to keep shot and richards still 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.670
 sometimes in the margin but that was nice 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.799
 who was very nice of the charts as I said 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.350
 he can do something else andré here 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.150
 chance is it's just nothing on the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.560
 row gone to the yes I have nothing 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.769
 series on the get here again very 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.019
 alone before the gate andré tries and becomes 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.370
 that's how it looks 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.360
 one more repetition everything was so one 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.060
 clear eleven meters 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.519
 how it hooks my legs off 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.260
 that too was ridiculous he would have like 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 hermes not break off i screamed 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.400
 it was really something I do not see 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500
 here again a good chance grabs 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.060
 ball submitted too far and in the 90th 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.110
 minute as much space at a point gate 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.640
 was then unfortunately 1 0 to 0 you have to 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.370
 accept and even discuss the game there before 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.440
 already blown to happiness 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.820
 I think I have here now I believe 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.450
 I have shade here again inside 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.650
 I'm not sure and I'm fine 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.810
 actually quite good going on 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.739
 he wants I try using one I know 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.560
 my chances were here somehow 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.740
 the day not exactly sovereign as well as 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.680
 richards 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.949
 yes, good try more but not synonymous 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.229
 and here again my legs are gone 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.810
 I could not set every time 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.130
 disengage didier is always only eleven meters 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.319
 give if you press on clapping but 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.780
 wonderful miracles here 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.669
 beautifully by richard slinked 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.259
 I was so proud that he was in there 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.030
 a pretty wise special 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.340
 goalkeeper but because it's just brutal 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.130
 important and redeeming was and the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.120
 Richards the just beautiful recycled 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.520
 even if you do not believe it 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.430
 such a player here again more beautiful 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.220
 pass on others and turn the middle and 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.870
 Richards with his head quite elegant in 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.669
 the 18 minute 20th gate 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.169
 the opponent does not have any more 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.330
 so many chances are not so much anymore 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.120
 Chance tells you how brutally strong in here 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:18.090
 the middle andré also nice and easy 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.680
 brutally elegant and provocative 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.729
 the enemy goes out has no desire 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.979
 more that is always a bit 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.330
 onerous at 414 or at ultimate team 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.750
 generally that the opponent always raus 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.389
 go 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.039
 I am the second league I am 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.440
 I think and the opponents are still 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.750
 that's all because of that 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.800
 spectacular dg the opponent's friend 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.630
 had a slightly better team at the start 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.889
 had Milito in the front in the fast 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.620
 black so there it was already 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.240
 difficult richardson across the page 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.080
 nice in the middle 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.199
 lausanne deceives and richards does that 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.300
 The thing is that it is sovereign that is one 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.580
 very good chance of exploitation of the animal 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.190
 and nothing goes together with the opponent 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.830
 Such a few would like to chance again 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.120
 here , what was that good of me 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.560
 try in such a nice shot of 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.440
 firmino if it was in there 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.229
 Look at that which should have been in there 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.960
 must have been awesome and horny now 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.099
 I would have been happy and that would be me 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.990
 cool as it andrea will also again to 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.000
 one of the gate had chances here 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.560
 Chances about the latte so chipped the 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.270
 must achim from now you have the things 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.199
 Unfortunately chipping was on too long 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.830
 stayed and then I stop 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.050
 Kopfballtor 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.430
 As I said , tomorrow is always like 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.979
 fifa I can somehow be there 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.810
 you do not do anything as a defense 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.060
 here so the 2 0 at half-time my team 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.950
 I am pleased and then have 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.560
 I could send you back here 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.060
 pitcher my silver player of course 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.420
 a good performance is delivered to the 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.100
 1 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.030
 is my team here 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.980
 a bit of a helpless shot 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.450
 shoot a return on goal like 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.550
 he would say the fifa commentators 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.410
 opponents here also dad two shots flat 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.030
 So that has nothing in the row 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.530
 brought 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.060
 we see what we see here nice ball 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.030
 removed from the jug that pulls off 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.880
 nothing has become pitcher again and that 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.780
 is bremen yes these are the gates 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.670
 I always do so with luck 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.590
 simply as I said with good luck 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.720
 somehow just decided 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.040
 and that was the must have me 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.230
 but I wanted that four to zero 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.730
 there is still shooting in the principle 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.770
 Shit I know the opponent not he 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.510
 I came to lick ass and that's why 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.120
 is it all cool chilliger suits 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.010
 shaqiri who then has a lot of space and it 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.510
 Sounds elegant but wants to push it 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.460
 does not go, he wanted to wanted to 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.170
 André have a nice one here 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.100
 beautiful set over the latte 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.270
 yes the chance exploitation could be something 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.370
 a thin I play too 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.590
 insignificantly higher and thus that was 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.260
 The same goes for the game too 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.660
 last chance in the 90 minute kempe 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.660
 Fool some nice shot and then 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.380
 purely geschlenzt 15 I was mega 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.460
 satisfied 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.560
 I would always be a positive one 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.450
 rating rejoice or rating 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.770
 In general that helped me so 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.480
 next ones may be different 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.410
 expire is a poll as 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.910
 I'll get it next 

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.670
 it was a bit different 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.510
 is pretty much expense and therefore 

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.400
 I would be happy if much 

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.320
 Thank you for the beautiful skin 

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.730
 pure new case not I'm out a 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.730
 Wonder wonderful day
