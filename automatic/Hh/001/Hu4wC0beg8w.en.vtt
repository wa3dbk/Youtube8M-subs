00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
gone into my brushes and PSP and let's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.740 
gone into my brushes and PSP and let's
see<00:00:15.770> get<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.010> spiky<00:00:17.760> twirl<00:00:19.340> more<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.939> we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
see get the spiky twirl more use that we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
see get the spiky twirl more use that we
got<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.410> different<00:00:22.590> sizes<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.430> be

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
got like three different sizes will be

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.450 
got like three different sizes will be
using<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.240> large<00:00:24.570> large<00:00:25.289> size<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
using this large large size and then the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
using this large large size and then the
medium<00:00:27.230> that's<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.710> think<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.250> work

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
medium that's what I think it will work

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.089 
medium that's what I think it will work
out<00:00:29.580> good<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.090> won't<00:00:30.869> cut<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> size<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.769> here

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
out good I won't cut the size down here

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
out good I won't cut the size down here
this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.669> default<00:00:32.910> size<00:00:33.590> cut<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> down<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this is default size cut it down a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.030 
this is default size cut it down a
little<00:00:35.160> bit<00:00:35.630> we're<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> make<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.320> little

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
little bit we're going to make a little

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.100 
little bit we're going to make a little
shape<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> tree<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:45.110> just

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
shape here for like a tree that and just

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.350 
shape here for like a tree that and just
kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> fill<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.579> here

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360

layer down underneath so it's not that
I'm<00:01:48.330> Peyton<00:01:48.720> over<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:51.150> am<00:01:51.300> am

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I'm Peyton over this like I am am

painting over it but it won't we're
going<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.140> slide<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.410> down<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.040> won't<00:01:56.250> look

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
going to slide it down so it won't look

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.899 
going to slide it down so it won't look
like<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.830> got<00:01:58.830> bust<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.340> covered<00:01:59.730> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like this I got bust of them covered and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.110 
like this I got bust of them covered and
when<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.180> slide<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.960> takes<00:02:01.200> out<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:02.120> lot

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
when we slide it down it takes out a lot

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.070 
when we slide it down it takes out a lot
of<00:02:03.210> those<00:02:03.360> transparent<00:02:04.140> areas<00:02:05.720> come<00:02:06.720> on<00:02:06.870> down

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
of those transparent areas come on down

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.360 
of those transparent areas come on down
baby<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.830> we<00:02:07.980> go<00:02:08.330> make<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.510> layer<00:02:10.370> see

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
baby there we go make this layer see

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.720 
baby there we go make this layer see
that's<00:02:11.519> like<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.850> pretty<00:02:12.180> nice<00:02:12.330> Christmas<00:02:12.870> tree

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

that's like a pretty nice Christmas tree
let's<00:02:14.730> add<00:02:14.940> another<00:02:14.970> layer<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.959> let's<00:02:16.380> have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
let's add another layer and let's have

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.949 
let's add another layer and let's have
add<00:02:16.950> some<00:02:17.400> tinsel<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.269> or<00:02:18.510> something<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
add some tinsel to it or something that

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.380 
add some tinsel to it or something that
looks<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.320> little<00:02:19.470> bit<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.830> tensile<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.550> need

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
looks a little bit like tensile I need

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.949 
looks a little bit like tensile I need
change<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:22.340> about<00:02:23.340> any<00:02:23.580> kind<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.000> flat<00:02:24.269> silvery

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
change to about any kind of flat silvery

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.420 
change to about any kind of flat silvery
pattern<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.769> don't<00:02:26.519> like<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.150> here's<00:02:27.959> one<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
pattern I don't like it here's one that

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.340 
pattern I don't like it here's one that
all<00:02:29.670> were<00:02:29.880> pretty<00:02:30.180> good<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:32.750> see<00:02:33.750> will<00:02:33.989> change

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
all were pretty good and see will change

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.300 
all were pretty good and see will change
to<00:02:35.239> another<00:02:36.239> spiky<00:02:36.959> twirl<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.040> it'll<00:02:38.280> be

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
to another spiky twirl here but it'll be

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.280 
to another spiky twirl here but it'll be
medium<00:02:39.120> science

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.259 

and<00:02:45.319> see<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.439> want<00:02:46.769> green<00:02:47.129> on<00:02:47.400> top<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.090> would

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
and see I want green on top so we would

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.539 
and see I want green on top so we would
be<00:02:48.359> taking<00:02:48.540> part<00:02:48.930> green<00:02:49.349> part<00:02:49.769> silver<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.400> we

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549
