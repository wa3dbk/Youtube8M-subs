any machine of course the furnace over
there<00:00:21.060> or<00:00:21.420> something<00:00:22.050> has<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> make<00:00:22.439> some

there or something has to make some

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.029 
there or something has to make some
noise<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.039> anyway<00:00:24.380> does<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:25.710> copper

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
noise but anyway does have some copper

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.349 
noise but anyway does have some copper
slag<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:26.910> gave<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
slag in there because I just gave it a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.990 
slag in there because I just gave it a
quick<00:00:27.480> sound<00:00:27.779> blast<00:00:28.220> I've<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.730> port's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
quick sound blast I've got the port's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
quick sound blast I've got the port's
blocked<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.779> tape<00:00:30.990> there<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> don't

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
blocked with just tape there now I don't

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
blocked with just tape there now I don't
want<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.219> turn<00:00:32.309> over<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.669> piston<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.329> I'm

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
want to turn over the piston because I'm

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.880 
want to turn over the piston because I'm
sure<00:00:33.750> there's<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.680> that's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
sure there's some in there that's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.160 
sure there's some in there that's
going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.190> damaged<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
going to get damaged so I'm not going to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.330 
going to get damaged so I'm not going to
do<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> by<00:00:37.500> hand<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> give<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
do it by hand I'm going to give it a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
do it by hand I'm going to give it a
quick<00:00:38.520> zap<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> impact<00:00:39.570> gun

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
quick zap with the impact gun

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.709 
quick zap with the impact gun
hopefully<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> bolt<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.250> come<00:00:41.430> loose<00:00:41.719> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hopefully the bolt will come loose and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.580 
hopefully the bolt will come loose and
it<00:00:43.590> won't<00:00:43.739> turn<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> flywheel<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.590> chances

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it won't turn the flywheel so chances

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.479 
it won't turn the flywheel so chances
are<00:00:46.649> well<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.489> find<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> if

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
are well I don't but I'll find out so if

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.930 
are well I don't but I'll find out so if
I<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.730> did<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.350> with<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.160> would<00:00:53.850> have

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I would did that with this I would have

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.160 
I would did that with this I would have
turned<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> scratch<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
turned it and scratch the out of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
turned it and scratch the out of
everything<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:56.340> course<00:00:56.550> everything's<00:00:56.940> very

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
everything of course everything's very
