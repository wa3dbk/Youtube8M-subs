00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
of you who might be importing from a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.020 
of you who might be importing from a
hard<00:00:17.960> drive<00:00:18.110> and<00:00:19.070> want<00:00:19.280> to<00:00:19.310> keep<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:19.610> files<00:00:19.850> in

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
hard drive and want to keep the files in

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.370 
hard drive and want to keep the files in
the<00:00:20.120> hard<00:00:20.270> drive<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:20.660> will<00:00:20.810> be<00:00:20.870> especially

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
the hard drive this will be especially

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.380 
the hard drive this will be especially
big<00:00:21.590> to<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:22.070> when<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:22.730> import<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:23.240> can

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
big to you when you import you can

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.360 
big to you when you import you can
actually<00:00:23.540> build<00:00:23.990> these<00:00:24.230> smart<00:00:24.590> previews<00:00:25.130> here

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
actually build these smart previews here

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.460 
actually build these smart previews here
when<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.210> import<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.810> what<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.050> does<00:00:27.200> is<00:00:27.380> it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
when you import and what that does is it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.030 
when you import and what that does is it
creates<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.950> dmg<00:00:28.520> file<00:00:28.820> at<00:00:29.410> 2500<00:00:30.410> pixels<00:00:30.530> and

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
creates a dmg file at 2500 pixels and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.280 
creates a dmg file at 2500 pixels and
that<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.059> what<00:00:32.239> Lightroom<00:00:32.629> is<00:00:32.780> using<00:00:33.140> right

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
that is what Lightroom is using right

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.680 
that is what Lightroom is using right
now<00:00:33.320> because<00:00:33.620> my<00:00:33.920> hard<00:00:34.129> drive<00:00:34.280> is<00:00:34.460> actually

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
now because my hard drive is actually

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.060 
now because my hard drive is actually
disconnected<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.320> these<00:00:36.499> files<00:00:36.829> are

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
disconnected and so these files are

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.860 
disconnected and so these files are
offline<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.609> so<00:00:37.969> what<00:00:38.089> we<00:00:38.210> see<00:00:38.420> here<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.749> this

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
offline and so what we see here is this

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.509 
offline and so what we see here is this
little<00:00:39.170> black<00:00:39.379> box<00:00:39.410> letting<00:00:40.070> us<00:00:40.190> know<00:00:40.219> we're

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
little black box letting us know we're

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.910 
little black box letting us know we're
in<00:00:40.609> offline<00:00:40.909> mode<00:00:41.059> now<00:00:41.989> this<00:00:42.199> means<00:00:42.469> that<00:00:42.620> if<00:00:42.800> i

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
in offline mode now this means that if i

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.770 
in offline mode now this means that if i
zoom<00:00:42.949> in<00:00:43.399> I<00:00:43.550> can't<00:00:43.789> get<00:00:43.969> nearly<00:00:44.179> as<00:00:44.329> far<00:00:44.600> these

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
zoom in I can't get nearly as far these

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.229 
zoom in I can't get nearly as far these
are<00:00:44.839> 5700<00:00:45.800> pixels<00:00:46.550> on<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.789> width<00:00:46.999> but<00:00:47.120> I'm

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
are 5700 pixels on the width but I'm

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.360 
are 5700 pixels on the width but I'm
only<00:00:47.480> able<00:00:47.749> to<00:00:48.050> zoom<00:00:48.289> in<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.679> what<00:00:49.100> would<00:00:49.219> be

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
only able to zoom in to what would be

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.239 
only able to zoom in to what would be
the<00:00:49.550> equivalent<00:00:49.789> of<00:00:50.140> 2500<00:00:51.140> however<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.100> am

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
the equivalent of 2500 however I am

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.209 
the equivalent of 2500 however I am
still<00:00:52.399> able<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.690> make<00:00:53.899> all<00:00:54.170> my<00:00:54.440> adjustments<00:00:55.100> on

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
still able to make all my adjustments on

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
this as if it was an actual file and

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.919 
this as if it was an actual file and
then<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.149> go<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.449> make<00:00:59.600> some<00:00:59.629> adjustments

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
then if I go and make some adjustments

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
plug back in my hard drive and when we

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.200 
plug back in my hard drive and when we
do<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.320> these<00:01:12.560> files<00:01:12.890> are<00:01:13.280> going<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.759> come

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
do that these files are going to come

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.630 
do that these files are going to come
back<00:01:14.420> online<00:01:14.719> in<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.320> little<00:01:15.560> bit<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.979> my<00:01:16.460> hard

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
back online in a little bit and my hard

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.399 
back online in a little bit and my hard
drive<00:01:16.790> has<00:01:16.909> just<00:01:17.090> come<00:01:17.270> back<00:01:17.299> on<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.020> there<00:01:18.229> we

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
drive has just come back on and there we

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.529 
drive has just come back on and there we
have<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:19.219> the<00:01:19.430> black<00:01:19.729> box<00:01:20.000> disappeared

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
have that the black box disappeared

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.600 
have that the black box disappeared
right<00:01:20.719> there<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.079> so<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.350> means<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:22.250> am

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
right there and so that means that I am

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.700 
right there and so that means that I am
no<00:01:22.789> longer<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.360> offline<00:01:23.719> mode<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.469> now

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
no longer in offline mode and so now

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.069 
no longer in offline mode and so now
when<00:01:24.920> i<00:01:25.009> zoom<00:01:25.039> in<00:01:25.430> I'm<00:01:25.640> actually<00:01:26.119> able<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.840> zoom

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
when i zoom in I'm actually able to zoom

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.340 
when i zoom in I'm actually able to zoom
in<00:01:27.289> into<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.829> full<00:01:28.240> original<00:01:29.240> pixel<00:01:29.780> size<00:01:29.990> and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
in into the full original pixel size and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.020 
in into the full original pixel size and
now<00:01:30.500> when<00:01:30.649> we<00:01:30.740> go<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.950> develop<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:31.789> notice

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
now when we go to develop we can notice

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.270 
now when we go to develop we can notice
that<00:01:32.060> all<00:01:32.359> my<00:01:32.539> editing<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:33.140> still<00:01:33.409> there<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.250> I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
that all my editing is still there so I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.370 
that all my editing is still there so I
can<00:01:34.490> actually<00:01:35.000> completely<00:01:35.479> edit<00:01:35.960> all<00:01:36.109> of<00:01:36.259> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
can actually completely edit all of the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.950 
can actually completely edit all of the
files<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.859> offline<00:01:37.460> mode<00:01:37.609> as<00:01:38.090> long<00:01:38.689> as<00:01:38.840> I'm

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
files in offline mode as long as I'm

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
okay editing on 2500 pixels and then it

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.709 
okay editing on 2500 pixels and then it
will<00:01:42.380> modify<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.789> to<00:01:44.030> go<00:01:44.299> with<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.539> full

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719

and another one is going to be the a

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.679 
and another one is going to be the a
brush<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:55.130> we<00:01:55.310> used<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.820> use<00:01:56.030> actually<00:01:56.509> not

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
brush that we used to use actually not

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.840 
brush that we used to use actually not
that<00:01:56.869> one<00:01:57.049> I'm<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.590> use<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.009> brush<00:01:58.700> that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
that one I'm going to use the brush that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.700 
that one I'm going to use the brush that
we<00:01:58.939> used<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.299> use<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> get<00:01:59.780> rid<00:01:59.960> of<00:01:59.990> objects<00:02:00.530> now

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
we used to use to get rid of objects now

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.969 
we used to use to get rid of objects now
originally<00:02:01.100> some<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.999> these<00:02:02.119> files<00:02:02.799> like<00:02:03.799> I'm

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
originally some of these files like I'm

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.410 
originally some of these files like I'm
a<00:02:04.130> zoom<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.030> would<00:02:05.179> have<00:02:05.270> been<00:02:05.359> a

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
a zoom in on this this would have been a

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.239 
a zoom in on this this would have been a
very<00:02:05.600> hard<00:02:05.840> thing<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.140> get<00:02:06.380> rid<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.740> before<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
very hard thing to get rid of before I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:08.469 
very hard thing to get rid of before I
would<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:07.579> probably<00:02:07.759> taken<00:02:07.939> this<00:02:08.300> into

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
would have probably taken this into

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.540 
would have probably taken this into
Photoshop<00:02:09.110> because<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:10.039> would<00:02:10.159> have<00:02:10.280> drawn<00:02:10.519> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
Photoshop because it would have drawn a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.660 
Photoshop because it would have drawn a
circle<00:02:10.879> and<00:02:11.269> then<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.500> were<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.800> expand<00:02:13.489> my

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
circle and then if I were to expand my

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.730 
circle and then if I were to expand my
brush<00:02:13.970> size<00:02:14.150> say<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> hear<00:02:15.080> it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
brush size say to hear it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.890 
brush size say to hear it
have<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.070> looked<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:16.490> another<00:02:16.850> circle<00:02:17.570> area

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
have just looked for another circle area

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.390 
have just looked for another circle area
right<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:18.500> gonna<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.220> little

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
right here and it's gonna be a little

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.980 
right here and it's gonna be a little
more<00:02:19.520> difficult<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.420> rid<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.630> something

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
more difficult to get rid of something

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.560 
more difficult to get rid of something
of<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.380> shape<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.700> what's<00:02:22.970> new<00:02:23.240> with<00:02:23.450> this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
of that shape now what's new with this

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.780 
of that shape now what's new with this
brush<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.140> now<00:02:24.710> when<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.010> click<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:25.490> brush

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
brush is now when I click on this brush

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.180 
brush is now when I click on this brush
let<00:02:25.970> me<00:02:26.060> go<00:02:26.180> ahead<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.390> delete<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.900> one

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
let me go ahead and delete that one

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.650 
let me go ahead and delete that one
rather<00:02:28.190> than<00:02:28.490> creating<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.150> big<00:02:29.390> large

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
rather than creating this big large

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.420 
rather than creating this big large
circle<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.320> actually<00:02:30.500> shrink<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
circle I can actually shrink that and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.060 
circle I can actually shrink that and
then<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.790> paint<00:02:32.240> on<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:33.380> area<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:33.950> I'd

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
then just paint on the area that I'd

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.640 
then just paint on the area that I'd
like<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.310> get<00:02:34.580> rid<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:35.050> just<00:02:36.050> like<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.350> would<00:02:36.500> in

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
like to get rid of just like we would in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.890 
like to get rid of just like we would in
Photoshop<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.030> area<00:02:38.450> now<00:02:38.660> is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
Photoshop and then that area now is

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.340 
Photoshop and then that area now is
going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.430> be<00:02:40.630> overrun<00:02:41.630> with<00:02:41.840> another<00:02:42.110> area

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
going to be overrun with another area

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.860 
going to be overrun with another area
and<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.770> still<00:02:42.980> choose<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.490> area<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.180> it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and I can still choose that area and it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080 
and I can still choose that area and it
does<00:02:45.020> an<00:02:45.140> ok<00:02:45.410> job<00:02:45.640> Photoshop<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.820> still<00:02:47.060> a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
does an ok job Photoshop is still a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.430 
does an ok job Photoshop is still a
little<00:02:47.270> bit<00:02:47.480> better<00:02:47.630> at<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:47.990> but<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.260> can

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
little bit better at this but I can

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
little bit better at this but I can
still<00:02:48.680> choose<00:02:48.980> my<00:02:49.220> area<00:02:49.610> where<00:02:49.820> it's<00:02:49.970> going<00:02:50.090> to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
still choose my area where it's going to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.870 
still choose my area where it's going to
pick<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:51.080> from<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.710> that<00:02:52.160> area<00:02:52.550> will<00:02:52.730> not

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
pick that from and that area will not

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.060 
pick that from and that area will not
disappear<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.170> here's<00:02:54.440> another<00:02:54.650> area

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
disappear and so here's another area

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.590 
disappear and so here's another area
right<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:55.340> where<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.820> just<00:02:56.150> take<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
right here where I can just take and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.590 
right here where I can just take and
brush<00:02:57.020> brush<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.580> area<00:02:58.940> right<00:02:59.000> there<00:02:59.210> and

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
brush brush in that area right there and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.770 
brush brush in that area right there and
it'll<00:03:00.500> get<00:03:00.650> rid<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.010> part<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.880> overall

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
it'll get rid of that part so overall

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.410 
it'll get rid of that part so overall
much<00:03:03.110> improved<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.400> take<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> bunch<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.240> less

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
much improved I can take a bunch of less

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.750 
much improved I can take a bunch of less
files<00:03:05.720> into<00:03:06.050> Photoshop<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.040> get<00:03:07.250> rid<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.520> that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.650 
like this where my focus point is going
to<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.770> around<00:03:22.070> them<00:03:22.310> I'd<00:03:22.790> love<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.270> be<00:03:23.360> able<00:03:23.540> to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
to be around them I'd love to be able to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.310 
to be around them I'd love to be able to
create<00:03:23.960> this<00:03:24.230> filter<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:25.520> going<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.320> just

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
create this filter that's going to just

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.160 
create this filter that's going to just
be<00:03:27.440> around<00:03:27.890> them<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.240> what<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.720> do<00:03:29.930> is

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
be around them and so what I can do is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.310 
be around them and so what I can do is
drag<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> filter<00:03:31.490> and<00:03:31.700> put<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.630> over<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:33.080> and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
drag a filter and put it over them and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.920 
drag a filter and put it over them and
now<00:03:33.890> all<00:03:34.160> my<00:03:34.210> modifications<00:03:35.210> now<00:03:35.420> if<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.660> wanted

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
now all my modifications now if I wanted

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
now all my modifications now if I wanted
to<00:03:36.020> do<00:03:36.140> increase<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.680> exposure<00:03:37.070> are<00:03:37.430> going<00:03:37.940> to

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
to do increase the exposure are going to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.840 
to do increase the exposure are going to
be<00:03:38.150> overall<00:03:38.990> but<00:03:39.440> not<00:03:39.740> on<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.280> area<00:03:40.670> so

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
be overall but not on that area so

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.030 
be overall but not on that area so
basically<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:41.450> make<00:03:41.780> overall<00:03:42.350> adjustments

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
basically I can make overall adjustments

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.300 
basically I can make overall adjustments
on<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.280> image<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.880> I<00:03:44.660> can<00:03:44.870> affect<00:03:45.740> only<00:03:45.920> that

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
on this image and I can affect only that

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.220 
on this image and I can affect only that
outside<00:03:46.700> area<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.270> not<00:03:47.450> on<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> inside<00:03:47.930> we

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
outside area and not on the inside we

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.470 
outside area and not on the inside we
can<00:03:48.380> also<00:03:48.530> invert<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.370> mask<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.910> reverse<00:03:50.270> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
can also invert the mask to reverse the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.470 
can also invert the mask to reverse the
area<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.440> basically<00:03:51.860> very<00:03:52.310> quickly<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:53.000> can

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
area but basically very quickly I can

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.060 
area but basically very quickly I can
make<00:03:53.690> all<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.960> these<00:03:54.200> adjustments<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
make all of these adjustments to the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.210 
make all of these adjustments to the
outside<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.790> not<00:03:56.210> affect<00:03:56.750> them<00:03:56.960> at<00:03:57.260> all<00:03:57.560> so

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
outside and not affect them at all so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.270 
outside and not affect them at all so
they<00:03:58.370> are<00:03:58.460> still<00:03:58.790> going<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.090> be<00:03:59.240> normal<00:04:00.280> just

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
they are still going to be normal just

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.310 
they are still going to be normal just
like<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.550> had<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.880> picture<00:04:02.180> before<00:04:02.570> but<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.140> of

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
like I had the picture before but all of

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.870 
like I had the picture before but all of
these<00:04:03.440> other<00:04:03.710> global<00:04:04.130> adjustments<00:04:04.820> have

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
these other global adjustments have

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.940 
these other global adjustments have
happened<00:04:05.300> to<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> outside<00:04:05.740> extremely<00:04:06.740> quick

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
happened to the outside extremely quick

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.290 
happened to the outside extremely quick
I<00:04:07.070> would<00:04:07.220> have<00:04:07.310> had<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.490> paint<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.120> it

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
I would have had to paint that in it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.300 
I would have had to paint that in it
wouldn't<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.600> been<00:04:08.690> an<00:04:08.810> even<00:04:09.080> circle<00:04:09.470> one<00:04:10.190> of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
wouldn't have been an even circle one of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.010 
wouldn't have been an even circle one of
the<00:04:10.400> best<00:04:10.610> features<00:04:10.820> on<00:04:11.210> this<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.630> I'm<00:04:11.750> very

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
the best features on this and I'm very

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.320 
the best features on this and I'm very
happy<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.560> see<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.920> now<00:04:13.520> another<00:04:13.940> thing<00:04:14.180> on

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
happy to see that now another thing on

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.320 
happy to see that now another thing on
this<00:04:14.510> is<00:04:15.380> we<00:04:15.590> can<00:04:15.740> see<00:04:15.920> here<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.370> my<00:04:16.700> columns

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
this is we can see here that my columns

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.390 
this is we can see here that my columns
are<00:04:17.510> off<00:04:17.720> so<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.080> was<00:04:18.260> shooting<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:18.709> with<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.920> 24

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
are off so I was shooting this with a 24

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.180 
are off so I was shooting this with a 24
millimeter<00:04:19.640> lens<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.440> normally<00:04:21.770> when<00:04:22.160> I

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
millimeter lens and so normally when I

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.650 
millimeter lens and so normally when I
came<00:04:22.310> into<00:04:22.730> here<00:04:23.060> into<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:24.800> lens<00:04:25.790> correction<00:04:26.479> I

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
came into here into my lens correction I

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.629 
came into here into my lens correction I
could<00:04:27.320> do<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.770> normal

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
could do the normal

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.309 
could do the normal
Abell<00:04:28.999> profile<00:04:29.449> correction<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.020> can<00:04:30.169> see

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
Abell profile correction you can see

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.899 
Abell profile correction you can see
that<00:04:30.499> this<00:04:30.680> helped<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:31.039> whole<00:04:31.069> lot<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.610> took<00:04:31.759> off

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
that this helped a whole lot it took off

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.219 
that this helped a whole lot it took off
the<00:04:32.090> been<00:04:32.270> getting<00:04:32.659> it<00:04:32.780> straight<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.139> the

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
the been getting it straight in the

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.439 
the been getting it straight in the
picture<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:34.340> if<00:04:34.430> we<00:04:34.520> look<00:04:34.699> here<00:04:34.969> at<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.210> very

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
picture but if we look here at the very

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.260 
picture but if we look here at the very
bit<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.139> corner<00:04:36.590> we<00:04:37.099> can<00:04:37.279> see<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.819> my

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
bit of the corner we can see that my

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.600 
bit of the corner we can see that my
frame<00:04:39.080> right<00:04:39.349> here<00:04:39.590> also<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.099> can<00:04:40.129> remove<00:04:40.490> this

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
frame right here also I can remove this

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.689 
frame right here also I can remove this
chromatic<00:04:40.879> aberration<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:41.749> that

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
chromatic aberration and that

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.649 
chromatic aberration and that
disappeared<00:04:43.699> right<00:04:43.849> that<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.240> had<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.449> little

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
disappeared right that so I had a little

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.149 
disappeared right that so I had a little
bit<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.960> chromatic<00:04:45.199> aberration<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.949> side

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
bit of chromatic aberration on the side

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.219 
bit of chromatic aberration on the side
of<00:04:46.340> Etna<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.610> disappeared<00:04:47.180> but<00:04:47.599> this<00:04:47.749> column

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
of Etna it disappeared but this column

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.320 
of Etna it disappeared but this column
is<00:04:48.379> still<00:04:48.710> not<00:04:49.069> quite<00:04:49.370> even<00:04:49.699> it<00:04:49.969> gets<00:04:50.150> from

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
is still not quite even it gets from

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.179 
is still not quite even it gets from
small<00:04:50.689> here<00:04:50.930> up<00:04:51.139> then<00:04:51.319> to<00:04:51.439> the<00:04:51.560> top<00:04:51.770> there

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
small here up then to the top there

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.730 
small here up then to the top there
well<00:04:52.610> now<00:04:52.819> we<00:04:52.879> can<00:04:53.270> hit<00:04:53.300> this<00:04:53.629> auto<00:04:53.930> realign

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
well now we can hit this auto realign

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.519 
well now we can hit this auto realign
and<00:04:54.979> it's<00:04:55.849> going<00:04:55.999> to<00:04:56.060> go<00:04:56.240> ahead<00:04:56.389> and<00:04:56.810> analyze

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
and it's going to go ahead and analyze

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.260 
and it's going to go ahead and analyze
that<00:04:57.860> image<00:04:58.219> and<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.490> can<00:04:58.520> see<00:04:58.699> that<00:04:59.120> it

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
that image and you can see that it

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.360 
that image and you can see that it
straightened<00:04:59.749> it<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:00.710> does<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.889> very<00:05:00.979> good

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
straightened it and it does a very good

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.059 
straightened it and it does a very good
job<00:05:01.580> of<00:05:01.639> getting<00:05:01.909> in<00:05:02.210> there<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.479> we<00:05:02.539> can<00:05:02.569> even

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
job of getting in there and we can even

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.119 
job of getting in there and we can even
reanalyze<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.099> image<00:05:04.580> if<00:05:04.699> we<00:05:04.729> want<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
reanalyze the image if we want to and

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.010 
reanalyze the image if we want to and
sometimes<00:05:07.129> it<00:05:07.279> lets<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.789> so<00:05:08.689> let<00:05:08.810> me<00:05:08.870> turn

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
sometimes it lets you and so let me turn

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.480 
sometimes it lets you and so let me turn
that<00:05:09.169> off<00:05:09.379> and<00:05:09.409> then<00:05:09.680> turn<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:09.889> back<00:05:10.039> on<00:05:10.310> again

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
that off and then turn it back on again

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.279 
that off and then turn it back on again
and<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:10.909> can<00:05:11.060> see<00:05:11.270> that<00:05:11.479> that<00:05:11.659> column<00:05:11.930> right

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
and you can see that that column right

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.439 
and you can see that that column right
there<00:05:12.319> straightened<00:05:13.099> right<00:05:13.340> up<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.759> that<00:05:14.330> was

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
there straightened right up and that was

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.629 
there straightened right up and that was
a<00:05:14.479> big<00:05:14.779> feature<00:05:15.020> on<00:05:15.379> that<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.770> let<00:05:16.189> me<00:05:16.279> pull<00:05:16.490> in

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
a big feature on that and let me pull in

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.969 
a big feature on that and let me pull in
this<00:05:16.789> one<00:05:17.000> too<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.509> if<00:05:18.139> I<00:05:18.259> take<00:05:18.469> this<00:05:18.650> into<00:05:18.949> the

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
this one too and if I take this into the

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.790 
this one too and if I take this into the
develop<00:05:19.490> module<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.509> apply<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:21.319> normal

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
develop module I can apply the normal

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.769 
develop module I can apply the normal
profile<00:05:22.189> correction<00:05:22.759> and<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:23.330> can<00:05:23.449> see<00:05:23.599> that

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
profile correction and you can see that

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.600 
profile correction and you can see that
that<00:05:23.900> did<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.110> great<00:05:24.439> job<00:05:24.469> but<00:05:24.979> taking<00:05:25.339> a<00:05:25.430> look

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
that did a great job but taking a look

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.879 
that did a great job but taking a look
at<00:05:25.729> some<00:05:25.939> of<00:05:26.029> these<00:05:26.089> lines<00:05:26.479> here<00:05:26.990> we<00:05:27.529> can<00:05:27.710> see

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
at some of these lines here we can see

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.709 
at some of these lines here we can see
that<00:05:28.069> they're<00:05:28.219> still<00:05:28.580> not<00:05:28.909> straight<00:05:29.389> and<00:05:29.419> so

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
that they're still not straight and so

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.029 
that they're still not straight and so
this<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:29.990> something<00:05:30.289> we<00:05:30.409> could<00:05:30.529> do<00:05:30.710> now<00:05:30.889> in

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039

this is something we could do now in
Photoshop<00:05:31.580> cs6<00:05:31.969> but<00:05:32.539> I<00:05:32.569> couldn't<00:05:32.930> do<00:05:33.020> in
