00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello how about youtube friends here in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 a new video enlarged for you here 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.940
 I bring you the tutorial to make a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.660
 invisible ceiling in gil 4 in the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 modality of force well first of all 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.820
 here I have my little room I had made for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.650
 that they see and here in the middle I am going to put a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 block so they see that you can not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 leave this area once we put 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.570
 the invisible ceiling 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.270
 here I'm going to place the painting I'm going to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.310
 put in between 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.830
 my room is small you can 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.270
 make the size that you want 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.480
 it can be an adventure map or what 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.820
 be fine once we have our 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.860
 map made to make visible tension 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.150
 we'll have to go where it says 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 gadgets and we're going to feature zone 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.010
 this area of â€‹â€‹features will allow us to do 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.980
 an invisible ceiling as you see here I'm going 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.950
 to put in the middle so that it is as if 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.460
 outside the roof and I put it and if you guys 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.560
 they want want it to be bigger 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 they have to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.579
 you have to give x the object of this and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.159
 where it says radio there is more increase 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.369
 bigger is I preferably I'll 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.979
 put in 2.5 because it's not very big 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.619
 the place that I have once all 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.500
 this we are going to pause then we are going to 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.280
 feature zone properties we are going to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 alpha traits and let's move here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 in speed the player has to be 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.420
 in 0% gravity of the player 200 per 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.630
 100 percent jump height and 100 percent 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.909
 this is all we have to have 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 well exactly as I have it and that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.939
 it would be all right here we would have done 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.790
 our invisible ceiling as you see here 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.070
 I have the rocket backpack for 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.530
 for you to see that you can not 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.410
 continue to test and look how they see is how 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.040
 if it were a roof because it bounced 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.040
 down 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.319
 and so that you are sure that 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.470
 I'm not doing any tricks or anything 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.970
 I'm going to remove the object this and now I'm going 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.970
 to let go with the rocket backpack 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.200
 as you see now if I can leave because 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.880
 the invisible ceiling already works I hope 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.190
 you liked this video and here I 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.190
 dismissal of any ex out
