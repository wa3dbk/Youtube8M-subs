00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello online store out of frame 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.690
 represents the phone armored 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 which is called jeep z6 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.210
 Well , according to the stated parameters, jack for 6 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 we have ip 68 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.600
 Well, judging by the body and the cover specifically 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.000
 Here I opened I doubt that this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 The phone has an ip 68 since there is no 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.550
 no gasket is enough 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 everything is soft 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.219
 silicone to close it all neatly 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.710
 and beautiful as well, in principle, made very 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.480
 nice comfortable size nice 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 material 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.820
 one feels that everything is enough here 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.739
 tight no gaps all good battery 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.910
 on 2 with you thousands of milliamps 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.399
 said that the 8-megapixel camera on the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.559
 picking equipment is very strange 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.680
 but maybe it's like 1 delivery 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.260
 instead of the key is a coin and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.719
 Ukraine coin 5 kopecks was somewhere 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.400
 charger from iphone for some reason 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.010
 walks to him i think it's not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.409
 fundamentally cable chargers with 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.619
 elongation of the same elongated plug as on 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:21.680
 any armored car has such a compass 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 compass even works compass working 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.799
 that's what's coming now 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.140
 try to close 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.040
 well what is the camera 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 elements of this phone are generally by 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.000
 price category it corresponds 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.350
 holmer have already 5+ and discovery you 6 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 phone and something closer to the landrover at a8 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.250
 In principle, this is how competitors 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 each other phones and they will 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 compete which is cheaper which is more expensive but 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.479
 closed tight enough once not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.930
 got water like silicone so 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.020
 there is no payment of gaskets 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.850
 Further the display quality is bright enough 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.190
 as you can see there is a fucking steve key 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.850
 display 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.679
 usually these phones and do not put another 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.420
 the phone is Russified there is a little bit 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.870
 Chinese applications that are easy 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.110
 cleaned usually pinch it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:23.600
 transfer remove quarrels clamp remove 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.000
 it is now retire us here now 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.410
 like this either through the application menu you need 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.150
 do this here remove how 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.980
 we no longer have this chinese 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.810
 applications chinese navigator but 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.260
 Russian Thai navigator us here 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.989
 there is a dps that's what we look at now 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.120
 still the Chinese application do not like ours 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.580
 People Chinese applications 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.620
 how is this cleaned up here hla app i 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.570
 I would not remove the application after all fly 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.709
 can be controlled by languages 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.110
 then be problems with youtube languages 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.880
 if you do not like everything else 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.459
 completely Russified let's go 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 We see Wi-Fi and bluetooth settings 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.769
 we have both wifi and bluetooth to gps 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 screen rotation 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.440
 phone memory phone memory 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.130
 represents 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.580
 127 132 that is, it is together three giants with 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.459
 4 gigabytes of memory built-in 512 RAM 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.389
 channel processors 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.090
 82 android 4 2 2 model is called a jeep 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.180
 Well, Jack is probably connected with his 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.329
 design is somewhat reminiscent of jeep grand 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.340
 cherokee 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:50.280
 camera camera of this phone camera 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:55.590
 This phone has both front and back 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.829
 on technical parameters that's what pleases 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:04.049
 I already see that the camera is better here 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:07.530
 than what blender 8 is uniquely here 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:14.449
 the camera is better than hummer h5 and more 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.449
 discovery at 6 but worse of course than I am there 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.610
 compete with something you see everything 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.730
 modelki they are somehow different in 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.290
 one plus the table is another -100 and so on 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.960
 that is, you can't say which one 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:36.270
 better, well, that's the principle 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 phone comfortable pleasant to the touch 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.530
 I do not see a pretty good one 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.980
 any serious problems well sure 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.710
 more than that the 68 in this phone is 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.970
 Wrong most likely 10 67 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.810
 Well, still an interesting picture of our drawing 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.490
 car UAZ Bobby who so 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.010
 called him the people 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:11.010
 they jack on neji help jeep jeep a 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:13.110
 sketched here uazik what is good 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.820
 model available 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.820
 I think it will work
