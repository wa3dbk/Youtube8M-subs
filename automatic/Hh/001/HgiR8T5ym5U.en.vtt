you put putting a sock it just it's

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.980 
you put putting a sock it just it's
easier<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.520> faster<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.390> since<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.750> it<00:01:16.869> old

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
easier and faster and since that it old

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.960 
easier and faster and since that it old
its<00:01:17.170> video<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.500> be<00:01:17.619> like<00:01:17.770> five<00:01:18.100> hours<00:01:18.130> long<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
its video to be like five hours long I

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
its video to be like five hours long I
think<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.740> take<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.490> then<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.240> grab

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
think so you take this and then you grab

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.780 
think so you take this and then you grab
your<00:01:23.020> ponytail<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.040> then<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.310> flip<00:01:24.640> it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
your ponytail and then you flip it

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.499 
your ponytail and then you flip it
inside<00:01:24.940> out

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
inside out

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.590 
inside out
and<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.340> although<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.850> ponytail<00:01:28.270> hairs<00:01:28.479> in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
and so although the ponytail hairs in

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.010 
and so although the ponytail hairs in
there<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:29.729> bring<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.850> around<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.570> top<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.930> your

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
there you bring it around on top of your

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.600 
there you bring it around on top of your
head

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:53.750 

kind<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.700> weird<00:01:38.230> but<00:01:39.230> you're<00:01:39.950> playing

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.220 

and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.420> some<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> them<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.050> little

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
and then some of them have a little

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.440 
and then some of them have a little
comes<00:01:55.650> up<00:01:56.040> front<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.760> back<00:01:56.910> door<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
comes up front at the back door in the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.560 
comes up front at the back door in the
back

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 

this<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.380> doesn't<00:02:01.800> really<00:02:01.980> compare<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this one doesn't really compare to the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.920 
this one doesn't really compare to the
shirt<00:02:03.120> I'm<00:02:03.240> wearing<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.780> why<00:02:03.900> I
