00:00:01.297 --> 00:00:03.144
Now that we've finished our game we need to

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:04.851
present it to our players.

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:07.088
One of the greatest things about Unity is that

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:09.380
once we have created our game we can deploy

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.380
it to many of the current platforms.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.880
For more detailed information on building and

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.684
build targets please see the lesson linked below.

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:19.294
Before we build our game we should

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:20.779
save our scene.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.779
To build our game we must first open

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.779
the Build Settings window.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.083
We can do this by selecting File - Build Settings

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:30.789
or by using the key combination of

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.949
shift plus command or control plus B.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:38.763
This brings up the Build Settings window.

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:42.180
Our current build target is indicated by the Unity logo.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180
The blue highlight indicates our focus and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.950
shows us on the right hand side the build

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.538
options for the currently selected platform.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.134
We want to build a standalone application.

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:56.774
This is our current build target.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:59.679
PC, Mac and Linux Standalone.

00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:02.998
We do not need to change our build target.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.861
If we did want to change our build target

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:08.488
we can select the desired platform from the list

00:01:08.488 --> 00:01:12.038
and click the Switch Platforms button at the bottom of the window.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.157
Let's now return our build target to the standalone player.

00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:22.427
Once we have selected our new build target

00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:24.648
we need to add the scenes we want to build

00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:26.648
to the Build Settings window.

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:28.965
We can add the current scene by clicking the

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:30.646
Add Current button.

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.646
Or we can drag and drop any scene from our

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:34.986
project view in to the field at the top of

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:36.475
the Build Settings window.

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.419
It's worth noting that we don't need to

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:42.655
include every scene in our project.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.185
We only need to include the scenes we

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:46.006
we want in our game.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.006
It is also possible to perform a build

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.477
with no scenes in the build Settings window.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.889
If we do this, Unity will simply build our game

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.611
using the current scene we have open for editing.

00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.577
Now we are ready to build our game.

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:02.383
Let's return to the Build Settings window

00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:04.217
and click the Build button.

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:06.217
This will bring up a dialogue box asking us

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.217
to choose a build location.

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.217
I like to associate my build location with

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:13.151
my project, so I will create a new folder

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.859
inside my project called Builds.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.827
This folder must be placed only on the

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.827
root of our project alongside the

00:02:21.827 --> 00:02:23.827
assets and library folders.

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.549
With the build folder selected let's name the build

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.190
and then click save.

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:35.467
Unity will now build the application

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.467
and save it to our Builds folder

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:42.442
When building for the Mac Unity builds a .app bundle,

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:45.380
which contains all of the relevant data and files.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.644
When building for Windows

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:51.041
Unity builds a .exe file

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:55.033
and a data folder which contains all of the necessary resources.

00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:01.462
To run the game, simply run the executable application.

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:07.203
And now we are running our game.

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:14.990
And, we win!

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:22.099
So in these assignments we have learned how to

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.385
create new game objects, how to position them in the scene,

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.658
add new components to them, write our own custom behaviours

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:30.658
for them using simple scripting.

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:32.824
We've seen how to use lights, cameras,

00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:35.179
colliders, triggers, rigid bodies.

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.427
We can collect and count objects.

00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:39.327
Though this is a very simple example,

00:03:39.327 --> 00:03:41.327
it covers a large set of basic

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:44.277
subjects important to understanding how to use Unity.

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:48.534
