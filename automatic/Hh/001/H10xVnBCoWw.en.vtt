00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
hey guys over the last few well probably

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.570 
hey guys over the last few well probably
a<00:00:08.420> year<00:00:09.020> and<00:00:09.170> a<00:00:09.200> half<00:00:09.320> or<00:00:09.950> as<00:00:10.129> long<00:00:10.340> as<00:00:10.460> the

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
a year and a half or as long as the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.549 
a year and a half or as long as the
brushless<00:00:10.760> motor<00:00:11.150> has<00:00:11.360> been<00:00:11.539> going<00:00:11.900> I've<00:00:12.500> been

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
brushless motor has been going I've been

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.129 
brushless motor has been going I've been
designing<00:00:12.949> a<00:00:13.369> making<00:00:13.789> or<00:00:13.969> at<00:00:14.150> least<00:00:14.330> creating

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
designing a making or at least creating

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.720 
designing a making or at least creating
these<00:00:15.230> for<00:00:15.440> clients<00:00:15.920> which<00:00:16.070> of<00:00:16.250> course<00:00:16.520> you'll

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
these for clients which of course you'll

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.930 
these for clients which of course you'll
all<00:00:16.850> recognize<00:00:17.029> as<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.040> brushless<00:00:19.040> 3<00:00:19.550> axis

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
all recognize as the brushless 3 axis

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.180 
all recognize as the brushless 3 axis
gimbal<00:00:20.180> be<00:00:20.720> it<00:00:20.840> for<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.110> multi<00:00:21.410> rotor<00:00:21.590> or<00:00:21.920> for

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
gimbal be it for the multi rotor or for

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.480 
gimbal be it for the multi rotor or for
the<00:00:22.250> handheld<00:00:23.410> so<00:00:24.410> I've<00:00:24.710> been<00:00:24.830> doing<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:25.190> and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
the handheld so I've been doing this and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.820 
the handheld so I've been doing this and
over<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.760> last<00:00:25.940> yeah<00:00:26.720> for<00:00:27.020> that<00:00:27.110> period<00:00:27.380> time

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
over the last yeah for that period time

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.680 
over the last yeah for that period time
I've<00:00:28.190> actually<00:00:28.370> found<00:00:28.850> that<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.300> feedback

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
I've actually found that the feedback

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.570 
I've actually found that the feedback
that<00:00:29.720> I've<00:00:29.930> got<00:00:30.140> is<00:00:30.500> depending<00:00:31.220> on<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> lens

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
that I've got is depending on the lens

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.910 
that I've got is depending on the lens
that<00:00:31.820> people<00:00:32.059> are<00:00:32.180> using<00:00:32.419> they<00:00:32.750> actually<00:00:33.170> find

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
that people are using they actually find

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.860 
that people are using they actually find
that<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.309> movement<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:35.030> course<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:35.450> takes<00:00:35.600> out

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
that the movement of course it takes out

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.350 
that the movement of course it takes out
the<00:00:36.050> X<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.920> y<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:37.700> it<00:00:37.790> doesn't<00:00:38.060> take<00:00:38.180> out

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
the X and the y but it doesn't take out

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.150 
the X and the y but it doesn't take out
the<00:00:38.510> z-axis<00:00:38.690> movement<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.770> takes<00:00:40.010> out

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
the z-axis movement it takes out

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.740 
the z-axis movement it takes out
obviously<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.640> rotation<00:00:41.239> but<00:00:41.450> not<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
obviously the rotation but not the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.470 
obviously the rotation but not the
up-and-down<00:00:42.220> so<00:00:43.220> for<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.820> last<00:00:43.940> few<00:00:44.180> months

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
up-and-down so for the last few months

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.970 
up-and-down so for the last few months
I've<00:00:44.600> been<00:00:44.750> developing<00:00:44.989> something<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:45.739> has

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
I've been developing something that has

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.580 
I've been developing something that has
been<00:00:46.160> mixing<00:00:46.940> two<00:00:47.329> forms<00:00:47.899> of<00:00:48.050> technology

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
been mixing two forms of technology

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.389 
been mixing two forms of technology
which<00:00:49.309> of<00:00:49.460> course<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.790> will<00:00:50.030> recognize<00:00:50.510> this

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
which of course you will recognize this

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.200 
which of course you will recognize this
which<00:00:52.399> is<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.820> type<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:54.460> Steadicam<00:00:55.460> rig<00:00:55.820> which

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
which is a type of Steadicam rig which

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.990 
which is a type of Steadicam rig which
of<00:00:56.360> course<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.690> can<00:00:56.840> see<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.110> two<00:00:57.290> arms<00:00:57.680> that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
of course you can see the two arms that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.030 
of course you can see the two arms that
compensate<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.899> you<00:00:59.989> wear<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.290> jacket<00:01:00.440> which

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
compensate that you wear a jacket which

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.770 
compensate that you wear a jacket which
causes<00:01:01.430> big<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.760> cumbersome<00:01:02.239> no<00:01:02.450> one<00:01:02.570> likes

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
causes big and cumbersome no one likes

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.959 
causes big and cumbersome no one likes
using<00:01:03.110> them<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.159> course<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.460> mix<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.790> two

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
using them so of course the mix the two

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.889 
using them so of course the mix the two
together<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.860> created<00:01:07.600> what<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.630> would

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
together and created what I would

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.649 
together and created what I would
probably<00:01:09.139> hope<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.740> say<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.399> first<00:01:10.850> 4xs

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
probably hope and say is the first 4xs

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.160 
probably hope and say is the first 4xs
gimbal<00:01:12.579> you<00:01:13.579> can<00:01:13.729> see<00:01:13.939> here<00:01:14.209> just<00:01:14.749> a<00:01:14.840> handheld

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
gimbal you can see here just a handheld

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.889 
gimbal you can see here just a handheld
you<00:01:15.409> can<00:01:15.530> put<00:01:15.649> it<00:01:15.709> on<00:01:15.799> your<00:01:15.859> shoulder<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:17.780> do

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
you can put it on your shoulder you do

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:18.690 
you can put it on your shoulder you do
whatever<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.229> want<00:01:18.289> with<00:01:18.529> it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
whatever you want with it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.309 
whatever you want with it
I<00:01:19.700> think<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:20.389> the<00:01:20.479> first<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.869> haven't<00:01:21.139> seen

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
I think it's the first I haven't seen

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.319 
I think it's the first I haven't seen
another<00:01:21.529> four<00:01:22.100> axis<00:01:22.490> gimbal<00:01:22.670> out<00:01:22.939> there<00:01:23.149> but

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
another four axis gimbal out there but

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.059 
another four axis gimbal out there but
this<00:01:23.420> compensates<00:01:24.310> for<00:01:26.020> movement<00:01:27.020> if<00:01:27.859> you're

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
this compensates for movement if you're

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.609 
this compensates for movement if you're
running<00:01:28.279> for<00:01:29.179> example<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.899> depending<00:01:30.529> what

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
running for example and depending what

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.469 
running for example and depending what
you're<00:01:30.770> doing<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:31.189> I<00:01:32.060> haven't<00:01:32.299> got<00:01:32.389> the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
you're doing and I haven't got the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.999 
you're doing and I haven't got the
actual<00:01:32.749> gimbal<00:01:33.079> itself<00:01:33.439> working<00:01:33.859> at<00:01:33.950> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
actual gimbal itself working at the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.179 
actual gimbal itself working at the
moment<00:01:34.159> it's<00:01:34.849> just<00:01:35.060> fixed<00:01:35.679> but<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:36.799> can<00:01:36.950> see

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
moment it's just fixed but you can see

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.209 
moment it's just fixed but you can see
see<00:01:37.999> the<00:01:38.119> movement<00:01:38.539> there<00:01:41.709> so<00:01:42.709> yep<00:01:42.950> just

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
see the movement there so yep just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.989 
see the movement there so yep just
moving<00:01:43.579> up<00:01:43.639> and<00:01:43.819> down<00:01:43.909> any<00:01:44.599> vibrations<00:01:45.409> just

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
moving up and down any vibrations just

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.510 
moving up and down any vibrations just
compensates<00:01:46.999> for<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.829> so<00:01:48.829> yes<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.189> thought<00:01:49.399> I'd

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
compensates for it so yes I thought I'd

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.649 
compensates for it so yes I thought I'd
show<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.789> this<00:01:50.029> and<00:01:50.770> hope<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.919> like<00:01:52.099> it<00:01:52.310> I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
show you this and hope you like it I

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.489 
show you this and hope you like it I
don't<00:01:53.659> know<00:01:53.929> if<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:54.109> going<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.289> go<00:01:54.380> into

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
don't know if we're going to go into

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.730 
don't know if we're going to go into
production<00:01:55.479> but<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:56.749> will<00:01:56.929> he<00:01:57.049> notice<00:01:57.380> through

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
production but so will he notice through

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.449 
production but so will he notice through
motorized<00:01:58.459> drone<00:01:58.999> tuna<00:01:59.569> and<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.529> robotics<00:02:01.039> code

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
motorized drone tuna and a robotics code

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.300 
motorized drone tuna and a robotics code
at<00:02:01.579> UK<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.319> we<00:02:03.319> work<00:02:03.499> together<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.069> create

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
at UK and we work together and create
