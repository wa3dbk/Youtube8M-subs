00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to all san giovanni today we will see 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.930
 fast progress of fai nuxis 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.630
 that we tried to recover 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.400
 together in the last video 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.679
 so what you see here what 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.350
 improvised that I simply did 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.330
 to hang the orchid because in the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 shelf where I keep it all now 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.970
 there is more useful space and in any case the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 plant is ok and is recovering 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 Feverishly then recovery is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 was done two months ago and just the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 days the temperatures improved 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.550
 the plant started up a little 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.950
 to respond is also wonderfully 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 if in the meantime a person leaf one 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 root then here as you can see 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 we have three very small new roots e 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.989
 there is also another never behind not you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.750
 sees 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.300
 and then a new escape I'm sure 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.690
 at the end of summer this phalenopsis 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.289
 it will have recovered wonderfully and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 why not maybe it can flourish again 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.910
 we cross our fingers anyway as I have you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.100
 said in the video on which however there is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 I advise going to see if still 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 you have not seen it or simply 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.850
 watering the orchid standing on the edge 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 of the vase as he had advised me 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.200
 lorena who thanks once again 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.590
 thank you so much 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 no, so I'm holding it in one place 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.430
 hot 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 let's say it's bright enough remember 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.049
 that the phalenopsis and never must 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.820
 stay on the direct however now there 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.490
 I show how close I am 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.119
 beautiful in these new roots , here they are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.909
 here they are not beautiful I do not know why 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.850
 but 9 new foliage roots make it more 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.100
 happy that seeing new styles will be stupid 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 I don't know anyway then we also have 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 this year's leaf talking is in 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.450
 this video 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.869
 you are also seeing let's say new roots 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.459
 that you are just developing and if you are 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.979
 remember the video on the difference between 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.679
 radicella stars I had not done 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.709
 see roots so let's say a little 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.780
 I push you into growth anyway 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.090
 the link at the end of the video is how we have 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.819
 recovered this orchid which is that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 on the difference between root stars if 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.110
 these beautiful new roots are me 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.489
 liked and want to continue to see the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.620
 video on orchids 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.790
 don't forget to join the channel 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.410
 and to raise the thumb 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.410
 see you at the next video
