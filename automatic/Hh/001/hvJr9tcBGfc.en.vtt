00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.899
 Yesterday on Thursday it was announced that Arjen Robben might be from Real 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.559
 Madrid would switch to Bayern Munich today on Friday before a few 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.179
 Minutes, the contract was actually signed and a few minutes later 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.400
 after signing here you can log in the Dutch 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.169
 National player in our studio in the us in the FCB 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.630
 Attract CV 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.439
 last played at Real Madrid they have to match 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.309
 Too perfect Spanish before Chelsea was in London almost speaks 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.570
 Perfect English Dutch only with German are not quite so 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.829
 Well that's why we decided the interview read the interview 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.810
 satisfied with the business 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.110
 at the World Cup tournaments Network 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.450
 also in the coming 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 Shocked the rail of this transfer region but very quickly across the stage 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.790
 It was really such a fast development the couple did 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.170
 RP is fast to 4 8 percent 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.770
 our software 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 "Of course it was hard for me a very hectic week for me 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.700
 he leads September I had to learn more about some things 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.100
 Finally, I decided to go with this copying 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520
 to play this great club 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.290
 but everything died very quickly and it was known also gasoline 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.110
 That's what one of the world's best offensive midfielders will be for 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.520
 probably to move 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.090
 October was a can against why one percent turns specifically from the first 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.130
 Contact then I had a very poor sentiment Bayern Munich Mio 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.399
 Immediately I felt well and welcome my dad was here one has one 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.570
 also very good percent 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.840
 Muchacho's progress in Munich he was immediately convinced that this 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 the right step for me is and it has evaporated and as I said it is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.400
 one from there flew with a great story and i am very glad that 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.380
 I wrote them
