00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.230 

and<00:02:04.430> now<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> turn<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.030> other

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and now I'm going to turn on the other

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.219 
and now I'm going to turn on the other
light<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.950> other<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.720> 160<00:02:09.720> lumens<00:02:10.140> i

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
light the other one is 160 lumens i

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.400 
light the other one is 160 lumens i
think<00:02:10.730> it<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:16.350> thrust<00:02:16.620> fire<00:02:16.950> f20<00:02:17.880> light<00:02:18.410> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
think it is the thrust fire f20 light so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.220 
think it is the thrust fire f20 light so
when<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.709> turn<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.880> looks<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.270 
you can see the spot right in the red
tail<00:02:28.459> light<00:02:31.209> that's<00:02:32.209> nice<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.769> all<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.129> is

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
tail light that's nice this all this is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.470 
tail light that's nice this all this is
strong<00:02:34.909> after<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:38.569> mini<00:02:39.849> mini<00:02:40.849> flashlight

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
strong after this mini mini flashlight

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:53.530 
strong after this mini mini flashlight
from<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.170> extreme<00:02:42.500> also

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.619 

so<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:54.709> most<00:02:55.340> strongest<00:02:55.969> bike<00:02:56.360> light

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
switch this off and I can compare it to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.550 
switch this off and I can compare it to
the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.960 

p7<00:03:09.560> make<00:03:10.220> shine<00:03:10.720> bike<00:03:11.720> lights<00:03:14.140> it's<00:03:15.140> going<00:03:15.440> to

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
p7 make shine bike lights it's going to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.470 
p7 make shine bike lights it's going to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
switch the lamps

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:36.650 
switch the lamps
take<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.260> other<00:03:20.290> one<00:03:20.560> out<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.190> my<00:03:21.400> pockets

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.720 

now<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.780> going<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.110> turn<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.350> on<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:39.550> is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
now I'm going to turn that on this is

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.600 
now I'm going to turn that on this is
the<00:03:40.000> p7<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:42.060> bike<00:03:43.060> light<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:45.100> that's<00:03:45.310> the

the p7 and bike light so that's the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.120 
the p7 and bike light so that's the
different<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.720> think<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.470> see<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:47.920> very

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
different I think I see this is very

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
different I think I see this is very
strong<00:03:48.550> and<00:03:50.880> what<00:03:51.880> other<00:03:52.030> one<00:03:52.240> is<00:03:52.420> for<00:03:53.320> most

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
strong and what other one is for most

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.200 
strong and what other one is for most
strongest<00:03:55.810> tail<00:03:56.080> like<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.560> ever<00:03:57.340> got<00:03:58.300> so

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
strongest tail like that I ever got so

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.730 
strongest tail like that I ever got so
just<00:04:01.210> a<00:04:01.420> little<00:04:02.820> small<00:04:03.820> test<00:04:04.180> now<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.380> know

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
just a little small test now you know

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.460
