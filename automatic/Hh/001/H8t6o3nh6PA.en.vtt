00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.490 
I guess I have another prediction and
that<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.760> maybe<00:04:05.760> damien<00:04:06.269> mizdow<00:04:06.500> replacing

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that is maybe damien mizdow replacing

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.710 
that is maybe damien mizdow replacing
the<00:04:08.040> maze<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.519> matchup<00:04:08.760> they<00:04:09.510> could

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
the maze in this matchup they could

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.479 
the maze in this matchup they could
definitely<00:04:09.959> bring<00:04:10.290> up<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.560> win<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.769> Raw<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489

for him but you know assuming it's just

Sheamus the versus the Miz I'm fully

Sheamus the versus the Miz I'm fully
expecting<00:04:30.530> Sheamus<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.830> retain<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.760> title

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.960 
here I don't see them is well you know I
think<00:04:37.380> there's<00:04:37.680> there's<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.250> possibility

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
think there's there's a possibility

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.719 
think there's there's a possibility
there<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.780> maybe<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.620> Miz<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.220> know<00:04:41.340> wins

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
there that maybe the Miz you know wins

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.330 
there that maybe the Miz you know wins
the<00:04:41.940> title<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.330> mean<00:04:42.540> after<00:04:42.660> all<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:43.340> didn't

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
the title I mean after all I didn't

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.700 
the title I mean after all I didn't
expect<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.389> MS<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.870> win<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.320> championship

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
expect the MS to win the championship

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.879 
expect the MS to win the championship

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
didn't rule it out completely it just

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.830 
didn't rule it out completely it just
didn't<00:04:52.740> seem<00:04:52.860> very<00:04:52.919> likely<00:04:53.400> but<00:04:53.910> hey<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.630> maze

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
didn't seem very likely but hey the maze

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.010 
didn't seem very likely but hey the maze
when<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.650> title<00:04:56.010> off<00:04:56.220> of<00:04:56.850> Dolph<00:04:57.630> Ziggler<00:04:57.660> at

when the title off of Dolph Ziggler at
SummerSlam<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.370> didn't<00:04:59.580> expect<00:04:59.669> him<00:04:59.970> to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
SummerSlam and I didn't expect him to

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.409 
SummerSlam and I didn't expect him to
lose<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.360> title<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:02.090> what<00:05:03.090> was<00:05:03.240> it

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
lose the title at what was it

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.870 
lose the title at what was it
battleground<00:05:03.930> or<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:05.070> pay-per-view<00:05:05.400> before

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
battleground or the pay-per-view before

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.879 
battleground or the pay-per-view before
SummerSlam<00:05:06.570> where<00:05:07.229> he<00:05:07.320> lost<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.620> title<00:05:07.860> to

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
SummerSlam where he lost the title to

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.230 
SummerSlam where he lost the title to
Dolph<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.340> didn't<00:05:08.520> expect<00:05:08.789> him<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:08.940> lose<00:05:09.120> the

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
Dolph I didn't expect him to lose the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.520 
Dolph I didn't expect him to lose the
title<00:05:09.539> that<00:05:09.630> soon<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.199> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
title that soon to you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.340 
title that soon to you
it's<00:05:11.039> Dolph<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.610> he<00:05:11.940> did<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:13.169> know<00:05:13.289> I'm

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
it's Dolph and he did so you know I'm

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.310 
it's Dolph and he did so you know I'm
not<00:05:13.530> gonna<00:05:13.800> rule<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.100> out<00:05:14.280> completely<00:05:15.320> Miz

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
not gonna rule it out completely Miz

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.560 
not gonna rule it out completely Miz
could<00:05:16.830> win<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> championship<00:05:17.850> but<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.270> think

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
could win the championship but I think

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.260 
could win the championship but I think
Sheamus<00:05:19.320> chances<00:05:19.949> here<00:05:20.130> are<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.430> lot<00:05:20.940> stronger

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
Sheamus chances here are a lot stronger

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.200 
Sheamus chances here are a lot stronger
and<00:05:21.979> part<00:05:22.979> of<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.820> know<00:05:23.910> part<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.120> the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
and part of that you know part of the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.510 
and part of that you know part of the
reasoning<00:05:24.510> behind<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.370> right<00:05:26.370> now<00:05:26.490> I

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
reasoning behind that is right now I

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.839 
reasoning behind that is right now I
could<00:05:26.789> actually<00:05:26.910> see<00:05:27.590> Sheamus<00:05:28.849> eventually

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
could actually see Sheamus eventually

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.310 
could actually see Sheamus eventually
defending<00:05:30.479> his<00:05:30.780> US<00:05:31.080> title<00:05:31.349> against<00:05:32.039> rusev<00:05:32.849> and

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
defending his US title against rusev and

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.900 
defending his US title against rusev and
I'd<00:05:34.320> be<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.770> look<00:05:35.070> forward<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.580> program

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
I'd be I look forward to that program

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.180 
I'd be I look forward to that program
I'd<00:05:36.240> like<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.570> see<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:36.870> I'd<00:05:37.800> like<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.070> see

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
I'd like to see that I'd like to see

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.450 
I'd like to see that I'd like to see
Sheamus<00:05:38.639> versus<00:05:39.030> rusev<00:05:39.510> and<00:05:39.770> I<00:05:40.770> like<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.310> see

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
Sheamus versus rusev and I like to see

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.310 
Sheamus versus rusev and I like to see
rusev<00:05:42.030> win<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.690> United<00:05:42.840> States<00:05:43.080> Championship

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
rusev win the United States Championship

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.980 
rusev win the United States Championship
and<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.580> course<00:05:44.820> if<00:05:45.000> he<00:05:45.090> does<00:05:45.300> challenge<00:05:45.780> for

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
and of course if he does challenge for

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.480 
and of course if he does challenge for
the<00:05:46.050> US<00:05:46.260> Championship<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.070> definitely<00:05:47.400> think

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
the US Championship I definitely think

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.820 
the US Championship I definitely think
Sheamus<00:05:47.880> is<00:05:48.270> gonna<00:05:48.930> be<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.380> defending

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
Sheamus is gonna be the defending

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.659 
Sheamus is gonna be the defending
champion<00:05:50.400> not<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.300> Miss<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:53.130> know<00:05:53.220> going

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
champion not the Miss so you know going

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.790 
champion not the Miss so you know going
back<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:54.150> my<00:05:54.240> prediction<00:05:54.840> when<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.620> comes<00:05:55.740> to

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
back to my prediction when it comes to

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.420 
back to my prediction when it comes to
this<00:05:55.919> match

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
this match

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.520 
this match
definitely<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.570> thinking<00:05:57.870> with<00:05:58.050> Sheamus

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
definitely it's thinking with Sheamus

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.689 
definitely it's thinking with Sheamus
that's<00:05:58.770> my<00:05:59.220> pick

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
that's my pick

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.210 
that's my pick
so<00:06:00.000> anyways<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:00.720> hope<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.930> guys<00:06:01.050> enjoyed<00:06:01.979> this
