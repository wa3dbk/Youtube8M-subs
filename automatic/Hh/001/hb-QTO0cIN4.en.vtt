00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
for your USB your data files so if you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
have a USB 3 stick or a drive plug it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.230 
have a USB 3 stick or a drive plug it
into<00:02:21.600> here<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.950> stream<00:02:23.190> HD<00:02:23.520> over

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240

here and transfer your files around

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.790 
here and transfer your files around
faster<00:02:26.010> better<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> use<00:02:27.180> USB<00:02:27.480> 2<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.140> printing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
faster better to use USB 2 for printing

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520 
faster better to use USB 2 for printing
but<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> wish<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.570> swap<00:02:31.320> them<00:02:31.470> around

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
but if you wish you can swap them around
