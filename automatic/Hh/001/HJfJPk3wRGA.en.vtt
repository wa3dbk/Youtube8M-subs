one<00:00:19.210> thing<00:00:19.510> that<00:00:19.540> I<00:00:19.690> noticed<00:00:20.200> right<00:00:20.320> off<00:00:20.470> the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
one thing that I noticed right off the

one thing that I noticed right off the
bat<00:00:20.950> I<00:00:21.880> was<00:00:22.689> using<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:23.080> blue<00:00:23.290> lipo<00:00:23.710> before<00:00:24.540> the

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
bat I was using a blue lipo before the

bat I was using a blue lipo before the
big<00:00:26.110> difference<00:00:26.619> is<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:27.099> dimensions<00:00:27.759> of<00:00:27.820> the

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
big difference is the dimensions of the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.260 
big difference is the dimensions of the
battery<00:00:28.240> packs<00:00:28.540> are<00:00:28.869> very<00:00:29.500> different<00:00:30.460> the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
battery packs are very different the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.290 
battery packs are very different the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
thinner pack is also much wider where

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.210

the skylight boat is a little bit more

but<00:00:57.399> certainly<00:00:58.210> very<00:00:59.170> comparable<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.969> if<00:01:01.090> you

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
but certainly very comparable so if you

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
rc10 car here that the blue lipo is just

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.920 
rc10 car here that the blue lipo is just
too<00:01:17.470> long<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.130> won't<00:01:18.970> quite<00:01:19.270> fit<00:01:19.600> into<00:01:19.750> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
too long and won't quite fit into the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.740 
too long and won't quite fit into the
tray<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:22.830> skylight<00:01:23.830> though<00:01:24.420> fits<00:01:25.420> in

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
tray and the skylight though fits in

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.590 
tray and the skylight though fits in
there<00:01:25.900> just<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.350> glove<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.510> something<00:01:28.510> to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
there just like a glove so something to

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.870 
there just like a glove so something to
consider<00:01:28.720> when<00:01:29.080> you're<00:01:29.380> shopping<00:01:29.590> for<00:01:29.880> for

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
consider when you're shopping for for

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.340 
consider when you're shopping for for
the<00:01:30.970> battery<00:01:31.299> for<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.630> new<00:01:31.750> lithium<00:01:32.229> polymer

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the battery for the new lithium polymer

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.149 
the battery for the new lithium polymer
batteries<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.450> blue<00:01:34.630> lipo<00:01:35.049> because<00:01:35.799> it's<00:01:36.009> so

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
batteries the blue lipo because it's so

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.260 
batteries the blue lipo because it's so
thin<00:01:36.659> though<00:01:37.659> if<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.500> have<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:39.220> car<00:01:40.000> here

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
thin though if you have a a car here

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.990 
thin though if you have a a car here
like<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.600> Duratrax<00:01:41.049> later<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:42.280> can<00:01:42.430> see<00:01:42.700> here

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
like the Duratrax later you can see here

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.649 
like the Duratrax later you can see here
that<00:01:43.030> with<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.329> to<00:01:43.540> sell<00:01:43.810> pack<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.299> flat

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
that with a to sell pack it's so flat

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.350 
that with a to sell pack it's so flat
that<00:01:47.020> there's<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.680> lot<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.310> extra<00:01:48.820> room<00:01:48.850> there

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
that there's a lot of extra room there

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.789 
that there's a lot of extra room there
to<00:01:49.600> fit<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.990> battery<00:01:50.290> tray<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.590> which

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
to fit in the battery tray of which

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.859 
to fit in the battery tray of which
makes<00:01:51.400> me<00:01:51.549> believe<00:01:51.579> you<00:01:52.030> could<00:01:52.180> probably<00:01:52.420> fit

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
makes me believe you could probably fit

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.580 
makes me believe you could probably fit
a<00:01:52.900> 3<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.740> 3<00:01:53.860> cell<00:01:54.460> pack<00:01:55.049> lipo<00:01:56.049> pack<00:01:56.259> in<00:01:56.500> a

fit<00:02:02.259> now<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.530> haven't<00:02:03.009> actually<00:02:03.220> confirmed

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
fit now I haven't actually confirmed

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.410 
fit now I haven't actually confirmed
this<00:02:04.030> but<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.409> skylight<00:02:05.829> go<00:02:06.240> certainly<00:02:07.240> fits

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
this but the skylight go certainly fits

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.660 
this but the skylight go certainly fits
in<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.630> evader<00:02:07.869> just<00:02:08.170> fine<00:02:08.380> both<00:02:09.369> battery

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
in the evader just fine both battery

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.789 
in the evader just fine both battery
packs<00:02:09.910> are<00:02:10.269> all<00:02:10.479> three<00:02:10.810> battery<00:02:11.140> pack<00:02:11.620> in

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
packs are all three battery pack in

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.060 
packs are all three battery pack in
the<00:02:11.950> later<00:02:12.519> just<00:02:12.820> fine<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.890> anyway<00:02:14.890> just

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
the later just fine so anyway just

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.039 
the later just fine so anyway just
something<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> consider<00:02:15.579> when<00:02:16.180> shopping<00:02:16.420> i

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
something to consider when shopping i

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.319 
something to consider when shopping i
also<00:02:17.230> want<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.590> note<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.829> it<00:02:18.670> seems<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.120> all

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
also want to note that it seems that all

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.840 
also want to note that it seems that all
the<00:02:19.510> batteries<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:20.230> ship<00:02:20.530> from<00:02:20.860> Hobby<00:02:21.430> parts

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the batteries that ship from Hobby parts

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.070 
the batteries that ship from Hobby parts
come<00:02:22.150> with<00:02:22.360> these<00:02:22.569> bananas<00:02:23.440> style<00:02:23.890> connectors

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080
