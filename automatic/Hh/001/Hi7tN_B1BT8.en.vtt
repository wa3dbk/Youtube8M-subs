00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
made in the physics department which

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
made in the physics department which
might<00:00:14.820> find<00:00:15.089> its<00:00:15.240> way<00:00:15.360> floating<00:00:16.020> down<00:00:16.199> a

we've<00:00:27.840> got<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.050> hoverboard

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
we've got a hoverboard

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.770 
we've got a hoverboard
here<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:30.619> is<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:31.070> tiny<00:00:31.760> lump<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.119> superconductor

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
here it is a tiny lump of superconductor

here it is a tiny lump of superconductor
cooled<00:00:33.559> down<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.980> almost<00:00:34.309> minus<00:00:34.790> 200<00:00:35.329> degrees

cooled down to almost minus 200 degrees
shooting<00:00:36.649> around<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:36.950> track<00:00:37.190> made<00:00:37.579> of

shooting around a track made of
extremely<00:00:38.420> strong<00:00:38.720> magnets<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:40.430> only<00:00:40.640> force

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
extremely strong magnets the only force

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.910 
extremely strong magnets the only force
slowing<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.329> down<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.780> air<00:00:41.989> resistance<00:00:42.290> which

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
slowing it down is air resistance which

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.410 
slowing it down is air resistance which
means<00:00:43.160> it<00:00:43.280> can<00:00:43.400> zoom<00:00:43.579> around<00:00:43.699> very<00:00:44.150> quickly

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
means it can zoom around very quickly

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.090 
means it can zoom around very quickly
for<00:00:44.690> quite<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> long<00:00:45.140> time<00:00:45.199> before<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:45.770> comes<00:00:45.830> to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
for quite a long time before it comes to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.369 
for quite a long time before it comes to
a<00:00:46.129> stop<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.839> how<00:00:48.589> does<00:00:48.650> that<00:00:48.800> work

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
a stop so how does that work

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.689 
a stop so how does that work
superconductors<00:00:51.379> are<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.530> strange<00:00:52.040> kind<00:00:52.460> of

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
superconductors are a strange kind of

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.759 
superconductors are a strange kind of

they're<00:00:55.160> usually<00:00:55.339> fairly<00:00:55.730> boring<00:00:56.089> either<00:00:56.449> a

they're usually fairly boring either a

they're usually fairly boring either a
regular<00:00:57.320> lump<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:57.769> metal<00:00:57.949> or<00:00:58.309> like<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.000> black

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
regular lump of metal or like this black

stuff ceramic rather like a tea cup or a
bathroom<00:01:02.510> tile<00:01:03.129> if<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:04.250> take<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.549> piece<00:01:04.760> of

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
bathroom tile if I take this piece of

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.340 
bathroom tile if I take this piece of
superconductor<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.690> put<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:05.990> near<00:01:06.140> these

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
superconductor and put it near these

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830 
extremely strong magnets
nothing<00:01:09.770> happens<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.330> reason<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.720> that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
nothing happens and the reason is that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.359 
nothing happens and the reason is that
all<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.080> superconductors<00:01:12.710> we<00:01:12.799> know<00:01:12.890> about<00:01:13.010> so

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
all the superconductors we know about so

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.030 
all the superconductors we know about so
far<00:01:13.640> only<00:01:13.970> work<00:01:14.479> if<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:15.020> cool<00:01:15.229> them<00:01:15.350> down<00:01:15.409> to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
far only work if we cool them down to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.969 
far only work if we cool them down to
extremely<00:01:16.640> low<00:01:16.939> temperatures<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:17.830> here<00:01:18.830> I've

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
extremely low temperatures so here I've

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.679 
extremely low temperatures so here I've
got<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.280> same<00:01:19.520> piece<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.970> super<00:01:20.150> conductor

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
got that same piece of super conductor

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.830 
got that same piece of super conductor
but<00:01:20.869> cooled<00:01:21.229> down<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.740> minus<00:01:22.280> 196<00:01:23.060> degrees<00:01:23.270> in

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
but cooled down to minus 196 degrees in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.070 
but cooled down to minus 196 degrees in
this<00:01:24.200> liquid<00:01:24.500> nitrogen<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.630> if<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.930> just

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
this liquid nitrogen so if I can just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.590 
this liquid nitrogen so if I can just
get<00:01:27.439> it<00:01:27.590> out<00:01:27.710> there<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:28.610> go<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:28.939> bring<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:29.479> near

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
get it out there we go and bring it near

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.710 
get it out there we go and bring it near
these<00:01:29.720> magnets<00:01:30.170> again<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:32.390> can<00:01:32.509> see

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
these magnets again you can see

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.440 
these magnets again you can see
something<00:01:33.380> rather<00:01:33.710> different<00:01:33.890> happens<00:01:34.549> it's

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
something rather different happens it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.209 
something rather different happens it's
just<00:01:35.630> floating<00:01:35.899> there<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.530> there's<00:01:37.100> no

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
just floating there and there's no

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.340 
just floating there and there's no
strings<00:01:37.579> I<00:01:37.850> can<00:01:38.359> pass<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.659> tweezers<00:01:38.960> above

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
strings I can pass the tweezers above

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.340 
strings I can pass the tweezers above
and<00:01:39.590> below<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:41.299> strange<00:01:41.689> property<00:01:42.140> is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and below this strange property is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.410 
and below this strange property is
called<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.829> Meissner<00:01:43.039> effect<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.329> only

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
called the Meissner effect and it only

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.090 
called the Meissner effect and it only
works<00:01:44.780> when<00:01:45.109> the<00:01:45.200> superconductor<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:45.950> nice

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
works when the superconductor is nice

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.309 
works when the superconductor is nice
and<00:01:46.310> cold<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.509> see<00:01:47.659> now<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.200> just

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
and cold so as you can see now it's just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.249 
and cold so as you can see now it's just
starting<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.710> warm<00:01:48.890> up<00:01:49.359> hum<00:01:50.359> and<00:01:50.929> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
starting to warm up hum and the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.809 
starting to warm up hum and the
superconductor<00:01:51.829> falls<00:01:52.100> back<00:01:52.549> onto<00:01:52.729> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
superconductor falls back onto the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.639 
superconductor falls back onto the
magnets<00:01:53.240> doing<00:01:53.569> absolutely<00:01:53.689> nothing<00:01:53.929> just

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
magnets doing absolutely nothing just

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.620 
magnets doing absolutely nothing just
like<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.890> was<00:01:54.979> before<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.579> boring<00:01:56.420> bit<00:01:56.539> of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
like it was before a boring bit of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.230 
like it was before a boring bit of
ceramic<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.520> reason<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.609> superconductor

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
ceramic the reason the superconductor

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.989 
ceramic the reason the superconductor
can<00:01:59.359> float<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.869> related<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.409> its<00:02:00.649> name<00:02:00.889> it<00:02:01.850> has

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
can float is related to its name it has

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.179 
can float is related to its name it has
absolutely<00:02:02.270> no<00:02:02.929> electrical<00:02:03.590> resistance<00:02:04.069> and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
absolutely no electrical resistance and

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.149 
absolutely no electrical resistance and
so<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.460> super<00:02:04.969> at<00:02:05.359> conducting<00:02:05.840> electricity

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
so it's super at conducting electricity

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.800 
so it's super at conducting electricity
if<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.939> think<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.149> an<00:02:08.240> ordinary<00:02:08.539> good

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
if you think of an ordinary good

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
if you think of an ordinary good
conductor<00:02:09.319> like<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.710> copper<00:02:10.069> that's<00:02:10.280> used<00:02:10.460> in

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
conductor like the copper that's used in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.240 
conductor like the copper that's used in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the wires inside your house does conduct

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.010 
the wires inside your house does conduct
electricity<00:02:13.580> quite<00:02:13.970> well<00:02:14.240> but<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
electricity quite well but the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.809 
electricity quite well but the
electricity<00:02:15.319> isn't<00:02:15.680> flowing<00:02:15.950> smoothly<00:02:16.490> like

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
electricity isn't flowing smoothly like

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.510 
electricity isn't flowing smoothly like
water<00:02:17.060> through<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> pipe<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.950> electrons<00:02:19.400> are

water through a pipe the electrons are

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.190 
water through a pipe the electrons are
bashing<00:02:19.730> into<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> copper<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.660> lose<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
bashing into the copper and lose the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.820 
bashing into the copper and lose the
energy<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.709> causing<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.280> copper<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.760> heat<00:02:22.940> up

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
energy and causing the copper to heat up

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.720 
energy and causing the copper to heat up
when<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> current<00:02:25.100> travels<00:02:25.580> through<00:02:25.700> a

smoothly without bashing into anything

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.870 
smoothly without bashing into anything
and<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.770> means<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.250> doesn't<00:02:31.459> lose<00:02:31.640> any

and that means that it doesn't lose any
energy<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.480> fact<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.709> start<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.069> current

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
same magnetic pole as the magnet is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.760 
same magnetic pole as the magnet is
brought<00:02:49.490> near<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.810> say<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.380> brought<00:02:51.560> near<00:02:51.740> a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.860 
brought near so say it's brought near a
north<00:02:52.040> pole<00:02:52.130> another<00:02:53.000> North<00:02:53.240> Pole<00:02:53.540> will<00:02:53.780> be

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
north pole another North Pole will be

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.500 
north pole another North Pole will be
set<00:02:54.080> up<00:02:54.230> inside<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.770> superconductor<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:56.330> acts

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
set up inside the superconductor it acts

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.110 
set up inside the superconductor it acts
a<00:02:56.720> bit<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> magnetic<00:02:57.440> mirror<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.940> two

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
a bit like a magnetic mirror the two

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.760 
a bit like a magnetic mirror the two
north<00:02:59.300> poles<00:02:59.569> repel<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.260> thus<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
north poles repel and thus the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.440 
north poles repel and thus the
superconductor<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.610> defy<00:03:01.850> gravity<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
superconductor can defy gravity and

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.900 
superconductor can defy gravity and
levitate<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:04.130> current<00:03:04.430> that's<00:03:04.520> keeping

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
levitate and the current that's keeping

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.910 
levitate and the current that's keeping
it<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.150> will<00:03:05.330> flow<00:03:05.630> forever<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:06.380> ever<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
it there will flow forever and ever so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.150 
it there will flow forever and ever so
it'll<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.430> keep<00:03:07.760> floating<00:03:08.170> well<00:03:09.170> until<00:03:10.069> it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
it'll just keep floating well until it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.850 
it'll just keep floating well until it
warms<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.489> at<00:03:10.640> least<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:12.380> could<00:03:12.590> use<00:03:12.739> this

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
warms up at least so we could use this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.979 
warms up at least so we could use this
effect<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.310> make<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:13.819> maglev<00:03:14.300> train<00:03:14.360> we<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:14.870> get

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
effect to make a maglev train we can get

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.479 
effect to make a maglev train we can get
the<00:03:15.080> superconductor<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.160> pop<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the superconductor and just pop it

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.910 
the superconductor and just pop it
straight<00:03:16.610> onto<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.060> track<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.500> sadly

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
straight onto the track but sadly

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.979 
straight onto the track but sadly
although<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.580> floats<00:03:19.820> nice<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.269> high<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
although it floats nice and high the

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.870 
although it floats nice and high the
Meissner<00:03:21.200> effect<00:03:21.410> only<00:03:21.950> repels<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
Meissner effect only repels the

Meissner effect only repels the
superconductor<00:03:23.450> different<00:03:23.690> magnets<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.200> so

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
superconductor different magnets and so

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.720 
superconductor different magnets and so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
what it's not very stable so actually

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.009 
what it's not very stable so actually
we're<00:03:31.910> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.060> cool<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.360> down<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.720> slightly

vertically<00:03:52.519> away<00:03:52.820> from<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:54.340> when<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
vertically away from it so when the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.270 
vertically away from it so when the
nitrogen<00:03:55.820> stops<00:03:56.060> boiling<00:03:58.480> we<00:03:59.480> can<00:03:59.690> just<00:04:00.280> pull

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
nitrogen stops boiling we can just pull

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.870 
nitrogen stops boiling we can just pull
out<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.519> supports<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:05.230> as<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.410> can<00:04:06.530> see<00:04:06.880> the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
out the supports and as you can see the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.860 
out the supports and as you can see the
Train<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.480> floating<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:10.130> this<00:04:10.250> time<00:04:10.780> it's<00:04:11.780> a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
Train is floating but this time it's a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.539 
Train is floating but this time it's a
lot<00:04:11.989> more<00:04:12.109> stable<00:04:12.410> it's<00:04:12.799> fixed<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:13.459> this

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
lot more stable it's fixed in this

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.420 
lot more stable it's fixed in this
position<00:04:13.970> above<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.420> track<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:15.160> we<00:04:16.160> should<00:04:16.310> be

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
position above the track so we should be

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.350 
position above the track so we should be
able<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.609> make<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.820> go<00:04:18.250> quite<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.280> lot<00:04:19.400> faster

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.909 

here<00:04:23.360> I've<00:04:23.479> got<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.840> short<00:04:24.289> length<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.650> track

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
here I've got a short length of track

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.159 
here I've got a short length of track
and<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.789> show<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.390> most

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
and I can show you that most

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.750 
and I can show you that most
impressively<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:29.210> actually<00:04:29.600> works<00:04:30.760> upside

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
impressively it actually works upside

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.090 
impressively it actually works upside
down<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:35.810> stuff<00:04:36.110> has<00:04:36.380> some<00:04:36.530> pretty<00:04:36.770> amazing

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
down this stuff has some pretty amazing

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.740 
down this stuff has some pretty amazing
properties<00:04:37.729> but<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.450> also<00:04:38.630> has<00:04:38.960> disadvantages

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
properties but it also has disadvantages

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.909 
properties but it also has disadvantages
firstly<00:04:41.750> as<00:04:41.960> we've<00:04:42.229> seen<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.770> keep

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
firstly as we've seen you have to keep

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.440 
firstly as we've seen you have to keep
it<00:04:43.010> very<00:04:43.190> cold<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.820> order<00:04:43.940> for<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.240> work

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
it very cold in order for it to work

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.120 
it very cold in order for it to work
which<00:04:45.050> can<00:04:45.229> be<00:04:45.320> both<00:04:45.410> expensive<00:04:45.860> and

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
which can be both expensive and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.529 
which can be both expensive and
something<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:46.910> an<00:04:47.000> engineering<00:04:47.419> challenge

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
something of an engineering challenge

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.230 
something of an engineering challenge
and<00:04:48.400> secondly<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.700> ones<00:04:49.880> are<00:04:50.000> these<00:04:50.120> that

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and secondly the ones are these that

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.700 
and secondly the ones are these that
work<00:04:50.390> at<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.660> highest<00:04:50.840> temperatures<00:04:51.409> like

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
work at the highest temperatures like

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.830 
work at the highest temperatures like
this<00:04:51.830> stuff<00:04:52.099> our<00:04:52.340> ceramic<00:04:53.270> which<00:04:53.599> means

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
this stuff our ceramic which means

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.480 
this stuff our ceramic which means
they're<00:04:54.080> very<00:04:54.229> brittle<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.800> hard<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.310> draw

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
they're very brittle and hard to draw

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.929 
they're very brittle and hard to draw
out<00:04:55.610> into<00:04:55.849> wires

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
out into wires

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.339 
out into wires
that's<00:04:57.939> why<00:04:58.089> scientists<00:04:58.569> are<00:04:58.749> working<00:04:58.869> to<00:04:59.110> try

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
that's why scientists are working to try

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.959 
that's why scientists are working to try
to<00:04:59.409> find<00:04:59.649> out<00:04:59.800> what<00:05:00.009> makes<00:05:00.189> this<00:05:00.399> stuff<00:05:00.669> tick

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
to find out what makes this stuff tick

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.939 
to find out what makes this stuff tick
in<00:05:01.239> the<00:05:01.599> hope<00:05:01.869> that<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.110> can<00:05:02.199> find<00:05:02.259> materials

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
in the hope that we can find materials

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.409 
in the hope that we can find materials
which<00:05:03.069> work<00:05:03.249> at<00:05:03.459> higher<00:05:03.610> temperatures<00:05:04.239> and

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
which work at higher temperatures and

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.009 
which work at higher temperatures and
are<00:05:05.019> easier<00:05:05.319> to<00:05:05.349> make<00:05:05.589> into<00:05:05.949> useful<00:05:06.099> shapes<00:05:07.019> so

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:08.019 
are easier to make into useful shapes so

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.119 
are easier to make into useful shapes so
with<00:05:08.319> a<00:05:08.349> bit<00:05:08.499> more<00:05:08.529> understanding<00:05:09.069> of

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
with a bit more understanding of

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.639 
with a bit more understanding of
superconductivity<00:05:09.489> and<00:05:10.119> if<00:05:10.899> we<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.199> find<00:05:11.499> a

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:11.649 
superconductivity and if we can find a

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.129 
superconductivity and if we can find a
way<00:05:11.769> to<00:05:11.800> magnetize<00:05:12.489> the<00:05:12.639> pavement<00:05:13.119> then<00:05:13.659> we'll

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
way to magnetize the pavement then we'll

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.959 
way to magnetize the pavement then we'll
all<00:05:14.259> be<00:05:14.379> one<00:05:14.529> step<00:05:14.769> closer<00:05:15.009> to<00:05:15.610> owning<00:05:15.639> our<00:05:15.909> own

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
all be one step closer to owning our own

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.629 
all be one step closer to owning our own
