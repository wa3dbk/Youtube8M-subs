there's a budget there we need to push
it<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.549> much<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.329> absolutely<00:01:33.990> what

I've got to go and do I've got to keep

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
I've got to go and do I've got to keep
making<00:01:36.390> sure<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.200> competing<00:01:37.770> for

but i'm also very mindful having been
other<00:01:42.930> football<00:01:43.320> clubs<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
other football clubs that you don't just

other football clubs that you don't just
throw<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.850> she'll<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> load<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.810> money<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.110> it

teams maybe got a bigger budget than us

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.980 
teams maybe got a bigger budget than us
in<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.770> division<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:13.569> at<00:02:13.630> dozens<00:02:13.930> that

to<00:02:17.050> get<00:02:17.140> promoted<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.770> think<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.580> reality

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
to get promoted I think that's a reality

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.330 
to get promoted I think that's a reality
as<00:02:19.270> well<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:20.140> we<00:02:20.260> also<00:02:20.410> have<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.739> understand

as well that we also have to understand

as well that we also have to understand
as<00:02:21.489> well<00:02:21.520> sometimes<00:02:22.120> clubs<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:22.630> go<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.020> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
as well sometimes clubs really go for it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.770 
as well sometimes clubs really go for it
in<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:24.190> shorter<00:02:24.640> invention<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.270> maybe<00:02:25.480> they

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
in a shorter invention and maybe they

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.930 
in a shorter invention and maybe they
actually<00:02:26.080> get<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.680> they<00:02:26.770> fall<00:02:27.010> down<00:02:27.250> but

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
actually get there or they fall down but

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.460 
actually get there or they fall down but
you'll<00:02:28.120> go<00:02:28.270> for<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.690> period<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.050> time<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you'll go for a period of time and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.729 
you'll go for a period of time and
realize<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:31.000> money<00:02:31.180> dries<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.870> know<00:02:32.020> but

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
realize the money dries up you know but

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.470 
realize the money dries up you know but
I'd<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> think<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> football<00:02:34.360> club

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
