 Let's study is another social network 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.060
 the most commonly used with the largest number 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.890
 so much of users that is facebook what 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.840
 that we will see is on the one hand in a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.300
 first lesson what are all the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.180
 characteristics of this network 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.290
 social is to say how to create an account 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.940
 and above all how to work and configure 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.070
 our account and then on the other hand 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.760
 nothing we already know the characteristics 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.739
 basic and the philosophy way of 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.640
 work, what we will do is apply it 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.460
 to what is the teaching and to our 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.309
 our classes in such a way that we will go 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.170

 some own facebook tools 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.110

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.899
 our our classes and also the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.239
