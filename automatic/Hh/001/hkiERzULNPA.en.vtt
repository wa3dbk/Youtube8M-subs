00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 town so already I'm going to show you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 of the author so that's how it is 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.020
 so she is a lot of windows and there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.130
 it's not me, I 'm doing it and threatening too much 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.130
 this is the case you do it a swimming pool 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 here is the tall pool so the base 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.760
 from the pool down we go back inside 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 to show you the locker room and where 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.730
 So here you open the door if you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.719
 so here we have put two three 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.680
 good here one of the windows goodbye the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 pool here here is the home 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.070
 to pay normally we get into 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.070
 a pool is not free 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 it's not very expensive to mas here thank you 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.850
 so after we close the doors here is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.100
 closes can be of a nature to the verb no 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.380
 70 well after the locker room so we 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.869
 let's press the little button and we 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.650
 let's go into the locker rooms that are 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.479
 completely empty one escapes run but at 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.400
 the less we could at least have put a 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.400
 little good bench it's parra 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.860
 here are the two of this third least 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.350
 dear a galÃ©rien with the doors made 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.830
 comments time but no it's not 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.780
 possible 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.700
 that's how I always won with the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.590
 iron doors so here we find it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.520
 and it's a little trick for because 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.310
 sometimes we are in the trap 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.960
 we will come to see the reception to see 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.540
 stuff like when people have them 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.280
 stuff problems in the genre that's it 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.850
 after you know how does a 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.860
 pool I think so close to 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.390
 stairs at the entrance we do not know 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.350

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.240
 after the wooden bottom going down to 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:42.970

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.820
