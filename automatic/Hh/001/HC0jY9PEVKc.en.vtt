00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 the minute of wine today we will 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
 quietly reveal the heavy 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 secrets that surround the colors of the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.519
 wine why is a wine red white 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.279
 rosé open if the greens is that you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.840
 are colorblind first revelations on 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.609
 never talk about it but the wine does not grow 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 not a supermarket or even among 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 wine merchants the wine is obtained from 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.480
 grapes friends grapes that have for the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 most white pulp their juice is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 so white to get red wine on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.860
 sprinkle the paprika juice and then 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 waited no I'm wrong sheets 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.969
 that's to get red wine so we 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.440
 uses pigmented skin grapes 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.239
 red grape varieties during the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
 vinification let the skin macerate 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.670
 black grapes in the vat of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.780
 fermentation and hop the juice turns red 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.550
 in the skin of white grape varieties in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 contrast no pigment the grapes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 whites will give white wines and the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 pink 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.980
 some claim it is a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 mixture of red wine and white wine 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 allow me to chuckle in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.530
 france in any case this practice is 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 prohibited 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 in fact when vinification the skin 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 black grapes soaks like 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 during the preparation of the red wine 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 it simply macerated in less time 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 at this point she wonders 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.869
 certainly if a red grape can 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 give a white wine 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.560
 this question is appalling of course 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 that we can red grape pulp 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 and white so if we do not let the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.710
 skin macerate in the juice we get the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.570
 white wine but the grape is not the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 only variable in the color of the wine that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 would be too simple the grape variety is at 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 to say the variety of the vine influence him 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 also for example cabernets gives 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.619
 intense blouse dresses that pinot 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 black 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.890
 it is still necessary to mention sugar more 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.290
 Sugar content is high plus the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.820
 color is intense and age the color 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 wine as that of humans 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 moreover, evolved over the years 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 pallice red wines while the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.570
 white wines become darker in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
 end of life all the wines take 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.530
 finally the same orange hue no 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 jealous but it's too late for them 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.490
 enjoy a drink for the very tall 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 wines there is a whole range of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 colors that when we know how to decipher it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 gives indications on the wine a wine 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 purplish or purple is a very young wine 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.790
 red orange or garnet has reached a 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.060
 early aging 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.679
 mahogany aren and obviously too old 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.230
 a blue is probably a product wc 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.270
 that it is better not to drink wine 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 gray of toul in all that it is not 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.290
 gray but pale pink it's actually a wine 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390
 rosé and alsace pinot gris 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 a rosé too he is not at all 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.080
 white will understand 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.970
 next week we will look to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.250
 understand why wine is called the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.870
 wine is not the bluff game what would 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.870
 still a nicer word
