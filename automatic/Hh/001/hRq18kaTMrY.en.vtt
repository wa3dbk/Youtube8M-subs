agonizing painful death it's for an

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
industry in the Orient shark fin soup

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.969 
industry in the Orient shark fin soup
it's<00:04:35.340> considered<00:04:35.789> something<00:04:36.030> special

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
it's considered something special

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.040 
it's considered something special
sharks<00:04:37.979> control<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.849> balance<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.419> our<00:04:39.569> ocean

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
sharks control the balance of our ocean

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.670 
sharks control the balance of our ocean
without<00:04:40.979> sharks<00:04:41.729> our<00:04:42.569> ocean<00:04:43.050> dies

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
without sharks our ocean dies

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.860 
without sharks our ocean dies
they're<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.190> apex<00:04:44.729> predator<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.659> means

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
they're the apex predator that means

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.330 
they're the apex predator that means
he's<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.229> top<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.650> food<00:04:46.830> chain<00:04:46.889> right

he's at the top of the food chain right

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.559 
he's at the top of the food chain right
away<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.639> what<00:04:47.879> you're<00:04:48.000> saying<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.240> sharks

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
away so what you're saying is sharks

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.779 
away so what you're saying is sharks
actually<00:04:49.050> help<00:04:49.289> keep<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.830> balance<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.699> the

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
actually help keep a balance to the

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.550 
actually help keep a balance to the
