00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.160 

I've<00:00:04.819> been<00:00:05.000> preheating<00:00:05.630> the<00:00:05.660> fire<00:00:05.960> magic

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
I've been preheating the fire magic

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.580 
I've been preheating the fire magic
electric<00:00:06.920> for<00:00:07.580> about<00:00:07.759> 15<00:00:08.240> minutes<00:00:08.510> now<00:00:08.690> and

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
electric for about 15 minutes now and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.860 
electric for about 15 minutes now and
what's<00:00:09.830> pretty<00:00:10.010> nice<00:00:10.309> is<00:00:10.670> I<00:00:10.940> was<00:00:11.480> able<00:00:11.570> to<00:00:11.690> just

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
what's pretty nice is I was able to just

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.810 
what's pretty nice is I was able to just
set<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.260> temp<00:00:12.500> that<00:00:12.679> I<00:00:12.710> wanted<00:00:13.219> on<00:00:13.670> the

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
set the temp that I wanted on the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
set the temp that I wanted on the
temperature<00:00:14.240> gauge<00:00:14.389> and<00:00:15.849> in<00:00:16.849> a<00:00:17.480> little<00:00:17.720> while

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
temperature gauge and in a little while

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.300 
temperature gauge and in a little while
once<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:18.140> get<00:00:18.290> these<00:00:18.410> on<00:00:18.619> I'll<00:00:18.770> zoom<00:00:18.980> in<00:00:19.160> and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
once I get these on I'll zoom in and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.790 
once I get these on I'll zoom in and
show<00:00:19.340> you<00:00:19.520> but<00:00:19.820> at<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.570> top<00:00:20.779> there<00:00:21.199> is<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.560> set

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
show you but at the top there is the set

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.679 
show you but at the top there is the set
temperature<00:00:22.039> that<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.490> have<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.119> at<00:00:23.570> the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
temperature that I have and at the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.060 
temperature that I have and at the
bottom<00:00:24.140> there's<00:00:24.350> the<00:00:24.500> actual<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.800> right<00:00:27.800> now

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
bottom there's the actual and right now

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.200 
bottom there's the actual and right now
it's<00:00:28.490> at<00:00:30.699> 661<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:32.360> I<00:00:32.720> set<00:00:33.019> it<00:00:33.170> for<00:00:33.320> 650<00:00:34.220> so<00:00:35.059> it's

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
it's at 661 and I set it for 650 so it's

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.330 
it's at 661 and I set it for 650 so it's
about<00:00:35.420> right<00:00:35.780> because<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.200> needed<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:37.010> go<00:00:37.160> up<00:00:37.250> a

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
about right because I needed to go up a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.549 
about right because I needed to go up a
little<00:00:37.489> bit<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:37.850> when<00:00:38.000> I<00:00:38.030> raise<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.020> lid<00:00:39.260> and

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
little bit so when I raise the lid and

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.190 
little bit so when I raise the lid and
and<00:00:39.770> put<00:00:40.520> these<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.149> burgers<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:41.809> steaks<00:00:41.960> in

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
and put these the burgers and steaks in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:01:04.030 
and put these the burgers and steaks in
there<00:00:42.410> we<00:00:42.890> end<00:00:43.040> up<00:00:43.129> at<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:43.309> right<00:00:43.430> town

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.800 

all<00:01:04.640> right<00:01:04.940> we'll<00:01:05.120> check<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.450> those<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.720> about

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
all right we'll check on those in about

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380 
all right we'll check on those in about
five<00:01:06.170> minutes<00:01:06.910> okay<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:07.940> just<00:01:08.060> wanted<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.300> give

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
five minutes okay I just wanted to give

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.800 
five minutes okay I just wanted to give
you<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.540> quick<00:01:08.810> look<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.340> as<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:11.510> was<00:01:11.630> telling

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
you a quick look at the as I was telling

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.530 
you a quick look at the as I was telling
you<00:01:11.990> earlier<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.410> actual<00:01:12.950> temp<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.430> then<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
you earlier the actual temp and then the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.140 
you earlier the actual temp and then the
set<00:01:14.930> temp<00:01:15.230> is<00:01:15.410> up<00:01:15.530> at<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.710> top<00:01:15.940> so<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.030> keeps

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
set temp is up at the top so it keeps

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.810 
set temp is up at the top so it keeps
track<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.480> both<00:01:17.780> for<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.490> about<00:01:19.490> five<00:01:19.790> minutes

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
track of both for you about five minutes

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.480 
track of both for you about five minutes
let's<00:01:20.510> take<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.720> look<00:01:21.020> at<00:01:21.140> what's<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.310> in

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
let's take a look at what's going on in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's take a look at what's going on in
here<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.790> see<00:01:22.940> what<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.120> looks<00:01:23.270> like

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:46.330 

looks<00:01:31.390> pretty<00:01:31.540> good<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.840> me

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.910 

did<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> nice<00:01:47.579> sear<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.969> and<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
did a nice sear on and they all if you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
did a nice sear on and they all if you
look<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> sear<00:01:50.549> marks<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.210> seem

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
look at all the sear marks they all seem

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240 
look at all the sear marks they all seem
to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> same<00:01:52.170> color<00:01:52.439> meaning<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
to be about the same color meaning that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
to be about the same color meaning that
it<00:01:54.090> appears<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.509> cooking<00:01:54.960> evenly<00:01:55.380> across

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it appears to be cooking evenly across

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.039 
it appears to be cooking evenly across
the<00:01:55.799> entire<00:01:56.310> grill<00:01:56.670> we'll<00:01:57.659> find<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.929> out

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the entire grill we'll find that out

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.399 
the entire grill we'll find that out
later<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> pizza<00:01:59.130> test

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
later when we get to the pizza test

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.779 
later when we get to the pizza test
we're<00:02:01.409> right<00:02:01.619> at<00:02:01.799> eight<00:02:02.100> minutes<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.700> going

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
little longer I don't like my fakes to
cook<00:02:10.259> too<00:02:10.440> long<00:02:10.649> I'm<00:02:11.250> gonna<00:02:11.400> go<00:02:11.489> ahead<00:02:11.550> and
