this is the extension you can see it
fits<00:00:23.060> perfectly<00:00:23.449> in<00:00:23.600> there<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:24.650> what<00:00:24.769> I<00:00:24.800> ended

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:56.139 

and<00:00:47.920> again<00:00:48.129> see<00:00:48.309> it's<00:00:48.430> draining

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.119 

if<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.809> pull<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.170> dipstick<00:00:57.320> it'll<00:00:57.860> come<00:00:58.010> out

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
if you pull the dipstick it'll come out

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.010 
if you pull the dipstick it'll come out
a<00:00:58.160> lot<00:00:58.309> faster<00:00:58.879> that's<00:00:59.539> what<00:00:59.690> I'd<00:00:59.780> end<00:00:59.960> up

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
a lot faster that's what I'd end up

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.220 
a lot faster that's what I'd end up
doing<00:01:00.290> that's<00:01:00.440> why<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.559> came<00:01:00.710> out<00:01:01.989> suddenly<00:01:02.989> a

doing that's why I came out suddenly a
lot<00:01:03.440> more<00:01:04.990> all<00:01:05.990> right<00:01:08.830> now<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.040> isn't<00:01:10.220> quite

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
a flush Honda from my understanding does

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030 
a flush Honda from my understanding does
not<00:01:13.820> suggest<00:01:14.450> doing<00:01:14.899> flushes<00:01:15.560> at<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.830> regular

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
shot maybe go to them but you drain out

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.570 
shot maybe go to them but you drain out
about<00:01:19.250> three<00:01:19.610> or<00:01:19.820> four<00:01:20.030> quarts<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.659> fluid<00:01:21.580> just

here<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.920> acts<00:02:13.069> like<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.310> seal<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.810> Honda<00:02:15.050> guy

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
here that acts like a seal the Honda guy

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.229 
here that acts like a seal the Honda guy
was<00:02:15.440> nice<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.920> gave<00:02:16.099> me<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.280> replacement<00:02:16.940> so

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
was nice and gave me a replacement so

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.170 
was nice and gave me a replacement so
stick<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.349> no<00:02:19.190> use<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.520> reusing<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.150> old

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
stick that on no use in reusing the old

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.180 
stick that on no use in reusing the old
one

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
one

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.410 
one
hopefully<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.400> assume<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> Honda

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
hopefully I assume that the Honda

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
hopefully I assume that the Honda
dealership<00:02:23.780> would<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> same<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.530> I'd<00:02:24.950> got

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
dealership would do the same and I'd got

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.850 
dealership would do the same and I'd got
that<00:02:25.580> when<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.730> bought<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.180> Honda

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that when I bought the Honda

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.900 
that when I bought the Honda
transmission<00:02:27.860> fluid<00:02:28.040> I'd<00:02:28.129> suggest<00:02:28.520> using<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
transmission fluid I'd suggest using the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.000 
transmission fluid I'd suggest using the
Honda<00:02:29.209> stuff<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.629> not<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.860> regular

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
Honda stuff and not just the regular

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.260 
Honda stuff and not just the regular
stuff<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> store<00:02:33.550> all<00:02:34.550> right<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.150> it's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
stuff at the store all right so it's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.150 
stuff at the store all right so it's
pretty<00:02:35.390> much<00:02:35.569> drained<00:02:35.930> I'm<00:02:36.680> go<00:02:36.860> ahead<00:02:37.069> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
pretty much drained I'm go ahead and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.449 
pretty much drained I'm go ahead and
replace

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
replace

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:51.720 
replace
drain<00:02:40.030> plug<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:46.540> doing<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:50.400> tight<00:02:51.400> but<00:02:51.670> you

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
drain plug now in doing so tight but you

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780 
drain plug now in doing so tight but you
don't<00:02:51.879> want<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> kill<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.620> aluminum<00:02:53.790> it's

don't want to kill it it's aluminum it's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.960 
don't want to kill it it's aluminum it's
very<00:02:54.970> easy<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.299> over<00:02:55.599> torque<00:02:55.900> aluminum<00:02:56.939> get<00:02:57.939> a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
very easy to over torque aluminum get a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.490 
very easy to over torque aluminum get a
good<00:02:58.239> snug<00:02:59.640> alright<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> that's<00:03:02.170> that

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
good snug alright and that's that

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.160 
good snug alright and that's that
alright<00:03:03.099> if<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.879> over<00:03:04.420> tighten<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.840> you'll

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
alright if you over tighten it you'll

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.899 
alright if you over tighten it you'll
strip<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.129> then<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.670> have<00:03:06.760> some

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
strip this out and then you have some

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.800 
strip this out and then you have some
real<00:03:07.090> problems<00:03:08.909> okay<00:03:09.909> how<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.120> figure<00:03:10.480> out<00:03:10.629> how

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
real problems okay how I figure out how

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.869 
real problems okay how I figure out how
much<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.109> need<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.319> replace<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:12.579> I'm<00:03:12.700> going<00:03:12.819> to

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
much I need to replace is I'm going to

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.119 
much I need to replace is I'm going to
pour<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.359> oil<00:03:13.389> into<00:03:14.079> an<00:03:14.440> empty<00:03:14.680> container

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
pour the oil into an empty container

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.699 
pour the oil into an empty container
like<00:03:15.340> this<00:03:15.549> it'll<00:03:16.450> tell<00:03:16.780> me<00:03:16.930> how<00:03:17.109> many<00:03:17.170> quarts

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
like this it'll tell me how many quarts

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.599 
like this it'll tell me how many quarts
I've<00:03:18.010> used<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.959> way<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.470> know<00:03:21.069> how<00:03:21.220> much<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
I've used up that way I know how much to

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.629 
I've used up that way I know how much to
return<00:03:22.200> into<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.889> transmission

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
return into the transmission

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.910 
return into the transmission
now<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.510> is<00:03:25.720> assuming<00:03:26.170> I've<00:03:26.319> already

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
now that is assuming I've already

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.610 
now that is assuming I've already
checked<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.609> fluid<00:03:28.000> before<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.780> emptied<00:03:29.530> it

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
checked the fluid before I emptied it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.920 
checked the fluid before I emptied it
and<00:03:29.859> I<00:03:30.790> know<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.239> fluid<00:03:31.510> level<00:03:31.810> is

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
and I know that the fluid level is

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.500 
and I know that the fluid level is
correct<00:03:32.109> so<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> know<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.400> if<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.760> replace<00:03:34.150> how

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
correct so I know that if I replace how

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.839 
correct so I know that if I replace how
much<00:03:34.689> I've<00:03:34.840> taken<00:03:35.049> out<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.560> should<00:03:36.159> be<00:03:36.609> at<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
much I've taken out I should be at the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.720 
much I've taken out I should be at the
same<00:03:37.230> should<00:03:38.230> be<00:03:38.349> at<00:03:38.439> the<00:03:38.530> correct<00:03:38.799> level<00:03:39.220> in

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
same should be at the correct level in

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.949 
same should be at the correct level in
the<00:03:39.819> transmission<00:03:40.359> when<00:03:40.450> I'm<00:03:40.569> done

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the transmission when I'm done

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.199 
the transmission when I'm done
yeah<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:42.040> definitely<00:03:42.250> want<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.670> verify<00:03:42.819> that

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
yeah you definitely want to verify that

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.180 
yeah you definitely want to verify that
afterwards<00:03:43.720> I'm<00:03:44.500> not<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.799> show<00:03:44.889> you<00:03:44.949> me

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
afterwards I'm not going to show you me

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.710 
afterwards I'm not going to show you me
pouring<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.730> into<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.120> because<00:03:46.389> that's<00:03:46.599> just

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
pouring it into this because that's just

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.030 
pouring it into this because that's just
the<00:03:46.810> way<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.049> time<00:03:47.199> but<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.799> thought<00:03:47.919> I'd

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
the way it's time but just thought I'd

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.349 
the way it's time but just thought I'd
let<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.190> know<00:03:48.310> one<00:03:48.639> trick<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.209> could

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
let you know one trick that you could

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.460 
let you know one trick that you could
use<00:03:51.480> all<00:03:52.480> right<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> dipstick<00:03:54.840> right<00:03:55.840> here

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
use all right so the dipstick right here

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.089 
use all right so the dipstick right here
it's<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.739> yellow<00:03:58.319> thing<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.530> looks<00:03:59.709> like<00:03:59.769> this

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
it's a yellow thing it looks like this

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.180 
it's a yellow thing it looks like this
so<00:04:01.090> we<00:04:01.150> check<00:04:01.449> the<00:04:01.569> fluid<00:04:01.900> on<00:04:02.040> that's<00:04:03.040> where

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
so we check the fluid on that's where

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.949 
so we check the fluid on that's where
else<00:04:03.430> we're<00:04:03.609> going<00:04:03.699> to<00:04:03.790> fill<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.209> there's<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
else we're going to fill it in there's a

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:12.349 
else we're going to fill it in there's a
hole<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:07.000> barely<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.229> it<00:04:08.319> straight<00:04:08.940> straight

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.520 

it's<00:04:13.359> hard<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.629> see<00:04:13.780> it's<00:04:13.930> right<00:04:14.169> there<00:04:14.379> but

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
it's hard to see it's right there but

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's hard to see it's right there but
you'll<00:04:14.680> be<00:04:14.799> able<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.979> see<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.639> we<00:04:15.760> use<00:04:15.879> a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
you'll be able to see and we use a

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.339 
you'll be able to see and we use a
transmission<00:04:16.650> fill<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.949> funnel<00:04:18.989> into<00:04:19.989> that

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
transmission fill a funnel into that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.640 
transmission fill a funnel into that
hole<00:04:20.739> right<00:04:21.419> there<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.960> transmission<00:04:23.470> file

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
hole right there the transmission file

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.909 
hole right there the transmission file
looks<00:04:23.949> kind<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.280> like<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:26.110> works<00:04:26.650> well

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
looks kind of like this it works well

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.670 
looks kind of like this it works well
getting<00:04:27.580> right<00:04:27.789> down<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:28.240> there<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:29.260> now<00:04:29.650> I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
getting right down in there and now I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.430 
getting right down in there and now I
need<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.949> put<00:04:30.070> about<00:04:30.280> 4<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.000> 1/10<00:04:31.990> quarts

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
need to put about 4 and 1/10 quarts

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.240 
need to put about 4 and 1/10 quarts
trying<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.490> glue<00:04:33.669> it<00:04:33.760> into<00:04:34.030> it<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.590> just<00:04:36.039> pour

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
trying to glue it into it so just pour

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.400 
trying to glue it into it so just pour
it<00:04:36.340> in
