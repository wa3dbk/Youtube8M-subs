and this is going to be a completely
individualized<00:00:25.680> design<00:00:26.279> choice<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> does

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
individualized design choice but it does

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
individualized design choice but it does
need<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.470> fully<00:00:28.920> qualified<00:00:29.010> domain<00:00:29.519> name

Directory domain now some people like to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.549 
Directory domain now some people like to
use<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.100> same<00:00:59.550> domain<00:01:00.059> name<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.289> use

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
use the same domain name that they use

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
use the same domain name that they use
on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.039> internet<00:01:02.550> like<00:01:03.359> IT<00:01:03.930> dvds<00:01:04.470> calm<00:01:05.090> but

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
on the internet like IT dvds calm but

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.929 
on the internet like IT dvds calm but
others<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.619> internal<00:01:08.310> top-level

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
others like to use an internal top-level

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.620 
others like to use an internal top-level
domain<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.689> IT<00:01:09.990> dvds<00:01:10.640> dot<00:01:11.640> local<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
domain like IT dvds dot local this is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
domain like IT dvds dot local this is
not<00:01:12.840> something<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.680> used<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
not something that can be used on the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.590 
not something that can be used on the
internet<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:16.070> therefore<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.939> seen<00:01:18.270> as

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
internet and therefore it can be seen as

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.609 
internet and therefore it can be seen as
being<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.650> secure<00:01:20.240> also<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.360> i<00:01:21.479> use<00:01:21.750> IT<00:01:22.080> dvds

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
being more secure also if i use IT dvds

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.640 
being more secure also if i use IT dvds
calm<00:01:23.610> i'll<00:01:24.000> probably<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> set<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.380> what's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
calm i'll probably have to set up what's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.109 
calm i'll probably have to set up what's
called<00:01:25.710> split-brain<00:01:26.369> dns<00:01:27.060> where<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.740> our

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
internal IT dvds calm zones and then we

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.749 
internal IT dvds calm zones and then we
have<00:01:33.210> external<00:01:33.840> IT<00:01:34.170> dvds<00:01:34.650> calm<00:01:35.100> zones<00:01:35.490> and

have external IT dvds calm zones and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.620 
have external IT dvds calm zones and
they<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.630> different<00:01:37.170> IP<00:01:37.619> addresses<00:01:38.630> now

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
they have different IP addresses now

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
they have different IP addresses now
some<00:01:40.229> people<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.070> making<00:01:41.369> things

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
some people see this as making things

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
some people see this as making things
more<00:01:42.299> complex<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.369> like<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> use<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.680> domain

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
more complex and like to use a domain

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260 
more complex and like to use a domain
name<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.310> used<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> internet

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
name that can be used on the internet

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050 
name that can be used on the internet
but<00:01:48.630> maybe<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.560> exactly<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
but maybe not exactly the same as the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
but maybe not exactly the same as the
one<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:51.960> currently<00:01:52.259> using<00:01:52.860> let's<00:01:53.040> say

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
one they're currently using let's say

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
one they're currently using let's say
for<00:01:53.430> their<00:01:53.520> external<00:01:54.060> website<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.950> may<00:01:56.490> use

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
for their external website so i may use

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.139 
for their external website so i may use
IT<00:01:57.329> DVDs<00:01:57.869> net<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.430> register<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
IT DVDs net and then go register that

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.450 
IT DVDs net and then go register that
domain<00:02:00.210> name<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.590> GoDaddy

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
domain name with something like GoDaddy

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.660

or<00:02:02.670> network<00:02:03.000> solutions<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.159> then<00:02:05.159> i<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.520> be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
or network solutions and then i would be

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.990

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
able to set up that delegation but we'll

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.589 
able to set up that delegation but we'll
talk<00:05:32.159> about<00:05:32.219> more<00:05:32.460> about<00:05:32.909> this<00:05:33.090> when<00:05:33.300> we<00:05:33.360> get

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
talk about more about this when we get

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.290 
talk about more about this when we get
into<00:05:33.780> DNS<00:05:34.349> later<00:05:35.039> on<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:35.940> I'll<00:05:36.030> going<00:05:36.210> to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
continue click yes now we get to decide

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.469 
continue click yes now we get to decide

it's<00:05:49.860> best<00:05:50.219> practice<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.969> put<00:05:51.509> each<00:05:52.229> of<00:05:52.469> these

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
it's best practice to put each of these

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.320 
it's best practice to put each of these
files<00:05:53.039> are<00:05:53.400> each<00:05:53.550> of<00:05:53.669> these<00:05:53.759> folders<00:05:54.150> on

files are each of these folders on

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.159 
files are each of these folders on
different<00:05:55.229> physical<00:05:56.099> drives<00:05:56.810> so<00:05:57.810> that's

different physical drives so that's

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.629 
different physical drives so that's
