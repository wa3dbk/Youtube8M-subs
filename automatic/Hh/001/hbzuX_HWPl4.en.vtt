00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 yes I am 19 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.570
 I made this plate with talk 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.370
 talc 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
 we were in the pub somehow 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 got to know us 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 I think that was the favor of things 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 just that the horse is just time 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 so let's say our studio 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.870
 busy because he is fresh there with the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.020
 saved his album 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.740
 and I just found it interesting 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.130
 to go somewhere 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.460
 and just to work away from there 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.460
 Hall 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.920
 everyday life and city and 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 by coincidence, this has just result 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 with this with this forest cottage like that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.160
 I would have a house in the mountains 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.230
 taken or or on a roof or 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.020
 so 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:02.820
 fuck the view from the couch from vocal 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.970
 album love writes though horn sound 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.880
 the way from the couch rock and pop 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.290
 Actually, the third trek was actually 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.520
 the first one we recorded that 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.040
 We are happy to announce that we have one too 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 very cruelly resumed and we 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.440
 had these 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 we have couch pillows between the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.490
 Tiled stove and the band squeezed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 so that is how a kind of profession is and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.030
 Alone the departure enough and if 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.350
 he then a funny classetor 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:39.670
 i was with the chelsea years ago 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.840
 jesse of choice persistent to jesse so yes that 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 was the first track we recorded 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.310
 but not as he is there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 hanks party mood damn the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 shoes from her can be your advertising 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.930
 on 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.729
 today is tomorrow then comes in the heart 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.850
 prag if I find you are just like that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.649
 Fresh is fantastic from the boom factory 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.950
 you do you wear it you do it 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.630
 somehow do or outgrow what i do 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.060
 Stop hoping on the main stage 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 frankfurter hardly hits the big clubs 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.970
 1000 the surfer chance 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.960
 was the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.370
 was the second 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.410
 limits we have recorded 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.510
 which I actually on the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.170
 have written automobile and while 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.110
 of the recording process during the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.780
 Processes stop there by durchs 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910
 tilt in the mpc we have the junk 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.320
 speed detected in any case it was 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.920
 a spontaneous decision that we have jobs 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.600
 on the way 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.710
 otherwise he would have come to the car 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.260
 You do not really feel like that anymore 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.660
 can imagine correctly 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.120
 it just did not fit again 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.739
 Tracking sit writes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.299
 to reduce scarcely rise up to one 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.470
 half day after such slow 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.470
 offers needs 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 even getting in white free 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.920
 glances the obstler finest 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.020
 enemy musician mixing houses 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.410
 produced in the forest on songs and world 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.350
 on 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.140
 I always do the same only none 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.010
 art white art operator klaus kinski 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.880
 I prefer to go out and work out yes 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.070
 laurel leaf hate in any case there 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.990
 bay leaf produces I have there 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.790
 but I 've got it 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.430
 actually more of that produces a lot 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.180
 or have already said so 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.940
 laid out sketches and then said okay 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.110
 there was something for me, too 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.010
 sometimes forest just a sample 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.730
 air as you so yes that somehow a 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.890
 Feeling for so and though, so to speak 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.100
 simply produced with drums 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.840
 provided or else what can happen 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.640
 one still has to say about the situation there 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.910
 There it really does not have any 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.910
 reception 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 if you really meticulously sought that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.890
 do you have somewhere a half bar 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.890
 has an sms can receive 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.640
 and it was quiet so there is at the moment 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.260
 that we sat in the room 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.110
 work filmed it was quiet the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.800
 Window wall open one has 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.110
 quarter heard again 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.700
 and then there was a total silence 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:22.560
 so classical a picture stabilizer 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.560
 work and that was 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.930
 I had then a twice as 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.490
 awareness of a baby crass as crass 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.350
 it really is separate 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.140
 internet offers the full repertoire 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.480
 Everyone sticks the camps of his head 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.370
 from women read shades of why walsh 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.370
 lying in bed our current now makes 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.960
 the sun 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.479
 I would now the ten new plate 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.910
 not as a pure battle rap or something 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.440
 describe 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.380
 I do not know how to call it 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.000
 should be so but yes it definitely has 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.430
 already 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.200
 what made it all alone 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.520
 work 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.180
 maybe you will learn here too 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.750
 a little more about the people the 99th 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.430
 plate 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.390
 this good piece 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.300
 it's always only 9 as we ourselves 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.310
 There are also instruments of the stairs 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.930
 I think from the moment it is not 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.040
 not so much there so you have to 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.240
 if you have the instruments now 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.240
 you want to hurry 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.010
 on hv de there is this to acquire 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.010
 good piece 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 No
