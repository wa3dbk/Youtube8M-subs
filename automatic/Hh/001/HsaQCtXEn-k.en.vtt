00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
um as well and I'll saturate my hair in

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470 
um as well and I'll saturate my hair in
those<00:02:19.190> little<00:02:19.400> sections<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.209> come<00:02:20.450> through

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
those little sections and come through

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.520 
those little sections and come through
like<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.270> don't<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> lot<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.170> hair

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
like so if you don't have a lot of hair

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430 
like so if you don't have a lot of hair
it<00:02:24.800> makes<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> lot<00:02:25.400> easier<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.320> have

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it makes it a lot easier you don't have

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.370 
it makes it a lot easier you don't have
to<00:02:27.620> use<00:02:27.770> some<00:02:28.040> inspections<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.000> I've<00:02:29.900> got<00:02:30.110> so
