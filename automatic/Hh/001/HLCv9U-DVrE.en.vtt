it's pinned up like in a ponytail and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.660

it<00:03:36.820> up<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.500> do<00:03:41.860> three<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.190> these

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
it up and I just do three of these

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.070 
it up and I just do three of these
braids<00:03:42.820> I<00:03:43.500> found<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.650> when<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:44.830> do<00:03:45.870> more<00:03:46.870> than

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
braids I found that when I do more than

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.020

three<00:03:47.320> it<00:03:47.470> really<00:03:47.680> doesn't<00:03:47.950> make<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.460> big

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
three it really doesn't make a big

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.540 
three it really doesn't make a big
difference<00:03:49.270> so<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.460> three<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.790> them<00:03:53.550> go

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
difference so I just do three of them go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.500 
difference so I just do three of them go

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.600 
ahead and just do this and again if you
swim<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> lot<00:03:59.080> if<00:03:59.560> you're<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.160> position<00:04:00.310> where
