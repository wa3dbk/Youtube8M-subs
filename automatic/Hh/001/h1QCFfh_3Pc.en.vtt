00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.110
 how about friends here being so welcome 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.650
 This is a special dedicated to the web of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.930
 tri mission with secrets and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.330
 references that the moment is there in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.890
 great forums 5 I'll start with two 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.110
 secrets that are the ones that probably 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 already many know because they are already somewhat 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.340
 I ask you a little patience 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.020
 friends because I know that most of them 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 You should know them but I also bring you 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 two new secrets concerning this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 game that I'm almost sure not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 many are going to meet so I'm going to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 start with the first one is about a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.250
 book that is in the new house that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 lester offers franklin franklin 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.359
 obviously nothing silly accepts the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.219
 house in the campaign and everything in the bookseller 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.289
 where are all their positions where 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.359
 is the living room we are going to find 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.980
 a book that is dedicated to john 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.960
 marston protagonist of red dead 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.909
 redemption there is a theory that many 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 they say it's John marston's 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.980
 juniors better known as jack marston 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 that your son wrote this book but not 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.400
 precisely because it's a book I had 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.229
 than having been written by some 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.620
 character simply a reference to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.090
 one as a historical to this game by 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.979
 so for me 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 reiter obviously not distributed broadcast 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 but we can conclude by jay 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 marston that is about a historical 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.009
 dedicated to john marston the second is a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.319
 mural that pays homage to this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 game this historical is as well as with 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.520
 so simple is not as father as the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
 others for even so I think it's worth 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.409
 I'm sorry to show it because I say it's a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.630
 great game is a mural are the mansion 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 with his horse with a mural a bit like that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 as from the scenery of this game the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.530
 third secret is that I think not much 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.209
 people will know is about the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.799
 appearance of this giant service will 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.989
 let's leave it like giant pig 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.599
 because I know that in English it's wild world 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.579
 something like a wild pig but in 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:03.360
 Spanish I do not know if it has any meaning 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.280
 or some literal translation so what 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 we will leave like giant pig is a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.989
 animal that is very common to see in retro and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.420
 of emission is indeed the best 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.239
 that there is or in March did not kill and sell to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 his skin and a lot of things then what 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.110
 we can find here is only the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.760
 Campaign mode on the outskirts of the city 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.220
 they will not be able to find it in mode 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.930
 online so what do I do 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.700
 interesting about this secret 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.170
 is that even though you kill 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 this giant pig even though what 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.150
 pursue even if they escape if 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 you go back to this location go 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.689
 to see how to expose just there 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.510
 where they saw that I shot him is going to be 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.829
 exposes again and again and again by 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.719
 So we can conclude that 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.790
 indeed it is a story 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.280
 concerning this game and to finish 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.290
 we have coffee redemption that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.079
 It's literally a normal coffee but 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.090
 has as logo this giant pig to 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.010
 this wild word and good for me is not a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.659
 coincidence is to say mission caferri 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.239
 obviously it's about dead network 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.639
 redemption and if that were not enough we have to 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.530
 that animal so I hope that you 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.659
 have liked this video friends there is a 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.430
 more reference you are asked big 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.530
 but since it 's a mission they give you 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.540
 when you complete and play 100% and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.909
 I have not finished yet, I 'm missing as a 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 10% more or less then I can not 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.299
 show even so I hope you have them 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.040
 liked this video share it with your 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.200
 friends I hope you can support me with a 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.200
 like and see you in the next bye
