00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 flying electric flying giteau we are the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.429
 February 4 at three rivers it is less 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.950
 17 this morning so temperature not very 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.929
 cold finally we said we know 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.340
 lower temperatures and that I 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 wanted to introduce you to the band that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.269
 Made in Quebec by Quebecers who 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 know the Quebec winters and 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.430
 this is the sweet version he 25 firefighters 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.320
 so more than 6 meters in diameter and the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.059
 peculiarity is that the son of omar 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.120
 flexible even at -40 so that remains little 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 steep as we see the aubades 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.700
 so I unplug here really went 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 watch the overwhelming knows an effect 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:09.689
 less simple you still look 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:18.509
 her breasts I can do it tomorrow as 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:21.119
 in summer bingo it was also borde 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.299
 so it was complicated so now 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.740
 we are used a design terminal 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.890
 Californian American so from 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 make cynical prices 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 notice so want to keep i have to try 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.329
 to go steer the rate of this is a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.329
 spaghetti 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.590
 it's cold they're what if it takes 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.360
 to be that but lille tomorrow for which 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.310
 they are 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.690
 it's probably temperatures 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:03.410
 that we never see I'm ok is this 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:10.820
 that the car is far the choice of the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 series from the outset when his skin - 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.530
 because years and I have not seen with both my hands 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 he tomorrow to align the gun because 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.740
 it's very steep and now 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.320
 we will try to roll the rope after 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.980
 the break so let's go 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.860
 no we go both hands crossed because 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:50.239
 that otherwise you will be October 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:55.930
 we try to steal his so here so 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.400
 the terminal and video click here allows you to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:06.470
 really who is really suited to 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:12.370
 Quebec winters have one hand 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.370
 it's my new look keep but that's it
