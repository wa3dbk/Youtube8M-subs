for<00:00:14.730> your<00:00:14.880> fiddlehead<00:00:15.450> fern<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.199> you're<00:00:16.350> going

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
for your fiddlehead fern so you're going

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.410 
for your fiddlehead fern so you're going
to<00:00:16.500> come<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> point<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:17.880> echo<00:00:18.270> that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
to come to a point and then echo that

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.060 
to come to a point and then echo that
line<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.109> back<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> starting

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
line all the way back to the starting

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.779 
line all the way back to the starting
point<00:00:20.390> you're<00:00:21.390> creating<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.020> stem<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
point you're creating a stem for all the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.800 
point you're creating a stem for all the
rest<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> kind<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> fiddlehead<00:00:25.529> swirly

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
rest of the kind of fiddlehead swirly

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.679 
rest of the kind of fiddlehead swirly
spiral<00:00:27.810> leaves<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.949> branched<00:00:29.340> off<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.730> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
spiral leaves to be branched off of so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
spiral leaves to be branched off of so
now<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> second<00:00:31.590> step<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.040> simply<00:00:32.489> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
now the second step is just simply to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.139 
now the second step is just simply to
travel<00:00:33.239> stitch<00:00:33.450> along<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.960> stem<00:00:34.460> swirl<00:00:35.460> into

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
travel stitch along the stem swirl into

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.840 
travel stitch along the stem swirl into
a<00:00:36.450> spiral<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.719> stim

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
a spiral and then go back to the stim

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
a spiral and then go back to the stim
travel<00:00:41.850> stitch<00:00:42.030> back<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.480> swirl<00:00:43.379> into<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
travel stitch back up swirl into a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.619 
travel stitch back up swirl into a
spiral<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.320> then<00:00:46.320> stitch<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.190> again

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
spiral and then stitch back down again

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.709 
spiral and then stitch back down again
and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.289> tricky<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.719> because

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
and it's a little tricky to see because

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
and it's a little tricky to see because
it's<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.289> small<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.010> tiny<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.270> but

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it's so small and tiny right here but

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's so small and tiny right here but
I'm<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.350> bit<00:00:55.559> bigger<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I'm going to get a little bit bigger in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
I'm going to get a little bit bigger in
just<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> second<00:00:56.820> you'll<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.090> able<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
just a second you'll be able to see a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.260 
just a second you'll be able to see a
bit<00:00:57.719> better<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> there<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> swirl<00:00:59.850> into

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
bit better so there you go I swirl into

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
bit better so there you go I swirl into
that<00:01:00.420> spiral<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.350> an<00:01:01.440> open<00:01:01.890> spiral<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that spiral and it's an open spiral so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
that spiral and it's an open spiral so
I'm<00:01:02.640> leaving<00:01:03.090> space<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.390> myself<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> back

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I'm leaving space for myself to get back

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.850 
I'm leaving space for myself to get back
out<00:01:04.559> again<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.240> reconnect<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
out again and reconnect with that

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
out again and reconnect with that
starting<00:01:07.860> stem<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.140> cool<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.170> about

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
starting stem and the cool thing about

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.890 
starting stem and the cool thing about
this<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> realize<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:12.720> actually

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this if you realize that you're actually

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
this if you realize that you're actually
stitching<00:01:13.590> more<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.369> less<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> shape<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
stitching more or less the shape of a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
stitching more or less the shape of a
feather<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
feather and if you want to think of it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.450 
feather and if you want to think of it
that<00:01:17.610> way<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.430> way<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that way this is a really good way of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
that way this is a really good way of
practicing<00:01:21.060> feathers<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.470> good<00:01:22.619> way

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
practicing feathers and it's a good way

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.969 
practicing feathers and it's a good way
of<00:01:22.830> practicing<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.700> shape<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:25.500> another

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of practicing that shape it's another

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.520 
of practicing that shape it's another
way<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> stitching<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> feather<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.530> swirling

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
way of stitching a feather and swirling

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.200 
way of stitching a feather and swirling
into<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.040> spiral<00:01:29.670> rather<00:01:29.939> than

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
into that spiral rather than

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.480 
into that spiral rather than
concentrating<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.380> making<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> plane<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
concentrating on making just a plane to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.940 
concentrating on making just a plane to
your<00:01:32.610> drop<00:01:32.850> shape<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
your drop shape so here you can see I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.980 
your drop shape so here you can see I
fast<00:01:35.250> forwarded<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> opposite<00:01:36.390> side<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
fast forwarded to the opposite side and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.030 
fast forwarded to the opposite side and
I'm<00:01:37.799> working<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.869> angle<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> did

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I'm working on this angle and what I did

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.350 
I'm working on this angle and what I did
basically<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.670> i<00:01:41.759> stitched<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> way

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
basically was i stitched all the way

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
basically was i stitched all the way
down<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> bottom<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.590> can't<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
down to the bottom and then I can't I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
down to the bottom and then I can't I
travel<00:01:44.579> stitch<00:01:44.759> back<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> top<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
travel stitch back up to the top that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
travel stitch back up to the top that
way<00:01:45.990> both<00:01:46.500> sides<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> fiddlehead<00:01:47.820> fern

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
way both sides of the fiddlehead fern

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
way both sides of the fiddlehead fern
had<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> same<00:01:48.780> angle<00:01:49.350> i'm<00:01:49.409> working<00:01:49.799> from<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
had the same angle i'm working from that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.940 
had the same angle i'm working from that
top<00:01:50.490> corner<00:01:51.000> down<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.680> really

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
top corner down and that's really

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.880 
top corner down and that's really
important<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> quilters<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.170> try<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
important a lot of quilters will try and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
important a lot of quilters will try and
stitch<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.360> end<00:01:57.479> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
stitch all the way down to the end of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.179 
stitch all the way down to the end of
the<00:01:58.140> spy<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.710> stem<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.570> then<00:02:00.570> try

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
the spy of the stem and then try

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.499 
the spy of the stem and then try
literally<00:02:02.189> rotating<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> stitching<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
literally rotating it and stitching the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.179 
literally rotating it and stitching the
same<00:02:03.810> angle<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.380> from<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> opposite

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
same angle but from the opposite

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.340 
same angle but from the opposite
direction<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.750> simply<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
direction and that just simply does not

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.639 
direction and that just simply does not
work<00:02:07.670> at<00:02:08.670> least<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.090> doesn't<00:02:09.300> work<00:02:09.599> for<00:02:09.840> me<00:02:09.869> i'd

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
work at least it doesn't work for me i'd

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.800 
work at least it doesn't work for me i'd
like<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.220> either<00:02:11.340> break<00:02:11.790> thread<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.540> i<00:02:12.569> get

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
like to either break thread when i get

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.490 
like to either break thread when i get
down<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
down to that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.090 
down to that
into<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> stem<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.570> or<00:02:16.200> travel<00:02:16.890> such

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
into the stem and then I or travel such

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.380 
into the stem and then I or travel such
you<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> break<00:02:18.060> through<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.300> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you don't have to break through if you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
you don't have to break through if you
don't<00:02:18.540> want<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.020> travel<00:02:19.590> stitch<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
don't want to or travel stitch all the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.070 
don't want to or travel stitch all the
way<00:02:20.310> back<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.090> starting<00:02:21.600> point<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
way back up to the starting point and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.070 
way back up to the starting point and
start<00:02:22.740> back<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:23.580> top<00:02:23.970> bit<00:02:24.600> because

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
start back at the very top bit because

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.470 
start back at the very top bit because
you<00:02:25.710> get<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> same<00:02:26.280> angle<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.910> basically<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you get the same angle and basically the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.190 
you get the same angle and basically the
same<00:02:27.690> effect<00:02:28.340> stitching<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.490> way<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:30.330> you're

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
same effect stitching that way if you're

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.810 
same effect stitching that way if you're
down<00:02:31.830> there<00:02:32.010> at<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> bottom<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.670> you're

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
down there at the bottom and you're

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.600 
down there at the bottom and you're
still<00:02:33.090> trying<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.810> nice<00:02:34.610> downward

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
still trying to get this nice downward

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.550 
still trying to get this nice downward
angle<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.510> working<00:02:36.900> from<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> opposite

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
angle but working from the opposite

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.310 
angle but working from the opposite
direction<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.640> very<00:02:38.790> difficult

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
direction it's just very very difficult

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.220 
direction it's just very very difficult
so<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:40.709> as<00:02:40.980> they<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:42.030> more<00:02:42.090> space<00:02:42.900> in

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
so you can see as they get more space in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.100 
so you can see as they get more space in
my<00:02:43.410> quilting<00:02:43.800> space<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.430> use<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.450> space<00:02:45.870> to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
my quilting space I use that space to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.220 
my quilting space I use that space to
make<00:02:46.230> bigger<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.950> bigger<00:02:47.190> spirals<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
make bigger and bigger spirals and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
make bigger and bigger spirals and
fiddleheads<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:50.340> may<00:02:50.550> adds<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
fiddleheads and that may adds to the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.760 
fiddleheads and that may adds to the
design<00:02:51.390> as<00:02:51.570> well<00:02:51.600> if<00:02:52.200> you're<00:02:52.440> trying<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
design as well if you're trying to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.300 
design as well if you're trying to
squish<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.250> into<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> small<00:02:54.090> area<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:56.010> works

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
squish this into a small area it works

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.490 
squish this into a small area it works
perfectly<00:02:56.850> fine<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.780> squish<00:02:58.260> those

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
perfectly fine and you can squish those

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.040 
perfectly fine and you can squish those
smaller<00:02:58.920> spirals<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.239> as<00:03:00.420> soon<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
smaller spirals in but as soon as you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.229 
smaller spirals in but as soon as you
have<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.709> bit<00:03:01.830> more<00:03:01.980> space<00:03:02.340> start

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
have a little bit more space start

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.090 
have a little bit more space start
expanding<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.959> design<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.950> what

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
expanding the design and see what

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.280 
expanding the design and see what
happens<00:03:05.459> then<00:03:05.750> here's<00:03:06.750> what<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:06.989> looks<00:03:07.140> like

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
happens then here's what it looks like

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.570 
happens then here's what it looks like
whenever<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.739> finish<00:03:08.030> fiddlehead<00:03:09.030> fern
