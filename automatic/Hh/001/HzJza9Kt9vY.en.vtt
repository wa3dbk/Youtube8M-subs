00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
make sense so what we're going to do is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.869 
make sense so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> show<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> how<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> very

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
we're going to show you how to do a very

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.470 
we're going to show you how to do a very
very<00:00:53.940> quick<00:00:54.180> cut<00:00:54.750> using<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.350> jig<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:57.030> quite

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
very quick cut using this jig now quite

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
very quick cut using this jig now quite
simply<00:00:57.809> first<00:00:58.559> procedure<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.129> need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
simply first procedure we need to do is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.709 
simply first procedure we need to do is
we<00:00:59.789> need<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> measure<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> depth<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
we need to measure the depth to the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
we need to measure the depth to the
worktop<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:02.190> particular<00:01:02.489> case<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.059> 600

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
worktop this particular case it's 600

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.880 
worktop this particular case it's 600
millimeters<00:01:04.549> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> back<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> will

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
millimeters on the back here you will

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
millimeters on the back here you will
notice<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.490> different<00:01:08.880> markings<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.360> 255

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
notice all different markings from 255

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
notice all different markings from 255
50<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> 700<00:01:12.060> we're<00:01:12.479> looking<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> 600

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
50 up to 700 we're looking for the 600

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
50 up to 700 we're looking for the 600
that<00:01:13.979> sets<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> depth<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> our<00:01:15.330> female<00:01:16.290> cuts

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that sets the depth of our female cuts

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
that sets the depth of our female cuts
we<00:01:16.799> literally<00:01:17.100> push<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.280> peg<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> just

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
we literally push the peg in and just

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.760 
we literally push the peg in and just
push<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.350> tighten<00:01:19.680> its

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
push it so it's just in tighten its

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.170 
push it so it's just in tighten its
below<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> surface<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
below the surface now we need to get it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
below the surface now we need to get it
below<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> surface<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> router<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
below the surface because the router is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.490 
below the surface because the router is
going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> run<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:25.439> thing

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
going to run over there the other thing

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.999 
going to run over there the other thing
as<00:01:25.740> well<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.570> explained<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
as well it's all explained here on this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.060 
as well it's all explained here on this
little<00:01:29.189> diagram<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.840> tells<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.070> whether

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
little diagram here tells you whether

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
little diagram here tells you whether
the<00:01:32.220> workshop<00:01:32.970> should<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.299> face<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.049> face

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the workshop should be face up or face

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
the workshop should be face up or face
down<00:01:34.619> depending<00:01:35.250> which<00:01:35.520> cut<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.960> doing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
down depending which cut so we're doing

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
down depending which cut so we're doing
this<00:01:37.259> particular<00:01:37.470> cut<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this particular cut here which is a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
this particular cut here which is a
right<00:01:39.000> hand<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.530> we<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> workshop

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
right hand and we know that the workshop

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.950 
right hand and we know that the workshop
needs<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.670> face-up<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:42.840> all

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
needs to be face-up so that's all

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
needs to be face-up so that's all
self-explanatory<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> we

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
self-explanatory we also know that we

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
self-explanatory we also know that we
need<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.360> mild<00:01:45.720> joint<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> female<00:01:46.619> joint

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
need a mild joint and a female joint

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
need a mild joint and a female joint
well<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.340> cutting<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> female<00:01:48.090> joint<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
well we're cutting the female joint so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.819 
well we're cutting the female joint so

moved it slightly make sure it's located
on<00:02:19.349> those<00:02:19.530> pins<00:02:19.800> clamp<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.430> nicely<00:02:20.640> one<00:02:20.970> end

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
on those pins clamp it nicely one end

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.690 
on those pins clamp it nicely one end
and<00:02:22.140> clamp<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.739> nicely<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> other<00:02:23.280> end<00:02:23.519> just
