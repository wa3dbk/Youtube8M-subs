for a very short time and see how fast

the<00:00:34.020> bar<00:00:34.230> moves<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> shoot<00:00:35.430> by

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
really quickly it's a trap and you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
really quickly it's a trap and you
shouldn't<00:00:37.559> pick<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.040> whereas<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.820> course

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
shouldn't pick it up whereas of course

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.600 
shouldn't pick it up whereas of course
if<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> bar<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.780> slow<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.500> probably<00:00:41.219> safe<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
if the bar is slow it's probably safe to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
if the bar is slow it's probably safe to
take<00:00:42.030> tada<00:00:42.600> simple<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.500> there's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> good

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

could gauge how fast the bar moved or if

long you hold the button and sure enough

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
long you hold the button and sure enough
it<00:01:37.560> worked<00:01:37.829> where<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.490> how<00:01:38.640> fast

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it worked where you could see how fast

it worked where you could see how fast
the<00:01:39.060> bar<00:01:39.210> moved<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the bar moved and I can use that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
the bar moved and I can use that
knowledge<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.799> able<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> quickly<00:01:41.400> scan<00:01:41.820> a

so<00:01:43.950> awesome<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.909> considered<00:01:45.390> making<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.780> video

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so awesome I considered making a video

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
so awesome I considered making a video
about<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> did<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> do

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
about it back then but I did what I do

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
about it back then but I did what I do
with<00:01:48.420> basically<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.439> video<00:01:49.829> ideas<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
with basically all of my video ideas and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.910 
with basically all of my video ideas and
that<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> run<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> through<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.720> scan<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that is to run it through a scan of is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.030 
that is to run it through a scan of is
this<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.970> worth<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.630> video<00:01:55.110> number<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
this really worth of video number one is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
this really worth of video number one is
it<00:01:56.310> original<00:01:56.850> has<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> already<00:01:57.240> been<00:01:57.360> done<00:01:57.659> by

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
it original has it already been done by

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870 
it original has it already been done by
someone<00:01:58.200> else<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.710> nope<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> know

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
someone else well nope not that I know

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.999 
someone else well nope not that I know
of<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.719> second<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.530> hold<00:02:01.710> enough

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of and the second does it hold enough

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
of and the second does it hold enough
value<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> entertaining<00:02:03.509> or<00:02:03.780> informative

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
value is it entertaining or informative

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
value is it entertaining or informative
enough<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> video<00:02:05.700> should<00:02:05.939> either

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
enough because the video should either

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789 
enough because the video should either
be<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.750> both<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.020> those<00:02:07.500> things

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
be one or both of those things

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.949 
be one or both of those things
entertaining<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.789> informative<00:02:08.970> otherwise<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
entertaining or informative otherwise I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.479 
entertaining or informative otherwise I
don't<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.200> why<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:10.770> bother<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.129> put

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
don't know why you would bother to put

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.200 
don't know why you would bother to put
it<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> end

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
it on the end

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.150 
it on the end
it<00:02:12.390> also<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.990> video<00:02:13.200> idea<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.680> fit<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
it also of a video idea can fit into a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.040 
it also of a video idea can fit into a
couple<00:02:14.550> tweets<00:02:14.730> I'll<00:02:15.210> just<00:02:15.480> head<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> Twitter

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
couple tweets I'll just head to Twitter

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.630 
couple tweets I'll just head to Twitter
and<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.040> waste<00:02:17.310> everyone's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and do that and not waste everyone's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.240 
and do that and not waste everyone's
time<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> video<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.680> figured

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
time of the video so back then I figured

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880 
time of the video so back then I figured
this<00:02:20.520> isn't<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.180> enough<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.290> tip<00:02:22.560> who

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
this isn't really enough of a tip who

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
this isn't really enough of a tip who
cares<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.520> scan<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> care<00:02:24.030> package<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
cares you can scan a care package to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.200 
cares you can scan a care package to
detect<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.990> trap<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:26.100> super<00:02:26.490> simple<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
detect a trap it was super simple and a

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.850 
detect a trap it was super simple and a
lot<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.420> people<00:02:27.630> probably<00:02:28.050> figured<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> out<00:02:28.680> on

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
lot of people probably figured it out on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.310 
lot of people probably figured it out on
their<00:02:29.160> own<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.490> wasn't<00:02:29.820> too<00:02:29.940> useful<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.600> most

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
their own it wasn't too useful and most

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.530 
their own it wasn't too useful and most
importantly<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.220> used<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.820> be<00:02:32.970> completely

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
importantly it used to be completely

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.270 
importantly it used to be completely
useless<00:02:33.900> knowledge<00:02:34.380> because<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.250> then

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
useless knowledge because back then

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.450 
useless knowledge because back then
until<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.510> second<00:02:37.110> or<00:02:37.200> third<00:02:37.260> game<00:02:37.860> update<00:02:38.310> or

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
until the second or third game update or

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.460 
until the second or third game update or
something<00:02:38.790> like<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.510> could<00:02:39.720> survive<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
something like that you could survive a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.830 
something like that you could survive a

yep<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:43.740> take<00:02:43.920> absolutely<00:02:44.610> no<00:02:44.760> damage

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
yep you would take absolutely no damage

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.810 
yep you would take absolutely no damage
from<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.960> explosion<00:02:46.100> simply<00:02:47.100> by<00:02:47.250> lying<00:02:47.730> down

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
from the explosion simply by lying down

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.900 
from the explosion simply by lying down
so<00:02:48.420> who<00:02:48.990> would<00:02:49.200> care<00:02:49.440> about<00:02:49.710> my<00:02:49.890> little<00:02:50.340> tip<00:02:50.700> if

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
so who would care about my little tip if

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.430 
so who would care about my little tip if
you<00:02:51.000> could<00:02:51.210> survive<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.660> anyway<00:02:51.960> just<00:02:52.230> by

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
you could survive it anyway just by

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.560 
you could survive it anyway just by
lying<00:02:52.680> down<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.490> decided<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.180> wasn't

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
lying down so I decided that it wasn't

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.910 
lying down so I decided that it wasn't
worth<00:02:54.690> anyone's<00:02:55.050> time<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.410> never<00:02:55.560> made<00:02:55.770> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
worth anyone's time and I never made the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.360 
worth anyone's time and I never made the
video<00:02:56.130> until<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.960> what<00:02:58.710> changed<00:02:59.160> well

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
video until now so what changed well

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
video until now so what changed well
number<00:02:59.640> one<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.180> update<00:03:00.510> somewhere

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
number one and that update somewhere

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.360 
number one and that update somewhere
along<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.140> road<00:03:01.260> did<00:03:01.530> make<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> fix<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.250> that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
along the road did make the fix so that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.770 
along the road did make the fix so that
you're<00:03:02.490> no<00:03:02.640> longer<00:03:03.030> protected<00:03:03.420> by<00:03:03.480> being

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you're no longer protected by being

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.110 
you're no longer protected by being
prone<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.440> care<00:03:04.740> package<00:03:05.070> explosion<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.790> now

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
prone the care package explosion is now

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
prone the care package explosion is now
very<00:03:06.630> massive<00:03:07.020> very<00:03:07.410> deadly<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:08.010> very

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
very massive very deadly and very

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.300 
very massive very deadly and very
difficult<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.510> escape<00:03:09.840> even<00:03:10.050> with<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.410> quick<00:03:10.860> XO

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
difficult to escape even with a quick XO

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.130 
difficult to escape even with a quick XO
boost<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.730> basically<00:03:12.180> need<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.600> get<00:03:12.810> around

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
boost you basically need to get around

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.320 
boost you basically need to get around
an<00:03:13.350> object<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.860> be<00:03:14.010> able<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.340> survive<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.300> only

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
an object to be able to survive the only

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.660 
an object to be able to survive the only
other<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> know<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.320> easily<00:03:17.040> survive<00:03:17.430> is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
other way I know to easily survive is

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.340 
other way I know to easily survive is
with<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.150> shield<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.080> can<00:03:19.200> see<00:03:19.320> I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
with the shield as you can see I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.840 
with the shield as you can see I
basically<00:03:19.830> know<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> trap<00:03:20.730> because

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
basically know this is a trap because

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.120 
basically know this is a trap because
the<00:03:21.120> enemy<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.570> called<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.080> warbird<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:22.980> I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
the enemy just called in a warbird but I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.980 
the enemy just called in a warbird but I
know<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.670> take<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.000> safely<00:03:24.270> because<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.840> have

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
know I can take it safely because I have

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.170 
know I can take it safely because I have
the<00:03:25.140> shield<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.890> honestly<00:03:26.250> who<00:03:26.550> uses<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
the shield but honestly who uses the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.690 
the shield but honestly who uses the
shield<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:28.020> game<00:03:28.230> yeah<00:03:28.800> anyway<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.550> tip

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
shield in this game yeah anyway the tip

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
shield in this game yeah anyway the tip
gained<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.000> bit<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.240> usefulness<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:31.110> when

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
gained a bit of usefulness there when

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.020 
gained a bit of usefulness there when
the<00:03:31.440> prone<00:03:31.680> thing<00:03:31.920> was<00:03:32.070> patched<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.700> still

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the prone thing was patched but still

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.880 
the prone thing was patched but still
not<00:03:33.210> worth<00:03:33.420> making<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:34.020> video<00:03:34.320> for<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.770> who

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
not worth making a video for it who

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.470 
not worth making a video for it who
wants<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> little<00:03:35.400> tip<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:36.090> couple

hopefully boosted both the entertainment
value<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.570> little<00:03:48.930> bit<00:03:49.080> at<00:03:49.230> least<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.560> me<00:03:49.650> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.320 
thought it was funny and it boosted the
informative<00:03:52.530> part<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.100> my<00:03:53.280> mind<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.910> made<00:03:54.150> me

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
informative part in my mind it made me

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.530 
informative part in my mind it made me
think<00:03:54.540> oh<00:03:55.190> maybe<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.490> information<00:03:57.210> will<00:03:57.510> be

new<00:03:57.960> for<00:03:57.990> some<00:03:58.440> people<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:58.980> guess<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.400> shouldn't

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
new for some people I guess I shouldn't

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.570 
new for some people I guess I shouldn't
assume<00:04:00.090> everyone<00:04:00.780> knows<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.980> was<00:04:02.550> just

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
assume everyone knows this so I was just

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.670 
assume everyone knows this so I was just
strolling<00:04:03.030> along<00:04:03.300> planes<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.020> domination<00:04:04.440> on

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
strolling along planes and domination on

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.470 
strolling along planes and domination on
Detroit<00:04:05.070> when<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> couple<00:04:05.880> unguarded

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
Detroit when I see a couple unguarded

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.390 
Detroit when I see a couple unguarded
enemy<00:04:06.720> care<00:04:06.930> packages<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.830> head<00:04:08.130> over<00:04:08.160> to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
enemy care packages so I head over to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220 
enemy care packages so I head over to
give<00:04:08.580> them<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.820> quick<00:04:08.940> scan<00:04:09.270> I<00:04:09.510> suspected<00:04:10.020> they

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
give them a quick scan I suspected they

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900 
give them a quick scan I suspected they
were<00:04:10.290> both<00:04:10.650> traps<00:04:11.100> because<00:04:11.550> there<00:04:11.730> were<00:04:11.880> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
were both traps because there were a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.880 
were both traps because there were a
couple<00:04:12.180> enemies<00:04:12.660> controlling<00:04:13.200> scorestreaks

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
couple enemies controlling scorestreaks

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.680 
couple enemies controlling scorestreaks
back<00:04:14.130> here<00:04:14.460> and<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> care<00:04:14.970> packages<00:04:15.420> weren't

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
back here and the care packages weren't

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.660 
back here and the care packages weren't
exactly<00:04:16.109> being<00:04:16.320> contested<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.430> fought<00:04:17.640> over

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
exactly being contested and fought over

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.820 
exactly being contested and fought over
they<00:04:18.390> had<00:04:18.510> been<00:04:18.660> left<00:04:18.840> alone<00:04:19.020> for<00:04:19.380> quite<00:04:19.590> some

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
they had been left alone for quite some

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.090 
they had been left alone for quite some
time

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
time

stats<00:05:54.910> and<00:05:55.180> stuff<00:05:55.240> like<00:05:55.510> that<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:55.900> if<00:05:56.260> you

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
stats and stuff like that so if you

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.200 
stats and stuff like that so if you
don't<00:05:56.740> want<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:56.979> do<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.220> ton<00:05:57.490> of<00:05:57.520> research<00:05:57.910> into

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
don't want to do a ton of research into

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.760 
don't want to do a ton of research into
the<00:05:58.330> stats<00:05:58.600> yourself<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.200> can<00:05:59.350> look<00:05:59.500> at<00:05:59.620> this

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
the stats yourself you can look at this

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.800 
the stats yourself you can look at this
spreadsheet<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.400> know<00:06:00.910> what<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.479> should<00:06:01.690> be

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
spreadsheet and know what you should be

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.390 
spreadsheet and know what you should be
using<00:06:02.050> what<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:02.590> should<00:06:02.770> be<00:06:02.889> keeping<00:06:03.220> and

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
using what you should be keeping and

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.070 
using what you should be keeping and
what<00:06:03.550> you<00:06:03.669> should<00:06:03.850> just<00:06:04.000> be<00:06:04.150> selling<00:06:04.539> for<00:06:04.750> XP

what you should just be selling for XP

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.960 
what you should just be selling for XP
cuz<00:06:05.289> it's<00:06:05.440> worse<00:06:05.620> than<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.950> base<00:06:06.070> variant<00:06:06.370> so

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
cuz it's worse than the base variant so

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.879 
cuz it's worse than the base variant so
that<00:06:07.389> is<00:06:07.630> something<00:06:07.930> I'd<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.350> to<00:06:08.500> get<00:06:08.620> going
