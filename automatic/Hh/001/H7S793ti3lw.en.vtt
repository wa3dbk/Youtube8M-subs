00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
wha because that you utilize the rhythm

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.520 
wha because that you utilize the rhythm
mode<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.010> effects<00:00:35.399> unit<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.170> filter

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
mode on your effects unit and the filter

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.330 
mode on your effects unit and the filter
to<00:00:38.190> make<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> were<00:00:38.610> sort<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> sound<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:40.340> i've

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to make the were sort of sound so i've

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090 
to make the were sort of sound so i've
got<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.570> beat<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.500> tightened

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
got a beat here that I've just tightened

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.970 
got a beat here that I've just tightened
up<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.760> make<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.000> drum<00:00:45.270> sound<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:49.500> works<00:00:49.739> best

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
up to make that drum sound it works best

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.049 
up to make that drum sound it works best
with<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> sort<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> drum<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> should

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
with that sort of drum so you should

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.049 
with that sort of drum so you should
always<00:00:51.210> try<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> capture<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> noise<00:00:52.440> first

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
always try and capture that noise first

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
always try and capture that noise first
then<00:00:54.059> I've<00:00:54.180> got<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.680> truck<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:55.980> what

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.130 
then I've got the truck over here what
I'm<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.480> tap<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> rhythm

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
I'm going to do is just tap in a rhythm

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
I'm going to do is just tap in a rhythm
on<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> you'll<00:00:59.010> hear<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> Wow<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.820> here

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:25.700 
on there and you'll hear it Wow so here
we<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:08.000> that's<00:01:09.000> right

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:47.429 

well<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.520> also<00:01:45.670> works<00:01:46.000> really<00:01:46.209> well<00:01:46.450> with

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
well it also works really well with

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.229 
well it also works really well with
other<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.829> other<00:01:48.280> effects<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:48.819> here<00:01:48.970> as<00:01:49.090> well

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.239 
other the other effects on here as well

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.609 
other the other effects on here as well
so<00:01:49.299> obviously<00:01:49.840> your<00:01:50.020> rhythm<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.319> always<00:01:50.500> going

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
so obviously your rhythm is always going

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.979 
so obviously your rhythm is always going
to<00:01:50.709> stay<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:50.920> tight<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.420> can<00:01:52.539> you<00:01:52.840> can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
to stay in tight but you can you can

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.179 
to stay in tight but you can you can
jump<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.319> about<00:01:53.469> across<00:01:53.739> the<00:01:53.890> effects

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
jump it about across the effects

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:07.289 
jump it about across the effects
parameters<00:01:54.640> so<00:02:05.610> awesome<00:02:06.610> transponder<00:02:07.209> as

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
parameters so awesome transponder as

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:32.580 
parameters so awesome transponder as
well

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.770 

that's<00:02:33.010> what

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that's what

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.810 
that's what
