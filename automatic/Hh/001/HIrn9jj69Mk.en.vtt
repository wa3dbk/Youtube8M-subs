00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.069
 the climate in the robotics laboratory of 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.379
 ufla ran all through the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 the Trojan group that is formed by 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 26 students from various 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
 university here 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 work began six months 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.510
 first step on the computer has the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 design and design of machines 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 the first comes the design of the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 you need and from there you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 discuss with others the other members 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.369
 of the team starts from drawing that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 in the beginning in the hand 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.600
 drawing by hand, seeing the first 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 lines the first design sketches of the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.390
 robot and then moving on to the software 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.059
 in 3 vejÃ¡ and drawing the pieces already a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.120
 of the more detailed specific views 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 to outsource the making of parts 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 here in the same lab 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
 then it's time to reach out 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 robot building equipment 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.860
 is also done at the university and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.260
 own students in the part of the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.020
 we select several products in the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 part of the project and select to see which 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 are more economically viable 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.299
 but most of the time I try to use 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 recyclable materials is already 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.740
 enabling our design and picks us 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.180
 matter the raw material and comes 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 developing and even reaching our 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 burgh 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 After all, it 's time to test. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.360
 robots the test is paramount because 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 theft fails 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.570
 before the competition we can 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.409
 correct on time and have no 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.570
 problem 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.509
 we will work to correct and improve 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 it optimizes if the problem comes in a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 At the moment of the competition we will end 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.570
 losing the test is one of the steps 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.210
 more important for us to see what 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.579
 remained is the difference between the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.049
 the conceived 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.450
 the competition is divided into two 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.509
 modalities the tests are in an arena 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.040
 How's that at the sumo robot works alone? 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.630
 through the sensors 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.270
 he has to send the opponent to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.610
 off the white line at training time. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.520
 stone plays the opponent's role to another 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.469
 Proof is the combat duel is within a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.869
 arena of nine square meters the two 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.840
 two robots face faces a 3 round 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.210
 minutes and who can mobilize the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 another one wins if none mobilizes the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.649
 other the judge's position 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.120
 the ufla team participates in the championship 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.120
 for the third time
