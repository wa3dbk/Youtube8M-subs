forever but the damage they could do

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.920 
forever but the damage they could do
could<00:03:52.350> switch<00:03:52.650> off<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.980> Sun<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.550> have<00:03:54.420> got<00:03:54.750> to

even blink blink and you're dead they

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.150 
even blink blink and you're dead they
are<00:04:18.780> fast<00:04:19.140> faster<00:04:19.770> than<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:19.950> could<00:04:20.100> believe
