00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the fiberglass on it doesn't dry because

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
the fiberglass on it doesn't dry because

true<00:05:13.819> we<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.750> all<00:05:14.990> do<00:05:15.319> this<00:05:15.379> is<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.860> there's<00:05:16.159> no

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
true we can all do this is it there's no

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.119 
true we can all do this is it there's no
water<00:05:16.520> coming<00:05:16.639> in<00:05:17.000> no<00:05:17.650> well<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.800> was<00:05:18.919> really

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
water coming in no well it was really

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.939 
water coming in no well it was really
quick<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.669> make<00:05:19.819> -<00:05:20.150> really<00:05:21.139> like<00:05:21.289> amazingly

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
quick to make - really like amazingly

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:30.999 
quick to make - really like amazingly
fast<00:05:28.539> all<00:05:29.539> right<00:05:29.659> there<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:29.900> go<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:30.800> think

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
fast all right there you go so I think

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.240 
fast all right there you go so I think
the<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.550> moral<00:05:31.909> of<00:05:31.939> that<00:05:32.029> is<00:05:32.449> that<00:05:33.069> go<00:05:34.069> out<00:05:34.219> and

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
the the moral of that is that go out and

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.640 
the the moral of that is that go out and
try<00:05:34.520> stuff<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:35.029> might<00:05:35.360> not<00:05:35.569> work<00:05:35.810> as<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.409> does

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
try stuff it might not work as this does

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.230 
try stuff it might not work as this does
but<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:36.889> was<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:37.009> total<00:05:37.370> blast<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:37.939> don't<00:05:38.150> be

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
but it was a total blast so don't be

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.600 
but it was a total blast so don't be
afraid<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.479> try<00:05:38.750> things<00:05:39.069> you<00:05:40.069> know<00:05:40.159> what<00:05:40.400> can

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
afraid to try things you know what can

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.129 
afraid to try things you know what can
go<00:05:40.759> wrong<00:05:40.939> might<00:05:41.240> go<00:05:41.419> wrong<00:05:41.599> and<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:41.899> did<00:05:42.050> in

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
go wrong might go wrong and it did in

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.570

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
is you need extra hands to do it and

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.589 
is you need extra hands to do it and
