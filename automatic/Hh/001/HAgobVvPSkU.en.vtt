I'll put a link in the description below

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.810 
I'll put a link in the description below
it's<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.610> w<00:00:45.940> w<00:00:46.210> DB<00:00:46.900> link<00:00:47.290> net<00:00:47.860> that's<00:00:48.550> their

it's a w w DB link net that's their

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.880 
it's a w w DB link net that's their
website<00:00:49.269> here<00:00:49.570> I'm<00:00:50.019> an<00:00:50.140> inside<00:00:50.470> guys<00:00:50.650> like<00:00:50.830> I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
website here I'm an inside guys like I

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.009 
website here I'm an inside guys like I
said<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.460> an<00:00:51.610> AML<00:00:52.030> style<00:00:52.360> fuse<00:00:52.659> holder

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
said this is an AML style fuse holder

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.500 
said this is an AML style fuse holder
you're<00:00:53.769> gonna<00:00:53.860> have<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.100> single<00:00:54.790> power<00:00:54.970> input

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
you're gonna have a single power input

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.740 
you're gonna have a single power input
in<00:00:55.690> here<00:00:56.460> another<00:00:57.460> power<00:00:57.790> out<00:00:58.030> output<00:00:58.629> in

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
in here another power out output in

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.969 
in here another power out output in
there<00:00:58.930> so<00:00:59.199> basically<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.589> got<00:00:59.680> your<00:00:59.800> power

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
there so basically you got your power

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.060 
there so basically you got your power
wire<00:01:00.159> going<00:01:00.400> in<00:01:00.699> power<00:01:01.690> wire<00:01:01.989> going<00:01:02.260> out<00:01:02.589> this

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
wire going in power wire going out this

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.070 
wire going in power wire going out this
uses<00:01:03.489> actually<00:01:03.820> guys<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.269> ring<00:01:04.750> style

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
uses actually guys the ring style

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.990 
uses actually guys the ring style
connectors<00:01:05.950> up<00:01:06.159> top<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.430> if<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:06.820> guys<00:01:06.940> are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
connectors up top so if you guys are

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.990 
connectors up top so if you guys are
installing<00:01:07.570> rings<00:01:07.990> with<00:01:08.740> your<00:01:08.920> setup<00:01:09.190> for

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
installing rings with your setup for

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300 
installing rings with your setup for
example<00:01:10.450> like<00:01:11.049> I<00:01:11.229> am<00:01:11.409> here<00:01:11.680> will<00:01:11.860> take<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.040> ring

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
example like I am here will take a ring

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.359 
example like I am here will take a ring
here<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:14.110> would<00:01:14.259> go<00:01:14.350> there<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:15.100> would<00:01:15.250> have

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
here that would go there we would have

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.510 
here that would go there we would have
our<00:01:15.520> fuse<00:01:15.820> in<00:01:16.000> between<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.659> then<00:01:17.259> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
our fuse in between and then the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.100 
our fuse in between and then the
connector<00:01:18.520> goes<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.880> top<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.329> this<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.570> cap

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
connector goes on top and this is a cap

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.870 
connector goes on top and this is a cap
that<00:01:20.320> protects<00:01:20.740> your<00:01:20.890> wiring<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.369> your<00:01:21.549> fuse

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
that protects your wiring and your fuse

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.080 
that protects your wiring and your fuse
so<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:23.320> like<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.770> said<00:01:23.799> guys<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.579> a<00:01:24.880> and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
so these like I said guys is the a and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.080 
so these like I said guys is the a and
now<00:01:25.180> style<00:01:25.570> fusing<00:01:26.140> these<00:01:26.799> are<00:01:27.009> al<00:01:27.430> fuses<00:01:27.909> got

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
now style fusing these are al fuses got

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.179 
now style fusing these are al fuses got
the<00:01:28.210> little<00:01:28.329> tabs<00:01:28.659> there<00:01:28.990> once<00:01:29.799> we<00:01:29.950> get<00:01:30.039> this

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
the little tabs there once we get this

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.099 
the little tabs there once we get this
out<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.460> package<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:31.270> would<00:01:31.750> simply

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
out of the package that would simply

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.260 
out of the package that would simply
just<00:01:32.320> go<00:01:32.469> in<00:01:32.590> there<00:01:32.740> click<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.549> you've<00:01:34.119> got

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
just go in there click and you've got

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.010 
just go in there click and you've got
your<00:01:34.450> fuse<00:01:34.719> protections<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:37.509> case<00:01:37.750> goes

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
your fuse protections so this case goes

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.590 
your fuse protections so this case goes
on<00:01:38.170> there<00:01:38.469> like<00:01:38.649> I<00:01:38.679> said<00:01:38.710> these<00:01:39.009> use<00:01:39.219> a<00:01:39.600> non

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
on there like I said these use a non

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.139 
on there like I said these use a non
corrosive<00:01:40.960> conductors<00:01:41.770> here<00:01:42.100> these<00:01:42.969> are<00:01:43.119> just

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
corrosive conductors here these are just

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.849 
corrosive conductors here these are just
set<00:01:43.479> screws<00:01:43.869> they've<00:01:44.140> got<00:01:44.320> little<00:01:44.560> lock
