00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.419 

here's<00:00:00.930> what<00:00:01.199> was<00:00:01.319> drawing<00:00:01.680> on<00:00:01.770> me<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.979> final

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
here's what was drawing on me the final

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.990 
here's what was drawing on me the final
video<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.480> series<00:00:04.020> but<00:00:04.410> um<00:00:04.589> I'm<00:00:05.580> pretty

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
video for this series but um I'm pretty

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.820 
video for this series but um I'm pretty
tired<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.839> just<00:00:07.109> gonna<00:00:07.230> let<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.649> video

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
tired so I'm just gonna let the video

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.419 
tired so I'm just gonna let the video
play<00:00:08.040> through<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.650> fourth<00:00:10.650> update<00:00:11.190> and

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
play through it is a fourth update and

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.539 
play through it is a fourth update and
like<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.240> third<00:00:12.480> video<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.960> think<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
like the third video I think on the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
like the third video I think on the
Kickstarter<00:00:15.150> page<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.080> shows<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> little

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
Kickstarter page and it shows a little

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.099 
Kickstarter page and it shows a little
bit<00:00:17.130> more<00:00:17.160> actual<00:00:17.970> gameplay<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.779> time<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
bit more actual gameplay this time and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.960 
bit more actual gameplay this time and
also<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> video<00:00:22.529> played<00:00:22.830> out

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.640 

hey<00:00:29.970> guys<00:00:30.179> final<00:00:30.630> days<00:00:30.779> Antigua<00:00:31.109> starter<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

much<00:00:43.129> now<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> show<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.360> kind

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
much now I'm going to show you some kind

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
much now I'm going to show you some kind
of<00:00:45.809> gameplay<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.230> order<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> explain<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> more

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
of gameplay in order to explain you more

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.959 
of gameplay in order to explain you more
about<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> development<00:00:47.879> stage<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.879> we

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
about the development stage so here we

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.350 
about the development stage so here we
go

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
go

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
go
we<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:51.930> working<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> bike<00:00:52.890> physics

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
we are working a lot on the bike physics

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
we are working a lot on the bike physics
and<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.910> already<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.539> physics<00:00:54.870> system<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and we already have a physics system it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
and we already have a physics system it
allows<00:00:56.070> freaky<00:00:56.460> bike<00:00:56.610> behavior<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> real

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
allows freaky bike behavior in the real

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
allows freaky bike behavior in the real
time<00:00:57.690> our<00:00:58.680> aim<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> getting<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> realistic

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
time our aim is getting a realistic

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
time our aim is getting a realistic
physics<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.960> drives<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> animations<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
physics that drives the animations and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.870 
physics that drives the animations and
this<00:01:02.670> means<00:01:02.850> realism<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.539> natural<00:01:03.960> movements

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
this means realism and natural movements

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
this means realism and natural movements
notice<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> nano<00:01:06.750> development

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
notice that we are on a nano development

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.920 
notice that we are on a nano development
stage<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.939> work<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.510> progress

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
stage and all these is work on progress

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
stage and all these is work on progress
so<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.590> plenty<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.010> bugs<00:01:11.340> leeches<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so there are plenty of bugs leeches and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.080 
so there are plenty of bugs leeches and
stuff<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> fix<00:01:13.040> not<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.460> physics<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
stuff to fix not just about physics and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210 
stuff to fix not just about physics and
talking<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.900> graphics<00:01:16.290> field<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
talking about the graphics field and we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
talking about the graphics field and we
have<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> large<00:01:17.729> list<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.570> things<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.080> develop

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
have a large list with things to develop

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
have a large list with things to develop
and<00:01:19.680> improve<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and improve you know when we get the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
and improve you know when we get the
funds<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.990> keep<00:01:22.259> developing<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.790> will

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
funds to keep developing then we will

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
funds to keep developing then we will
need<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.330> eight<00:01:24.659> months<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.110> work<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
need about eight months of work to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.580 
need about eight months of work to
release<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.689> that's<00:01:27.689> why<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.049> need<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> fund

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
release again that's why we need to fund

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
release again that's why we need to fund
we<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> keep<00:01:29.520> working<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> have

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
we need to keep working on what we have

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
we need to keep working on what we have
done<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.710> team<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.130> five

done but we are little team with five
people<00:01:32.610> involved<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.509> need<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> earn<00:01:33.869> two

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
people involved and we need to earn two

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
in addition there are a lot of bills and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580 
in addition there are a lot of bills and
licenses<00:01:38.420> now<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.600> time<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> support<00:01:40.320> me<00:01:40.469> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
licenses now it's time to support me and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:02:06.680 
licenses now it's time to support me and
makes<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> game

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.820 

you

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.610 

but<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.620> I'm

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
but that is it for this one and I'm

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.260 
but that is it for this one and I'm
assuming<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> game<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.550> come<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:17.850> from

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
assuming the game will come out from

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.180 
assuming the game will come out from
what<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.540> understand<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:19.980> reach

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
what I understand if they do not reach

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.470 
what I understand if they do not reach
the<00:02:20.990> 55,000<00:02:21.990> pounds<00:02:22.260> mark<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.730> game<00:02:24.060> will<00:02:24.330> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the 55,000 pounds mark the game will be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
the 55,000 pounds mark the game will be
canceled<00:02:24.960> which<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> make<00:02:27.260> 27<00:02:28.340> 331
