00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.719
 because she said "very special game" Salih had to go 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 Guests will be welcomed by Sascha Kirschstein 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.889
 Union in 4 4 2 with a diamond in midfield from there is initially too 

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:32.860
 the biggest danger 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.930
 again Torsten Mattuschka 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.330
 again Michael Parensen 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
 the game only runs a clearing 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 Kirschstein does not like that at all 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.710
 his team dares to cross the middle line in the 14th minute 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.620
 whose 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.790
 who prevails against Mixed Madouni 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.620
 Christian Stuff sleeps in the middle 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.450
 the 0 2 1 by Moritz Hartmann 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.540
 reversed world at the old forestry 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.720
 Union has the game under control with their first ever attack 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.720
 Team of Benno MÃ¶hlmann in the lead 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.580
 the Berliners react 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.840
 accordingly should 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.250
 Christian Stuff later made good mistakes by mistake 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 Relief among the 15 thousand in the ranks 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.030
 because pragmatic the free kick center-back fabric its one with 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 one optimally used 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.670
 after all, to a tenant of the vulture 90 Markus Karl measures such 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.100
 Standard situations with forward comes then otherwise only sixth 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340
 Vacuum cleaner to play before the defense 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.310
 the first little demanded at this stage that happens almost happens 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 help only in the industry 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 this excitement 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.230
 but no penalty because Barbara hit the ball and not Christopher's foot 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.760
 Quiring hits 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.630
 Madouni 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.630
 the post is the Berlin leadership 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.419
 completed half an hour 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.710
 Patrick Kohlmann 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.909
 "With a long ball on Mattuschka 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.099
 Mattuschka 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.669
 Silvio 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.669
 he is a spectacular hit 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.629
 the Brazilian with his application for the goal of the month that half 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.310
 but on the cap of today towering Torsten Mattuschka goes 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.819
 a freshly fried again partly after the 2 2 1 that is at the same time 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.419
 Half Result 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.699
 after the break Union gives immediately full throttle again 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.630
 Mattuschka are always Mattuschka double pass with 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.579
 and this time it's the captain himself 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.579
 the 3 2 1 in the 49 min 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.129
 also Markus Karl 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.529
 until the preliminary decision 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.529
 in this game 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.199
 the double pass not just schools 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.729
 just through David this gate 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.099
 the compass 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.469
 in Neustadt shocked Union now from Konter attitude with further 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.529
 high-profile opportunities 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.529
 the substitute Patrick Zoundi 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.839
 his first touch of the ball 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.939
 Biliskov rescued the bullet-ready Michael Parensen 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:45.179
 that's why witnesses would have been able to try it themselves 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.410
 rarely have the fans in the Wuhlheide 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.850
 a convincing not only combative but also playful that Union 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.059
 Team seen 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.059
 Wade's substitute also Silvio 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.859
 makes the price approx 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.699
 After Pascal comforts some ex-colleagues for the PID is a very bitter one 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.569
 Lesson the 4 2 1 with 85 minutes and that does not have to be the final point 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.959
 his 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.509
 the Berlin as unleashed Silvio Simon Terodde 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.039
 Here's the clearest chance for Michael Parensen's Wars 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.569
 first FC Union wins even at this level earned with 4 2 1 maybe on 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.599
 PALMERT optimally prepared for the opponent thanks to the insider knowledge as 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.599
 New arrival from Bavaria 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.689
 when we find each other 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.129
 Sneezing and coughing 4 points 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.479
 Although not affected by this point of view, they must 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.389
 to get through and with many operated opponents you get 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.169
 relentlessly meaning 50 000 people have come to the area 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.680
 Services Vilbeler points 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.310
 because the company in turn reads that the STA 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.659
 essentially 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.419
 Nef 0 English he sees you 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.689
 I am my 18 so they play the soothing in the last nine 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.470
 we marched this tip for 90 minutes and took b to say 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.909
 where do not put them where 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.330
 The next opportunity to do so already on the next Saturday at 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.099
 Guest performance in Duisburg 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.080
 yes, but she of it
