00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
all if you don't know what I affinity is

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.710 
all if you don't know what I affinity is
I<00:01:03.830> affinity<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.280> when<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.670> take<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.150> screen<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
I affinity is when you take the screen a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.950 
I affinity is when you take the screen a
native<00:01:06.049> screen<00:01:06.440> resolution<00:01:07.010> from<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:07.430> screen

native screen resolution from one screen

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.530 
native screen resolution from one screen
and<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.200> spread<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.650> across<00:01:09.920> three<00:01:10.820> or<00:01:11.060> more

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540

and you spread it across three or more
you<00:01:11.750> can<00:01:11.840> even<00:01:12.080> do<00:01:12.170> too<00:01:12.409> but<00:01:13.010> everything

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
you can even do too but everything

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.620 
you can even do too but everything

no<00:02:04.939> idea<00:02:05.210> why<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.749> bought<00:02:06.590> all<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.950> adapters

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
no idea why I bought all the adapters

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
no idea why I bought all the adapters
for<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.759> everything<00:02:08.210> like<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.410> um

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
for it everything like that and then um

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.160 
for it everything like that and then um
I<00:02:09.950> read<00:02:10.220> online<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.819> need<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.280 
port i bought was from inland and it
costs<00:02:37.420> around<00:02:37.569> ten<00:02:37.930> dollars<00:02:38.260> from

costs around ten dollars from
microcenter<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.430> patterson<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:41.260> it'll

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
microcenter in patterson and what it'll

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.220 
microcenter in patterson and what it'll
do<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.709> it'll<00:02:41.980> take<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.819> vga<00:02:43.239> or<00:02:43.300> DVI<00:02:43.420> signal<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
do is it'll take a vga or DVI signal and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.350 
do is it'll take a vga or DVI signal and
it'll<00:02:44.440> converted<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.069> DisplayPort<00:02:45.940> single

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it'll converted to a DisplayPort single

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080 
it'll converted to a DisplayPort single
but<00:02:47.310> apparently<00:02:48.310> computers<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
but apparently computers have the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.089 
but apparently computers have the
ability<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.480> know<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.230> still<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.470> VGA

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
ability to know that it is still a VGA

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.550 
ability to know that it is still a VGA
so<00:02:52.060> after<00:02:52.450> you've<00:02:52.569> hooked<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.900> up<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.140> was<00:02:53.379> still

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
so after you've hooked it up I was still

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.140 
so after you've hooked it up I was still
having<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.890> same<00:02:54.129> issues<00:02:54.610> even<00:02:54.879> though<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> was

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
having the same issues even though I was

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.140 
having the same issues even though I was
using<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.450> DisplayPort<00:02:56.260> what<00:02:57.160> happens<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
using a DisplayPort what happens is it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.710 
using a DisplayPort what happens is it
knew<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> VGA<00:02:59.910> next<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.090> did<00:03:01.510> some

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
knew that it was a VGA next I did some

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.809 
knew that it was a VGA next I did some
further<00:03:01.900> research<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.590> then<00:03:02.799> they<00:03:03.519> talked

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
further research and then they talked

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.600 
further research and then they talked
about<00:03:03.940> active<00:03:04.569> display<00:03:05.079> ports<00:03:05.530> which<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:06.040> from

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
about active display ports which I from

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.300 
about active display ports which I from
what<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.819> gather<00:03:07.150> will<00:03:07.690> take<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.500> signal<00:03:09.069> from

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
what I gather will take the signal from

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.270 
what I gather will take the signal from
our<00:03:09.610> vga<00:03:10.120> or<00:03:10.239> DVI<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.410> little<00:03:11.620> trick<00:03:11.950> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
our vga or DVI and a little trick the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.039 
our vga or DVI and a little trick the
graphics<00:03:12.489> are<00:03:12.730> into<00:03:13.090> thinking<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.540> actually

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
graphics are into thinking it's actually

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.470

ridiculous<00:03:20.440> for<00:03:20.860> 20<00:03:21.069> inches<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.599> couldn't

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
ridiculous for 20 inches so I couldn't

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.930 
ridiculous for 20 inches so I couldn't

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
find an active display port so what i

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.539 
find an active display port so what i
did<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.180> i<00:03:25.540> figured<00:03:25.870> i<00:03:26.110> would<00:03:26.380> go<00:03:26.560> buy<00:03:26.709> an<00:03:26.950> apple

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
did is i figured i would go buy an apple

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.849 
did is i figured i would go buy an apple
displayport<00:03:28.450> adapter<00:03:28.720> thinking<00:03:29.380> apple<00:03:29.739> is

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
displayport adapter thinking apple is

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.979 
displayport adapter thinking apple is
extremely<00:03:30.400> expensive<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.120> they<00:03:31.180> make<00:03:31.420> okay

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
extremely expensive and they make okay

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.930 
extremely expensive and they make okay
things<00:03:32.319> sure<00:03:33.130> enough<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.400> did<00:03:33.730> not<00:03:33.880> work

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
things sure enough that did not work

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.750 
things sure enough that did not work
either<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.569> now<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:35.230> is<00:03:35.350> two<00:03:35.590> trips<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.549> then

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
either so now that is two trips so then

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.990 
either so now that is two trips so then
my<00:03:37.150> third<00:03:37.180> trip<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.959> found<00:03:38.230> one<00:03:38.590> from<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.579> company
