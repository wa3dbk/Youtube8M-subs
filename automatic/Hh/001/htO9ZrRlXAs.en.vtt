 own observations the evolutionary cycle 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.540
 in the Iberian peninsula 'lasts between 2 and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.820
 4 years and even some more if the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.339
 environmental and supply conditions 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.350
 of food were excessively

 third of state in day pauses more or 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.150
 less prolonged larvae reach 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.909
 reach large size before the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.839
 metamorphosis usually understood 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.309
 between 100 and 120 millimeters typical of 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.240
 white worm but big 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.010
 white body dimensions with three pairs 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 of abdominal legs and with the head 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 rhinoceros beetle is brown

 of the rhinoceros beetle eric 3 nancy 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.299
 cornish this insect can stand on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.509
 its back a load 30 times greater than its 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.750
 own weight for one hour measures about 4 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.700
 to 5 centimeters in length its color is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.670
 black have a pair of black wings 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 called Ã©litros which cover the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 yellow and membranous wings that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.020
 they serve to fly the beetle 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.140
 rhinoceros is so named because it has a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.179
 horn in his head like the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.460
 rhinos this horn use it for 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.859
 dig quickly and bury yourself for 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.360
 be able to escape from some danger of 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.360
 some of its predators 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.459
 besides, the males use their horn to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.789
 fight with your opponent and attract the 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.859
 female rhinoceros beetles are 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.109
 considered beneficial within the 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.179
 nature since they feed on 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.179
 decomposing trunks and leaves 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.979
 dry which facilitates the degradation of 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.720
 this organic matter and as 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.329
 consequence is given a quick 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 transformation of these elements into 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.340
 nutrients to make the soil strong
