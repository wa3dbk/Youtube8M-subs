00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
computer or anything like that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.010 
computer or anything like that
and<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.350> uses<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.890> mini<00:02:20.520> USB<00:02:20.700> connection<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
and it uses a mini USB connection to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.810 
and it uses a mini USB connection to
connect<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.560> device<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.220> then<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.580> actually

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
connect to device and then you actually

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.860 
connect to device and then you actually
have<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.600> power<00:02:26.360> connection<00:02:27.360> right<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.660> as

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
have a power connection right here as

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
have a power connection right here as
well<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.410> why<00:02:29.070> do<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.730> power

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
well so why do you have a power

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.820 
well so why do you have a power
connection<00:02:30.440> that's<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.770> question

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
connection that's a really good question

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.770 
connection that's a really good question
the<00:02:32.700> reason<00:02:32.910> why<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.210> have<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.450> power

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the reason why you have a power

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.050 
the reason why you have a power
connection<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.470> because<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.310> your<00:02:35.700> computer

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
connection is because if your computer

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550 
connection is because if your computer
is<00:02:36.120> off<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.660> something<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
is off or something like that and you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.320 
is off or something like that and you
still<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.640> know<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.820> still<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.090> USB

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
still have you know you still have USB

devices that you want to charge or you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
devices that you want to charge or you
want<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> power<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.150> actually<00:02:42.390> connect

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
want to power you can actually connect

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.100 
want to power you can actually connect
the<00:02:43.500> power<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.790> appearing<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.360> use<00:02:45.780> those

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
the power to the appearing and use those

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.030 
the power to the appearing and use those
USB<00:02:47.360> ports<00:02:48.360> as<00:02:48.510> powered<00:02:49.110> USB<00:02:49.290> ports<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.980> you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
USB ports as powered USB ports so if you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.220 
USB ports as powered USB ports so if you
have<00:02:50.130> an<00:02:50.220> iPhone<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> tablet<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:52.140> know

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
something like that that uses USB to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.730 
something like that that uses USB to
charge<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.600> easily<00:02:54.960> charge<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.620> which

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
charge you can easily charge it up which

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.310 
charge you can easily charge it up which
is<00:02:55.860> actually<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> great<00:02:56.550> feature<00:02:56.960> so<00:02:57.960> not<00:02:58.170> only

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
is actually a great feature so not only

so we're going to give ourselves a
little<00:05:06.629> bit<00:05:06.810> more<00:05:06.870> cable<00:05:07.500> here<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.460> a

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
little bit more cable here this is a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.959 
little bit more cable here this is a
little<00:05:09.000> bit<00:05:09.180> more<00:05:10.129> alright<00:05:11.129> so<00:05:11.400> that<00:05:11.580> might

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
little bit more alright so that might

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:12.920 
little bit more alright so that might
have<00:05:12.060> been<00:05:12.120> too<00:05:12.300> much<00:05:12.330> that's<00:05:12.599> actually

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
have been too much that's actually

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.119 
have been too much that's actually
that's<00:05:13.199> actually<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.590> good<00:05:13.680> amount<00:05:13.889> right

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
that's actually a good amount right

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.399 
that's actually a good amount right
there<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.460> now<00:05:14.639> as<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.300> can<00:05:15.569> see<00:05:15.629> there's<00:05:16.139> no

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
there so now as you can see there's no

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.459 
there so now as you can see there's no
drag<00:05:16.800> on<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.400> line<00:05:17.580> whatsoever<00:05:18.419> so<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:19.199> kind

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
drag on the line whatsoever so it kind

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.559 
drag on the line whatsoever so it kind
of<00:05:19.530> feels<00:05:19.770> like<00:05:19.889> I'm<00:05:20.219> using<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.759> wireless<00:05:21.120> mouse

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
of feels like I'm using a wireless mouse

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.939 
of feels like I'm using a wireless mouse
which<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.960> good<00:05:22.110> because<00:05:22.229> I<00:05:22.349> have<00:05:22.469> no<00:05:22.650> drag

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
which is good because I have no drag

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.709 
which is good because I have no drag
that<00:05:23.099> means<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.430> can<00:05:23.550> really<00:05:23.729> concentrate<00:05:23.969> and
