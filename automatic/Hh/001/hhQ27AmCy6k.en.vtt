dead legs until you're taking a look
about<00:00:03.330> five<00:00:03.929> features<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.799> LG<00:00:05.250> g3<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.819> could

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
about five features on the LG g3 I could

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.339 
about five features on the LG g3 I could
go<00:00:06.450> up<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.629> 10<00:00:06.960> or<00:00:06.990> 15<00:00:07.589> or<00:00:07.770> 20<00:00:08.130> or<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.639> ton<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> but

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
go up to 10 or 15 or 20 or a ton of but

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.660 
go up to 10 or 15 or 20 or a ton of but
the<00:00:10.530> video<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.769> gonna<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.950> pretty<00:00:11.070> long<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.550> we

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the video is gonna be pretty long so we

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.100 
the video is gonna be pretty long so we
don't<00:00:11.849> want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:12.750> it'll<00:00:13.080> be

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
don't want to do that because it'll be

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.410 
don't want to do that because it'll be
even<00:00:13.559> longer<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.400> we're<00:00:14.849> looking<00:00:15.000> at<00:00:15.210> five

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
even longer so we're looking at five

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.490 
even longer so we're looking at five
features<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> start<00:00:16.289> off<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
features going to start off with the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.599 
features going to start off with the
display<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.730> 2560<00:00:18.630> x<00:00:18.810> 1440<00:00:19.320> quad<00:00:20.250> HD

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
display which is a 2560 x 1440 quad HD

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.519 
display which is a 2560 x 1440 quad HD
display<00:00:20.810> now<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:21.869> you're<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
display now if you're like me and you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.290 
display now if you're like me and you
keep<00:00:22.680> your<00:00:22.830> display<00:00:23.250> brightness<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.820> well<00:00:24.000> 0

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
keep your display brightness as well 0

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
keep your display brightness as well 0
because<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.869> know<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.410> battery

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because you know you want your battery

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
because you know you want your battery
lasts<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.070> long<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.400> possible<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> could

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
lasts as long as possible and you could

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.640 
lasts as long as possible and you could
just<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> adjusts<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.170> pretty<00:00:28.439> well

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
just see it adjusts like pretty well

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160 
just see it adjusts like pretty well
inside<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.400> represent<00:00:30.050> we're<00:00:31.050> not

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
inside as they represent we're not

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.630 
inside as they represent we're not
really<00:00:31.289> doing<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.650> display<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.189> justice

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
really doing the display into justice

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
really doing the display into justice
because<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.480> looks<00:00:33.660> about<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> same<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
because it looks about the same as it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.220 
because it looks about the same as it
does<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> g2<00:00:35.340> which<00:00:36.030> has<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> 1080p<00:00:36.780> display

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
does on the g2 which has a 1080p display

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.709 
does on the g2 which has a 1080p display
and<00:00:37.440> zero<00:00:38.219> percent<00:00:38.520> brightness<00:00:38.820> let<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.540> put

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and zero percent brightness let me put

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.080 
and zero percent brightness let me put
it<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> 20<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.800> 30<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> case<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it up to like 20 or 30 or in this case I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.479 
it up to like 20 or 30 or in this case I
have<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.600> 50<00:00:42.980> don't<00:00:43.980> look<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.160> whole<00:00:44.430> lot

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
have about 50 don't look a whole lot

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.450 
have about 50 don't look a whole lot
nicer<00:00:44.820> it'll<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.690> amazing<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.890> sharp<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
nicer it'll look amazing so sharp and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
nicer it'll look amazing so sharp and
just<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:48.629> looks<00:00:48.870> amazing<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.559> will

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
just it just looks amazing and it will

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
just it just looks amazing and it will
use<00:00:49.829> more<00:00:50.039> battery<00:00:50.370> obviously<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.660> looks

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
use more battery obviously but it looks

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
use more battery obviously but it looks
so<00:00:52.260> much<00:00:52.379> better<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.879> talking<00:00:54.059> about

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so much better now we're talking about

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
so much better now we're talking about
battery<00:00:54.510> life<00:00:54.590> we'll<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.010> my

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
battery life we'll take a look at my

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
battery life we'll take a look at my
stats<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.489> far<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.879> today<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> we're

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
stats so far for today and we're

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
stats so far for today and we're
checking<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.579> about<00:01:00.649> three<00:01:02.090> 3.25<00:01:03.090> hours

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
checking in at about three 3.25 hours

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
checking in at about three 3.25 hours

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
off the charger and almost an hour of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
off the charger and almost an hour of
on-screen<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.330> 53<00:01:06.659> minutes<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.479> i'll<00:01:10.409> show

on-screen time 53 minutes and i'll show

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
on-screen time 53 minutes and i'll show
you<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.070> image<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:13.250> yesterday<00:01:14.270> that's<00:01:15.270> my

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you a image from yesterday that's my

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850 
you a image from yesterday that's my
screen<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.780> time<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.049> yesterday<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.619> six

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
screen on time from yesterday so six

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.289 
screen on time from yesterday so six
hours<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.400> eight<00:01:17.520> minutes<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.030> was<00:01:18.090> as

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
hours and eight minutes and that was as

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
hours and eight minutes and that was as
represent<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:19.020> day<00:01:19.170> long<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.530> Wi-Fi<00:01:20.009> although

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
represent all day long on Wi-Fi although

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
represent all day long on Wi-Fi although
roaming<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.360> well<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.439> since<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
roaming as well so since this is a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
roaming as well so since this is a
korean<00:01:23.520> version<00:01:23.759> i'm<00:01:24.090> pretty<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.540> it'll<00:01:24.750> be

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
korean version i'm pretty sure it'll be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
korean version i'm pretty sure it'll be
probably<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.470> seven<00:01:26.100> maybe<00:01:26.369> seven<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
probably what seven maybe seven and a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.289 
probably what seven maybe seven and a
half<00:01:26.850> hours<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.200> US<00:01:29.070> g3<00:01:29.729> once<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> gets

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
half hours on the US g3 once that gets

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
half hours on the US g3 once that gets
here<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.689> we'll<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.840> optimized<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.670> US

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
here because we'll be optimized for US

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.910 
here because we'll be optimized for US
carriers<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> networks<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.740> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
carriers and networks thing as this one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
carriers and networks thing as this one
is<00:01:34.950> always<00:01:35.460> roaming<00:01:35.810> as<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.079> probably<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is always roaming as it probably is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.480 
is always roaming as it probably is
right<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.990> if<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:41.310> we're

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
right now as well if it is think we're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
right now as well if it is think we're
on<00:01:41.579> bill<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.229> battery<00:01:43.500> life

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
on bill right now so it's battery life
