00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.919
 let's see how to make this boat 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.980
 this wand embroidery is realized 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.929
 with a square shape sheet that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 we have a sheet of color paper or 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 embroidery and can also be done with a sheet 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 normal paper the result if it is not 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.840
 two-tone this is the important size 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
 in square form and begins to bend 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.210
 take the sheet and explain it in half 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 on one side then also the other I was born 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 let's say the first the second diagonal 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 take that center 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.379
 bring him that center track the same 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 what do you do on the other side the tip la 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 your center draw this line 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 once the track this line 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.550
 reopened and you lean here in such a way 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.079
 that you go again on this line 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 eva again on this the invention 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 arrives strictly to the lines were 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 already for the tracks at this point 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 we fold so we bend like this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 we turn the bottom upside down 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 we take the tip that we bring it water 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 towards the center then we immediately trace 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.430
 let's go to the other side and do the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.049
 same thing 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.320
 let's go the tip the departure towards the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.340
 center and trace the new we open e 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.450
 so let's go for the tip 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.659
 from here it is traced but behind we throw away 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.730
 here 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.210
 and track 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.480
 at this point so they bend 6 is 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.320
 explains so let 's take a lot of bends in 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.320
 mind quality 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.649
 we see 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.250
 and we follow the length tonight 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:50.430
 of our boat we take the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.330
 corners and turn it so the first 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.210
 in the second 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.560
 take the third genova all of them 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.899
 inside third 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.159
 and how much angle they fold up like this 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.189
 inside of 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:12.340
 at this point we will draw a line that 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.340
 goes from here to employing ok like that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.220
 and let's do first 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.870
 in short, second 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 we press into mental strength that one remains 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.830
 track 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.810
 same thing we do on the other side 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 so let's say this is the center here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.400
 where we will go 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.150
 and how strongly we have up to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 get this same thing we do 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 also which 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.200
 from here and here we press strongly 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.150
 until you get this 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.890
 now we have drawn these lines 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.959
 let's see what our situation is 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.640
 we take the tip and bring it here to 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.940
 center we take the community back to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.069
 we bring to the center we press strongly the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.900
 same thing we do on the other 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.940
 part we are really close to 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 end of our boat but a 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.239
 this point is going to happen the real 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.700
 magic because we are going to open the bottom 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.590
 let's open the bottom we see a yes shape of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.410
 boat but the magic and produce the boat 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.769
 not fair but it is on the other side we turn 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.470
 on the other side we turn over with the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.420
 magic of our car 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.349
 we turn it all up we go even a few 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.540
 we turn over and we have ours 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.540
 wand we believe 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:40.290
 we have inside see you down there 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.290
 origami barchetta have fun
