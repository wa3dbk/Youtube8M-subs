00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello my name is jim rumen that is 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.959
 my new monitor thank you all 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.580
 give me some recommendations 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.849
 I especially have written 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 two weeks what you asked me for 144 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.980
 heart or 120 plus heart monitor recommend 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.439
 can and this is the good thing now 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.020
 with me the part is called asus vg 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.029
 278 hp and is a 27 inch monitor 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.740
 whether that is for the individual now 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 gambling makes sense or not in front of everyone 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 That's what first person shooters do 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.519
 quietly you left here I wanted 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.990
 I only just once the part very briefly 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.090
 Imagine me a lot of people 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.469
 meanwhile have written something for 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 it has become a thing now and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.430
 Can you recommend us the part therefore 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.260
 now very short video here from the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 actual good piece recorded with 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 my relatively old now galaxy 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 nexus mobile phone no mr camcorder am 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 start no hd camcorder here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 so it has to live with that thing 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 has 144 heart and that was in principle 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.870
 no my main focus and why me 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.789
 did not benq brought me the lies 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 actually in the first place because of that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.420
 This device is still a speaker here 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.640
 has installed behind or respectively 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 Stereo speaker has the built-in for 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 my taste are relatively heavy bass 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.610
 So they are relatively dull and deep 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.840
 You can find it good especially if 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 it sounds a little louder 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.270
 for nothing relatively good for monitor 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.549
 not to say almost too hard 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 then the monitor has this function here 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 you just go up and up 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 to go down on the part goes very much 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 very simple but has no pivot 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 function so you can not do it now 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.350
 somehow turn 90 degrees and the foot 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.090
 is in principle on such a ner on such a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.369
 disc that means you can complete it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 swing left and right if you can 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.820
 that needs in the background are yes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.110
 even my wall mount that is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.670
 the thing will be sooner or later anyway 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 screwed to the wall that's me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.689
 Need all this knickknacks for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.950
 not really me but for the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.810
 moment will be here again 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.490
 because I'm planning something else and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 Accordingly, I do not need that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.700
 there are air vents on the top as well 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 the whole noise out so the sound out 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.430
 so to speak otherwise the monitor is for 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.960
 me absolutely silent means absolutely silent 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.280
 in operation and that is for me too 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.409
 very important criterion in the thing 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.969
 I would beep or whistle it 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.630
 I would have a right back with me 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.460
 put back 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.590
 the back is another small lever 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.539
 or a hook for the cable guide pair 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.239
 safety instructions etc 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.159
 nothing complicated and come now 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.930
 two times the connections to the 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.040
 on the left is actually 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.530
 only I have her but too late 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 Seen the city 's electricity connection 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.650
 that means he has the power supply 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.879
 also internally that means one has here 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.349
 no flick rumfliegen but 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.340
 just cable it afterwards 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.890
 ready and co 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.349
 and on the right side we have 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.750
 left the dvi quasi the vga connection in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.030
 the middle the dvi d then the hdmi 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.799
 Speaker input and speaker 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.659
 exit is also a criterion for me 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.189
 that is, the harmonic fulfills everything 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.230
 You have to know if you are 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.579
 144 educator then wants so 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.060
 always wants to operate on the computer 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.530
 you need a dvi d cable that is 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.609
 a full occupancy otherwise that will 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.010
 do not work 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.510
 I do not know if that what then anyway 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.639
 I think that happens then 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.189
 only start up in normal operation 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.919
 So speak to 60 years otherwise 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.480
 Survey over 60 or 144 dpi 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.659
 we would not speak here now that would 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.919
 easily destroy the whole thing or here 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.019
 fill the frame 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.849
 I'm super with the monitor so far 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.120
 almost nothing is satisfactory 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.260
 negative say except that the tn panel 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.409
 Of course not exactly speaking for it 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.209
 especially super ride realistic picture 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.379
 somehow represent images that is 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.120
 for photo editing I would the 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.040
 not recommended for that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.540
 this tn panel for everything you need 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.970
 So fast represents games et cetera 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.290
 absolutely great here again in the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.459
 shortly connected to the fast without 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.530
 my cable jumbled behind 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.690
 to move properly as I said 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.840
 monitor in my eyes to gamble 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.959
 absolutely suitable and the difference 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.479
 between 60 hertz and 144 heart sees 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.739
 I personally see that many others 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.389
 see there are also various over 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.479
 settings videos about settings 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.220
 videos on youtube and me personally 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:56.040
 can only tell the difference between 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.959
 a 140 or 120 yards monitor and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.829
 a 60 heart monitor is clear 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.290
 visible 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.329
 the monitor otherwise still down here 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.799
 Fixed buttons that means no usd menu 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.689
 but just plain nonsense has 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.280
 no touch sensitive buttons but 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.659
 I find the right switch personally 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.250
 good as well 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.769
 However, they are for my taste 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 a bit weird 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.889
 I wished that you were on the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.150
 side are but so for me that is part 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.650
 exactly what I imagined ' 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.299
 better again take this opportunity to thank you on 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.740
 all of them share this very part 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.419
 probably have and of course to all 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.490
 I even have a monitor 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.229
 I have recommended to pack the link 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.669
 Amazon, of course, and pure if you 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.690
 want to give you the part 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.250
 maybe for christmas or later 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.180
 you can do that again via my link 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.590
 order gets a little 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.819
 Commission for all who do not 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.860
 interested who can this here 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.690
 ignore that is now for 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.729
 only a small hint 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.960
 I bought this part myself 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.520
 Lose one more time ask in 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.949
 my hardware video what I have there now 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.629
 just my monitor yes I have 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.949
 before that was not gone that is 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.120
 even here in the continued existence as 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.069
 so who does not sell 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.139
 and that compares to this 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.000
 monitor the colors even a little bit 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.060
 little bit I say crisper there is 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.340
 wrong because the asus monitor should 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.520
 but has extremely high contrast 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.560
 colors look a bit on the asus 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.759
 exaggerated from now you have to 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.870
 However, I do not say yet 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.580
 I have not calibrated it yet 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.979
 set me 100 percent and me 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.479
 assume that if I perfect him 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.509
 have set with all sorts 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.490
 test images that you can find on the net 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.259
 that I'm also a very good one 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.370
 excellent result out get 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.539
 I do not have it now 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.520
 taken care of because I just play 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.289
 I wanted and here I have almost only the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.199
 preset values ​​taken a bit 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.630
 adapted to my circumstances and that 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.860
 is exactly what I wanted so 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.419
 thank you for the recommendation 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.680
 my name is chimpanzee i say we 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.539
 Of course, you always see us next video 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.740
 go in and have a job for me 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.210
