hello<00:00:02.220> everyone<00:00:02.700> today<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.870> going<00:00:04.080> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hello everyone today we're going to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.309 
hello everyone today we're going to
learn<00:00:04.470> about<00:00:04.650> fuel<00:00:05.279> pumps<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.990> on<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
learn about fuel pumps and on the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.589 
learn about fuel pumps and on the
chevrolet<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> 2002<00:00:10.139> Chevrolet

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
chevrolet so this is a 2002 Chevrolet

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.839 
chevrolet so this is a 2002 Chevrolet
okay<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> fuel<00:00:13.889> pump<00:00:14.160> doesn't<00:00:14.490> work<00:00:14.639> on

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
okay so the fuel pump doesn't work on

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.640 
okay so the fuel pump doesn't work on
this<00:00:15.030> one

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
this one

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
this one
so<00:00:17.869> we're<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> change<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:21.390> do

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
so we're going to change it and to do

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.540 
so we're going to change it and to do
that<00:00:23.689> we<00:00:24.689> took<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.140> gas<00:00:25.350> tank<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> we

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that we took the gas tank out and we

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
that we took the gas tank out and we
took<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> old<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.300> there's<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.109> little

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
took the old one out there's that little

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
took the old one out there's that little
hole<00:00:28.439> there<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:31.790> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.210> took<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
hole there so this is what we took you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.540 
hole there so this is what we took you
out<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> little

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
out you can see it's got the little

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.510 
out you can see it's got the little
level<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.980> variable<00:00:40.980> resistor

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
level here with the variable resistor

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540 
level here with the variable resistor
right<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.510> shows<00:00:43.350> how<00:00:43.590> much<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.219> level

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
right here that shows how much the level

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
right here that shows how much the level
of<00:00:44.700> fuel<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:46.039> we've<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.280> another

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of fuel is in there we've got another

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720 
of fuel is in there we've got another
thing<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.870> black<00:00:49.200> part<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.160> pressure

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
thing this black part it's the pressure

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.630 
thing this black part it's the pressure
sensor<00:00:51.410> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> other<00:00:53.010> side<00:00:53.250> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
sensor if you look on the other side you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.689 
sensor if you look on the other side you
can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> goes<00:00:54.270> through<00:00:55.280> right<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.579> as

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
can see it goes through right there as

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.270 
can see it goes through right there as
it<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:57.320> tell<00:00:58.320> us<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> computer<00:00:59.039> how

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it goes through tell us the computer how

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.000 
it goes through tell us the computer how
much<00:00:59.430> pressures<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> gas<00:01:00.270> tank<00:01:01.010> another

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
much pressures in the gas tank another

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
much pressures in the gas tank another
thing<00:01:02.280> we've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.229> connector

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
thing we've got here is this connector

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
thing we've got here is this connector
this<00:01:05.670> connector<00:01:06.090> has<00:01:06.210> four<00:01:06.540> prongs<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this connector has four prongs so it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.899 
this connector has four prongs so it's
confusing<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> look<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> inside

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
confusing but if you look on the inside

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.810 
confusing but if you look on the inside
there's<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:13.010> let<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> fuel<00:01:16.350> pump

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
there's just to let go to the fuel pump

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
there's just to let go to the fuel pump
which<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.600> connector<00:01:19.220> yeah

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
which is right here this connector yeah

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390 
which is right here this connector yeah
this<00:01:20.430> connector<00:01:20.960> went<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.280> just<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this connector went in there just like

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
this connector went in there just like
that<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> first<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> check<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that so first you have to check take it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
that so first you have to check take it
out<00:01:27.570> check<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.040> voltage

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
out check to see if you have voltage

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
out check to see if you have voltage
while<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> engine<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.990> cranking<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.939> these

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
while the engine is cranking to these

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.289 
while the engine is cranking to these
two<00:01:33.270> wires<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> don't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
two wires and if you do and you don't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940 
two wires and if you do and you don't
have<00:01:36.420> any<00:01:36.600> fuel<00:01:36.869> pressure<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.500> we'll<00:01:37.799> talk

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
have any fuel pressure and we'll talk

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
have any fuel pressure and we'll talk
about<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> minute<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
about that in a minute then you know you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
about that in a minute then you know you
have<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> change<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.200> whole<00:01:40.380> thing<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
have to change this whole thing you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
have to change this whole thing you
can't<00:01:41.430> buy<00:01:41.610> parts<00:01:41.970> separate<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.659> buy

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
can't buy parts separate you have to buy

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.920 
can't buy parts separate you have to buy
this<00:01:42.810> whole<00:01:43.170> thing<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.750> $250<00:01:45.750> from

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this whole thing it's a $250 from

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.539 
this whole thing it's a $250 from
autozone<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.770> anyway<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
autozone so anyway now we're going to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.600 
autozone so anyway now we're going to
check<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:50.090> voltage<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:53.960> okay<00:01:55.610> we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
check for the voltage so do that okay we

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.749 
check for the voltage so do that okay we
get<00:01:56.790> our<00:01:57.229> plug<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:59.210> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.360> tell<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
get our plug here as you can tell this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
get our plug here as you can tell this
plug<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> plug<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.020> went<00:02:04.229> into<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
plug is the plug that went into that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
plug is the plug that went into that
white<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.390> plugged<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.600> like

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
white one there plugged in just like

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.790 
white one there plugged in just like
that<00:02:07.580> anyways<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.840> turns<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> tooth

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that anyways it turns out that the tooth

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
that anyways it turns out that the tooth
wires<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> outside<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> ones<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
wires on the outside are the ones you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.440 
wires on the outside are the ones you
have<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.930> check

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
have to check

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.580 
have to check
so<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> plug<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:16.380> backside<00:02:17.380> you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
so you see the plug and backside you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.199 
so you see the plug and backside you
stick<00:02:17.890> those<00:02:18.069> little<00:02:18.310> probes<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.790> there<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
stick those little probes in there I

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.839 
stick those little probes in there I
also<00:02:19.690> made<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.020> label<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:21.340> don't<00:02:21.489> have<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.730> do

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
also made a label you don't have to do

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.500 
also made a label you don't have to do
that<00:02:22.030> but<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> did<00:02:22.450> says<00:02:23.140> pump<00:02:23.440> ground<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.510> then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that but I did says pump ground and then

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.070 
that but I did says pump ground and then
this<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:26.790> says<00:02:28.050> 12<00:02:29.050> volt<00:02:29.470> positive<00:02:29.739> fuel<00:02:30.670> pump

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
this one says 12 volt positive fuel pump

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.059 
this one says 12 volt positive fuel pump
ok<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.830> now<00:02:32.980> we've<00:02:33.190> got<00:02:33.370> our<00:02:33.400> little

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
ok so now we've got our little

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.090 
ok so now we've got our little
multimeter<00:02:36.069> here<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.959> make<00:02:38.770> sure<00:02:38.920> you've<00:02:39.069> got

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
multimeter here and make sure you've got

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.960 
multimeter here and make sure you've got
the<00:02:39.370> plugs<00:02:40.920> make<00:02:41.920> sure<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.280> got<00:02:42.459> good<00:02:42.700> light

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the plugs make sure you got good light

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.970 
the plugs make sure you got good light
here<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.150> plugs<00:02:46.540> connected<00:02:47.489> like<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
here the plugs connected like that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.580 
here the plugs connected like that
ground<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.250> volts<00:02:51.760> anyway<00:02:52.510> next<00:02:53.080> we<00:02:53.350> go<00:02:53.500> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
ground and volts anyway next we go and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.120 
ground and volts anyway next we go and
put<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:56.830> 20<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:58.630> says<00:02:58.810> zero<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.100> can

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
put it on 20 and it says zero so we can

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.000 
put it on 20 and it says zero so we can
need<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:00.940> sure<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.200> shows<00:03:02.230> voltage

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
need to make sure that it shows voltage

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.580 
need to make sure that it shows voltage
while<00:03:03.459> cranking<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.150> let's<00:03:04.299> try<00:03:04.540> see<00:03:05.470> what

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
while cranking so let's try see what

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.210 
while cranking so let's try see what
happens<00:03:08.580> stick<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.730> key<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:09.910> there<00:03:11.400> ya<00:03:14.220> feel

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
happens stick the key in there ya feel

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.630 
happens stick the key in there ya feel
with<00:03:15.430> zero<00:03:17.370> yep

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
with zero yep

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.750 
with zero yep
we<00:03:19.329> have<00:03:19.480> voltage<00:03:20.070> about<00:03:21.070> 12<00:03:21.370> volts<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:24.549> we

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
we have voltage about 12 volts so we

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.030 
we have voltage about 12 volts so we
know<00:03:24.910> nothing<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.600> wrong<00:03:25.840> with<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.859> wiring

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
know nothing is wrong with the wiring

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.340 
know nothing is wrong with the wiring
and<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.489> second<00:03:30.850> question<00:03:31.299> was<00:03:31.420> does<00:03:32.290> it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
and now the second question was does it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.930 
and now the second question was does it
have<00:03:32.680> fuel<00:03:33.160> pressure<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:36.070> easy<00:03:36.400> all

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
have fuel pressure and that's easy all

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.990 
have fuel pressure and that's easy all
you<00:03:37.209> do<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.980> when<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.070> disconnect<00:03:39.280> those<00:03:39.790> two

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
you do is when you disconnect those two

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.920 
you do is when you disconnect those two
pipes<00:03:40.600> right<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.109> if<00:03:42.269> you<00:03:43.269> disconnect<00:03:43.630> it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
pipes right there if you disconnect it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.680 
pipes right there if you disconnect it
and<00:03:44.140> gas<00:03:45.070> kind<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.640> squirts<00:03:45.970> out<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
and gas kind of just squirts out that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.900 
and gas kind of just squirts out that
means<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.200> had<00:03:47.350> pressure<00:03:47.680> if<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.670> just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
means that it had pressure if it just

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.490 
means that it had pressure if it just
doesn't<00:03:49.299> do<00:03:49.359> anything<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.870> maybe<00:03:50.019> drips<00:03:50.350> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
doesn't do anything it maybe drips a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.770 
doesn't do anything it maybe drips a
little<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:51.609> means<00:03:51.820> there's<00:03:51.970> no<00:03:52.090> pressure<00:03:52.420> so

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
little that means there's no pressure so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.400 
little that means there's no pressure so
you<00:03:53.049> have<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.160> change<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.579> part<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:56.290> that's

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
you have to change that part so that's

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.470 
you have to change that part so that's
what<00:03:56.590> we're<00:03:56.680> going<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.829> do<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.549> we've<00:03:58.150> got<00:03:58.359> the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
what we're going to do so we've got the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.610 
what we're going to do so we've got the
new<00:03:58.630> one<00:03:58.810> right<00:03:59.410> here<00:03:59.680> already<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.410> looks

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
new one right here already and it looks

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.069 
new one right here already and it looks
just<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.160> old<00:04:03.190> one<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:03.780> let's<00:04:04.780> go<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
just like the old one so let's go and

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.460 
just like the old one so let's go and
put<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:07.209> has<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.390> little<00:04:07.630> locking<00:04:08.140> ring

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
put it in it has a little locking ring

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.910 
put it in it has a little locking ring
that<00:04:08.799> goes<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.190> there

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:28.440 

see<00:04:12.100> here<00:04:26.670> just<00:04:27.670> goes<00:04:27.850> right<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.390> little

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
see here just goes right in that little

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.650 
see here just goes right in that little
hole<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:30.760> earlier

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.020 

I'm<00:04:37.660> sure<00:04:37.930> you'll<00:04:38.290> see<00:04:38.650> really<00:04:39.070> good<00:04:42.030> yeah

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
I'm sure you'll see really good yeah

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.580 
I'm sure you'll see really good yeah
okay

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:57.170 

get<00:04:47.590> in<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.710> hole<00:04:47.980> right<00:04:49.290> move<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.500> away

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.540 

don't<00:04:58.180> rip<00:04:58.390> that<00:04:58.600> little<00:04:58.630> filter<00:04:59.340> hit<00:05:00.340> little

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
don't rip that little filter hit little

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:38.720 
don't rip that little filter hit little
filthy<00:05:00.910> little<00:05:01.090> there<00:05:01.510> go

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:51.820 

okay<00:05:40.770> now<00:05:45.240> this<00:05:46.240> uh

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.850 

should<00:05:52.830> do<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.130> there<00:05:53.600> so<00:05:54.600> next<00:05:55.440> we<00:05:55.650> have<00:05:55.740> to

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
should do it there so next we have to

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.300 
should do it there so next we have to
put<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.130> straps<00:05:56.430> on<00:05:56.670> and<00:05:57.950> I'll<00:05:58.950> show<00:05:59.010> you<00:05:59.220> that

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
put the straps on and I'll show you that

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
put the straps on and I'll show you that
in<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.640> next<00:05:59.700> video<00:06:00.000> okay<00:06:00.690> bye
