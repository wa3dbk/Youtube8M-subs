welcome to the equal ganic mm fish farm
systems<00:00:05.210> we're<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> be<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.690> through

systems we're going to be going through

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.740 
systems we're going to be going through
the<00:00:07.580> components<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> fish<00:00:08.910> farm<00:00:09.210> shortly

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the components of the fish farm shortly

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.110 
the components of the fish farm shortly
but<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.679> overlooking<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.759> see<00:00:11.940> the

clarifier<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> 50<00:00:20.160> no<00:00:20.279> distance<00:00:20.640> there

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
clarifier in the 50 no distance there

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660 
clarifier in the 50 no distance there
and<00:00:21.810> also<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> tank<00:00:23.189> production

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and also we can see the tank production

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.849 
and also we can see the tank production
system<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.359> well<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.710> through

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
system there as well so we going through

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.439 
system there as well so we going through
each<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.160> components<00:00:26.730> shortly<00:00:27.090> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
carry the add to the bottom of the tank

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.609 
carry the add to the bottom of the tank
and<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.939> waste<00:01:09.150> travel<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.020> central

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and the waste travel up this central

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
and the waste travel up this central
point<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> center<00:01:13.850> as<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.970> can

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
point and then in the center as we can

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200 
point and then in the center as we can
see<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> water<00:01:16.409> level<00:01:16.560> set<00:01:17.490> where

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
see here there's a water level set where

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
see here there's a water level set where
the<00:01:18.420> water<00:01:18.600> fog<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:18.990> remain<00:01:19.229> constant<00:01:19.530> right

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the water fog will remain constant right

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679 
the water fog will remain constant right
where<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.790> flying<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.540> all

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
where that what are we flying out so all

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
where that what are we flying out so all
the<00:01:21.840> wastes<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> bottom<00:01:23.040> will<00:01:23.220> flow

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the wastes that on the bottom will flow

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.820 
the wastes that on the bottom will flow
up<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.000> where<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.479> keep<00:01:24.830> after

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
up through that where they keep after

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
up through that where they keep after
that<00:01:26.040> vertical<00:01:26.520> chamber<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.720> out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that vertical chamber and then out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.219 
that vertical chamber and then out
through<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.320> play

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
through the play

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
through the play
once<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.890> water<00:01:30.040> flows<00:01:30.369> out<00:01:30.670> for<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
once the water flows out for that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.420 
once the water flows out for that
central<00:01:32.200> banks<00:01:32.500> is<00:01:32.650> going<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:32.920> move<00:01:33.130> for<00:01:33.369> this

above the water height and have a

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.100 
above the water height and have a
one-way<00:05:20.460> valve<00:05:20.700> on<00:05:21.180> there<00:05:21.330> as<00:05:21.450> well<00:05:21.660> also<00:05:21.870> to

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
one-way valve on there as well also to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.749 
one-way valve on there as well also to
protect

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
protect

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.390 
protect
since<00:05:23.999> that<00:05:24.210> might<00:05:24.389> be<00:05:24.569> in<00:05:24.659> this<00:05:25.400> also

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
since that might be in this also

if<00:05:30.839> the<00:05:31.080> erection<00:05:31.529> turns<00:05:31.770> off<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.159> will<00:05:32.279> also

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
if the erection turns off it will also

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.379 
if the erection turns off it will also
give<00:05:32.699> you<00:05:32.819> an<00:05:33.449> indication<00:05:34.129> over<00:05:35.129> here<00:05:35.389> another

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
give you an indication over here another

give you an indication over here another
side<00:05:36.749> just<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.259> know<00:05:37.379> how<00:05:37.469> to<00:05:37.529> fuse<00:05:37.889> if<00:05:37.979> we

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
side just you know how to fuse if we

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.719 
side just you know how to fuse if we
have<00:05:38.219> a<00:05:39.529> lesser<00:05:40.529> priority<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.099> our<00:05:41.249> oxygen

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
have a lesser priority is our oxygen

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.850 
have a lesser priority is our oxygen
part<00:05:41.999> obviously<00:05:42.839> they<00:05:43.139> did<00:05:43.289> it<00:05:43.379> cleaned<00:05:43.620> every

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
part obviously they did it cleaned every

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.519 
part obviously they did it cleaned every
once<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.189> a<00:05:44.279> while<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:45.539> all<00:05:45.659> we<00:05:45.779> need<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:45.960> do<00:05:46.199> is

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
once in a while so all we need to do is

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.890 
once in a while so all we need to do is
just<00:05:46.770> give<00:05:46.979> it<00:05:47.099> at<00:05:47.189> what<00:05:47.370> just<00:05:47.900> Kennedy

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
just give it at what just Kennedy

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.079 
just give it at what just Kennedy
Michael<00:05:49.229> for<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.439> let<00:05:50.219> that<00:05:50.339> time<00:05:50.580> go<00:05:50.729> back<00:05:50.909> in

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.089 
Michael for the let that time go back in

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.369 
Michael for the let that time go back in
the<00:05:51.360> system<00:05:51.539> that<00:05:51.809> will<00:05:51.900> just<00:05:52.080> sit<00:05:52.229> there

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
the system that will just sit there

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.369 
the system that will just sit there
nicely<00:05:52.669> monitoring<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.729> temperature<00:05:54.379> that's

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:55.379 
nicely monitoring the temperature that's

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:57.049 
nicely monitoring the temperature that's
pretty<00:05:55.620> well<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:55.889> for<00:05:56.129> our<00:05:56.219> system<00:05:56.639> then<00:05:56.999> we

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:57.059 
pretty well it for our system then we

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:58.700 
pretty well it for our system then we
put<00:05:57.240> our<00:05:57.270> fishing<00:05:57.689> for<00:05:58.050> salmon<00:05:58.289> our<00:05:58.529> fish

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
put our fishing for salmon our fish

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.279 
put our fishing for salmon our fish
feeder<00:05:58.949> flat
