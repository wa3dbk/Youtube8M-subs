 welcome to the videos of tlahuicole 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.130
 trailer of the human centipede 3 finally 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.890
 came out we see the first glimpse of the human 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.599
 centipede 3 the last installment of the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 controversial franchise will show a centipede 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.470
 human integrated by 500 people 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.630
 considered one of the franchises 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.450
 most controversial films of all 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.040
 the times the human centipede returns 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.410
 with the final part of this franchise 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.210
 for a chilling closure which 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.910
 apparently will have the presence 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.640
 of an integrated human centipede of 500 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.489
 people remember that in the first 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.699
 it was 3 in the second of 12 and now it 's 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.800
 of 500 between time in weekly presented a 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.449
 first look at the project and although not 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.370
 they show simple human in action that is 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.949
 what we want to see shows us 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.500
 doctor josep hater is theiler 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.659
 leaders of the first film walking 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.450
 through a room surrounded by 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.370
 prisoners who allegedly 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.470
 will integrate the strange creature the film 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.780
 is again directed by tom six 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.790
 director of the previous deliveries and 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 who revealed between time in weekly that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.970
 this third delivery will be totally 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.610
 different 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.070
 parts 1 and 2 and certainly not so 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.350
 grotesque but it will be the most controversial 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.330
 politically speaking you will have many 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.520
 teasing and it will be the darkest 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.400
 comic of the three the first ones have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.010
 a European touch the third is very 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.010
 American with bigger budget a great 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.490
 score and wide screen and a human centipede 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.920
 immensely great well what is the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.170
 synopsis I'll tell you a little about the owner of 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.020
 the bill voss prison that is the actor 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 tyler leader of the first movie has 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.850
 problems leading a big prison in 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 united states its correctional has 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.550
 statistically the largest number of 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.430
 riots as well as huge expenses in 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.970
 personal and medical bills throughout 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.100
 country but even worse does not think that receives 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 the respect it deserves on the part of the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.720
 resources and the state governor 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.820
 personified by the actor eric roberts 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 it also constantly fails with its 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.620
 ideas for getting penance 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 capital to put all the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.829
 internal 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720
 After receiving notice of dismissal 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.299
 of the governor his loyal right hand 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.480
 tweet that is personified by the actor 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.360
 Laurence Harvey will remember him for the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.400
 movie 'the always his hand 2 is the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.069
 fat with psychological problems that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.620
 create without human feet of 12 people 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.599
 this one came up with a wonderful idea a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.819
 revolutionary concept that will change the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.430
 penitentiary system and it will save you 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.709
 million dollars an idea based on 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.290
 the movies the human centipede that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.329
 will literally and figuratively 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.000
 all inmates on their knees to suffer 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.659
 a life sentence with nothing to lose 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.239
 bill and dui form a centipede of 500 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.220
 prisoners it is worth mentioning that the human 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.349
 centipede is a franchise that you have 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.260
 to worship there is no way for the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.200
 hate even if you think you belong to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.079
 exquisite of cinema is irreverent is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.750
 unpleasant and petty besides that it 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.299
 he does with a sincere everything of me it is worth 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 mothers what they think about all are 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.730
 fun is what it says tom six 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.600
 What strikes me is that this 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.170
 director 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.480
 tyler loves to Leezer and lawrence 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.240
 harvey that puts them back in his 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.120
 movie or will they be so good 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.820
 actors that put them back and there's no 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.330
 more actors who want to belong to 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:53.230
 this franchise that is the simple human 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.050
 because we remember that Tyler Leezer dies 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.870
 in the one he dies doing the role 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.760
 of the psychopathic surgeon who creates the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.530
 simple the first simple is human dies 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.460
 of a shot in the head by a detective 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.620
 and what is Lawrence Harvey that came out of 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.800
 with the character of martÃ­n he marked it in 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.360
 the second installment of human centipede 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.750
 dies when the head of the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.170
 simple human of 12 people esslingen 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.330
 and this law to be this lowers the 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.000
 pants and he puts a plastic cone 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.920
 in that cone you put what is a simple 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.520
 I live and he dies instantly poisoned 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.919
 internally 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.949
 So, you have to love these 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:40.539
 actors or no longer and nobody else wants 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.990
 being in your movie starts well will have
