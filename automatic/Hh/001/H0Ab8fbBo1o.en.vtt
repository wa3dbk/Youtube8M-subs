figure and I cannot wait until they I
assume<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:36.030> will<00:01:36.240> release<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.049> wax<00:01:37.290> figure

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
assume they will release a wax figure

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
assume they will release a wax figure
because<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> can't<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.430> boil<00:01:38.880> without<00:01:39.600> wax

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
because you can't have boil without wax

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
because you can't have boil without wax
or<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.770> does<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.250> sense<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.060> does
