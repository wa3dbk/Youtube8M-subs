apology or religious baking makes
basically<00:00:18.779> making<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.320> mesh<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> object

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
basically making the mesh of the object

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.150 
basically making the mesh of the object
look<00:00:20.970> clear<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.890> having<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
look clear and basically not having a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.560 
look clear and basically not having a
whole<00:00:23.250> bunch<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> verts<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:23.970> place<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
whole bunch of verts in one place and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.939 
whole bunch of verts in one place and
basically<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> whole<00:00:25.740> big

mess around this cube a little bit gotta
move<00:00:33.630> around<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.110> verts<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.880> no<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.390> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

right here the press down so it doesn't

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
right here the press down so it doesn't
start<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.610> can't<00:00:54.059> select<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> vertices

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
start so you can't select the vertices

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470 
start so you can't select the vertices
behind<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.850> anyways<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.329> and

see two apology on this is black is you

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.350 
see two apology on this is black is you
know<00:01:44.630> switch<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.709> firm<00:01:45.920> owed<00:01:46.179> show<00:01:47.179> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
know switch to the firm owed show the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.740 
know switch to the firm owed show the
vertices<00:01:48.049> on<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.789> you<00:01:49.789> can't<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.270> objects

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
vertices on it you can't have objects

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.620 
vertices on it you can't have objects
looking<00:01:51.020> like<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.350> not<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.039> just<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:52.369> good

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
looking like this not it's just not good

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.959 
looking like this not it's just not good
not<00:01:53.630> good<00:01:53.780> practice<00:01:54.459> so<00:01:55.459> what<00:01:55.609> we're<00:01:55.729> going<00:01:55.850> to

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
not good practice so what we're going to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.190 
not good practice so what we're going to
go<00:01:56.060> ahead<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.299> do<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.689> we're<00:01:56.959> going<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.109> go

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
go ahead and do is we're going to go

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.480 
go ahead and do is we're going to go
ahead<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.409> transform<00:01:57.859> much<00:01:58.009> these<00:01:58.219> verts

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
ahead and transform much these verts

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.100 
ahead and transform much these verts
back<00:01:58.819> into<00:02:00.310> acute<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:02.539> let's<00:02:02.689> go<00:02:02.780> ahead<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.989> do

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
back into acute so let's go ahead and do

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.190 
back into acute so let's go ahead and do
that<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:05.360> basically<00:02:05.630> we're<00:02:05.929> going<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.110> go

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
that so basically we're going to go

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.309 
that so basically we're going to go
ahead<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.380> look<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:06.799> is<00:02:07.039> how<00:02:07.219> can<00:02:07.759> we<00:02:08.319> remove

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
ahead and look at is how can we remove

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.940 
ahead and look at is how can we remove
these<00:02:09.799> edges<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:11.660> make<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.079> where<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.440> one

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
these edges to make it to where it's one

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.600 
these edges to make it to where it's one
plane<00:02:15.010> well<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.819> these<00:02:17.260> triangles<00:02:18.260> here<00:02:18.860> it's

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
plane well for these triangles here it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.390 
plane well for these triangles here it's
actually<00:02:19.940> quite<00:02:20.060> simple<00:02:20.829> we're<00:02:21.829> going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.129> go

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
actually quite simple we're going to go

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.069 
actually quite simple we're going to go
into<00:02:22.549> face<00:02:22.910> selection<00:02:23.390> mode<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.780> as<00:02:23.989> you

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
into face selection mode you can as you

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.440 
into face selection mode you can as you
can<00:02:24.200> tell<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:24.620> select<00:02:25.400> multiple<00:02:25.670> faces

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
can tell you can select multiple faces

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.129 
can tell you can select multiple faces
on<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.840> side<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> cube<00:02:27.410> here<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:32.840> what<00:02:33.019> we

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
on the side of the cube here now what we

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.949 
on the side of the cube here now what we
can<00:02:33.260> do<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:34.269> select<00:02:35.269> these<00:02:35.450> two<00:02:35.510> triangles

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
can do here select these two triangles

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.550 
can do here select these two triangles
right<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:39.319> press<00:02:39.560> f4<00:02:40.400> filling<00:02:41.440> now<00:02:42.440> this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
right here you press f4 filling now this

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.559 
right here you press f4 filling now this
actually<00:02:42.980> corrects<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.880> tries<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> make<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
actually corrects it and tries to make a

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.150 
actually corrects it and tries to make a
four-point<00:02:45.410> square<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:47.590> there<00:02:48.590> we<00:02:48.680> go<00:02:48.889> we

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
four-point square and there we go we

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.490 
four-point square and there we go we
succeeded<00:02:49.609> on<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.880> we<00:02:50.720> come<00:02:50.900> over<00:02:50.930> here<00:02:51.260> do

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
succeeded on that we come over here do

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.180 
succeeded on that we come over here do
the<00:02:51.590> same<00:02:51.799> thing<00:02:52.010> for<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:53.560> as<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.769> see<00:02:55.010> that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
the same thing for this as you see that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.879 
the same thing for this as you see that
the<00:02:55.370> mesh<00:02:55.609> is<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.690> pit<00:02:57.079> back<00:02:57.260> together<00:02:58.180> no

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
the mesh is now pit back together no

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:07.299 
the mesh is now pit back together no
vertices<00:03:00.889> no<00:03:02.709> cracks<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.880> all<00:03:05.030> looks<00:03:05.209> good
