critical thing there is we need to cut
out<00:00:55.090> for<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.450> hole<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:56.079> we<00:00:56.200> want<00:00:56.410> that<00:00:56.559> to

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
out for the hole and we want that to

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.190 
out for the hole and we want that to
land<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.219> edge<00:00:57.370> here<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:58.690> first<00:00:58.930> course

land on the edge here the first course
of<00:00:59.290> action<00:00:59.410> is<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.770> snap<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.100> chalk<00:01:00.250> line

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
of action is to snap a chalk line

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.549 
of action is to snap a chalk line
between<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.120> poles<00:01:01.329> in<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.540> garage<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:02.379> is

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
between the poles in the garage this is

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.109 
between the poles in the garage this is
necessary<00:01:02.950> because<00:01:03.340> this<00:01:03.700> will<00:01:03.879> be<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
necessary because this will be the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.459 
necessary because this will be the
straight<00:01:04.329> line<00:01:04.509> from<00:01:04.719> which<00:01:04.899> we<00:01:05.049> lay<00:01:05.199> out<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
straight line from which we lay out the

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.380 
straight line from which we lay out the
floor<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:06.430> assure<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.939> garage<00:01:07.180> is

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.950 
drill and what we have chucked up in
here<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.030> which<00:01:43.390> call<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:43.930> is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
here is this which call it which is

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.320 
here is this which call it which is
called<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.320> hole<00:01:44.500> saw<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.700> center<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.210> is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
called a hole saw the center of it is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.630 
called a hole saw the center of it is
basically<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.049> regular<00:01:47.380> drill<00:01:47.619> bit<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:48.009> then

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
basically a regular drill bit and then

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.300 
basically a regular drill bit and then
this<00:01:48.759> hockey-puck<00:01:49.180> looking<00:01:49.659> thing<00:01:49.869> has<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
this hockey-puck looking thing has the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.590 
this hockey-puck looking thing has the
serrated<00:01:51.670> teeth<00:01:51.939> they<00:01:52.210> go<00:01:52.329> all<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> way

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
serrated teeth they go all the way

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.300 
serrated teeth they go all the way
around<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:53.110> that's<00:01:53.439> our<00:01:53.619> center<00:01:53.890> mark<00:01:54.130> right

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
around it that's our center mark right

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.429 
around it that's our center mark right
there<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:55.119> I'm<00:01:55.180> gonna<00:01:55.299> line<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.720> up<00:01:55.780> on<00:01:56.140> that

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
there so I'm gonna line this up on that

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.039 
there so I'm gonna line this up on that
line<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> edge<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.000> hole<00:01:58.270> saw<00:01:58.570> up<00:01:58.810> with

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
line the edge of this hole saw up with

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.460 
line the edge of this hole saw up with
the<00:01:59.400> inside<00:02:00.400> edge<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.060> tile<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.409> looks

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
the inside edge of this tile that looks

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.339 
the inside edge of this tile that looks
pretty<00:02:02.829> good<00:02:03.040> pull<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.640> trigger

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.690 

at<00:02:11.349> first<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:11.829> a<00:02:11.890> pile<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.370> looks<00:02:12.519> like<00:02:12.579> a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
at first it's a pile it looks like a

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.129 
at first it's a pile it looks like a
pretty<00:02:12.939> good<00:02:13.120> circle<00:02:13.569> does<00:02:13.689> that<00:02:13.870> that's

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:14.139 
pretty good circle does that that's

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.089 
pretty good circle does that that's
let's<00:02:14.739> go<00:02:14.859> see<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.129> fits<00:02:15.310> good<00:02:16.889> see<00:02:17.889> how<00:02:18.040> we

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
let's go see if it fits good see how we

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.470 
let's go see if it fits good see how we
did<00:02:20.099> nothing<00:02:21.480> uh-huh<00:02:22.499> right<00:02:23.499> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.739> money

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
did nothing uh-huh right on the money

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.149 
did nothing uh-huh right on the money
okay<00:02:25.480> let's<00:02:25.780> start<00:02:26.019> putting<00:02:26.200> down<00:02:26.439> some<00:02:26.620> tiles

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
okay let's start putting down some tiles

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.789 
okay let's start putting down some tiles
okay<00:02:27.579> checkerboard<00:02:28.329> right<00:02:28.750> yeah<00:02:29.379> like<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> big

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
okay checkerboard right yeah like a big

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.470 
okay checkerboard right yeah like a big
puzzle<00:02:30.010> okay<00:02:30.579> let's<00:02:30.790> alternate<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.450> I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
puzzle okay let's alternate when I

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
puzzle okay let's alternate when I
handed<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:32.079> beige<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.430> i'll<00:02:33.489> show<00:02:33.639> you<00:02:33.700> how

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
handed a beige one and i'll show you how

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.390 
handed a beige one and i'll show you how
this<00:02:33.939> is<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.209> go<00:02:34.329> in<00:02:34.919> the<00:02:35.919> pieces<00:02:36.310> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
this is gonna go in the pieces of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.949 
this is gonna go in the pieces of
flooring<00:02:36.700> interlocks<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.780> pieces

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
flooring interlocks just like the pieces

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.989 
flooring interlocks just like the pieces
of<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.230> puzzle<00:02:38.409> we<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.099> rubber<00:02:39.430> mallet<00:02:39.700> to

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
of a puzzle we use a rubber mallet to

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.030 
of a puzzle we use a rubber mallet to
hammer<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.480> pieces<00:02:40.810> into<00:02:40.959> place<00:02:41.079> we<00:02:41.829> build

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
hammer the pieces into place we build

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.740 
hammer the pieces into place we build
along<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.489> chalk<00:02:42.760> line<00:02:43.030> between<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.540> poles

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
along the chalk line between the poles

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.569 
along the chalk line between the poles
to<00:02:43.959> create<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.379> straight<00:02:44.709> line<00:02:45.010> base<00:02:45.280> for<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
to create the straight line base for the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.659 
to create the straight line base for the
floor<00:02:49.379> we<00:02:50.379> mark<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> second<00:02:51.069> tile<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.459> same

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
floor we mark the second tile the same

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.429 
floor we mark the second tile the same
way<00:02:51.849> as<00:02:51.969> the<00:02:52.120> first<00:02:52.419> and<00:02:52.750> then<00:02:52.870> cut<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.260> hole

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
way as the first and then cut the hole

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.390 
way as the first and then cut the hole
for<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.769> pole<00:02:55.199> once<00:02:56.199> this<00:02:56.469> is<00:02:56.650> done<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.099> rest

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
for the pole once this is done the rest

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.709 
for the pole once this is done the rest
of<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.609> floor<00:02:57.790> fits<00:02:58.060> together<00:02:58.209> without<00:02:58.569> any

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
of the floor fits together without any

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.129 
of the floor fits together without any
other<00:02:59.139> worries<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:01.000> process<00:03:01.419> is<00:03:01.569> repetitive

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
other worries the process is repetitive

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:08.380 
other worries the process is repetitive
but<00:03:02.409> goes<00:03:02.560> pretty<00:03:02.799> quickly

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.000 

the<00:03:09.390> last<00:03:09.690> finishing<00:03:10.080> touch<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.770> floor

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the last finishing touch for this floor

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
the last finishing touch for this floor
is<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.370> edging<00:03:11.790> that's<00:03:12.180> gonna<00:03:12.390> go<00:03:12.569> all<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
is this edging that's gonna go all the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.150 
is this edging that's gonna go all the
way<00:03:12.959> around<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.470> give<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.709> really<00:03:13.920> smooth

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
way around and give you a really smooth

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010 
way around and give you a really smooth
transition<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> floor<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.569> gonna<00:03:15.720> slide

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
transition to the floor it's gonna slide

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.980 
transition to the floor it's gonna slide
on<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.350> edge<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.390> this<00:03:18.390> we<00:03:18.660> may<00:03:18.780> have

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
on the edge here like this we may have

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.920 
on the edge here like this we may have
to<00:03:19.200> finesse<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.100> bit<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.660> cap<00:03:21.660> off

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
to finesse it a little bit and cap off

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.260 
to finesse it a little bit and cap off
all<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.410> these<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.220> inter<00:03:23.670> locking<00:03:23.819> tabs

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
all of these you know inter locking tabs

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.330 
all of these you know inter locking tabs
here<00:03:24.570> look<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.260> nice<00:03:25.410> what<00:03:26.130> we're<00:03:26.250> gonna

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
here look really nice what we're gonna

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.610 
here look really nice what we're gonna
do<00:03:26.550> when<00:03:26.790> our<00:03:26.910> flooring<00:03:27.450> makes<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.260> corner

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
do when our flooring makes a corner

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.650 
do when our flooring makes a corner
turns<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.310> corner<00:03:29.459> we're<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.880> cut<00:03:30.120> up<00:03:30.209> my

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
turns a corner we're gonna cut up my

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.330 
turns a corner we're gonna cut up my
turn<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.440> edge<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.770> trim<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.220> have

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
turn on the edge of this trim so we have

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.840 
turn on the edge of this trim so we have
a<00:03:32.370> nice<00:03:32.610> clean<00:03:33.090> finished<00:03:33.959> corner<00:03:34.700> we<00:03:35.700> use<00:03:35.820> a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
a nice clean finished corner we use a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.300 
a nice clean finished corner we use a
t-square<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.600> mark<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.840> 45-degree<00:03:37.620> angle<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:38.040> to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
t-square to mark a 45-degree angle on to

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.559 
t-square to mark a 45-degree angle on to
the<00:03:38.430> edging<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.090> cut<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
the edging and then cut it with a
