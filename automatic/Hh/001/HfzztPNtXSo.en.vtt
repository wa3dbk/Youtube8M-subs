kind of like tentacles I think in the
the<00:03:37.680> series<00:03:37.890> uses<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.640> grab<00:03:38.880> or<00:03:39.210> stun<00:03:40.050> is<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
the series uses the grab or stun is the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.970 
the series uses the grab or stun is the
mutants<00:03:43.950> he's<00:03:44.130> trying<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> capture<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.980> terms

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
mutants he's trying to capture and terms

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.030 
mutants he's trying to capture and terms
of<00:03:47.160> his<00:03:47.280> waist<00:03:47.550> here<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.220> there's<00:03:53.550> a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
of his waist here and see there's a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.010 
of his waist here and see there's a
supplicant<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.490> this<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:58.430> articulation<00:03:59.430> there

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
supplicant is this a articulation there

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:09.190 
supplicant is this a articulation there
at<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.170> waist<00:04:03.470> looks<00:04:04.470> like<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.740> can<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:04.980> 360

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.390 

again<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.710> at<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:10.860> detail<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
again just look at that detail in the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.550 
again just look at that detail in the
back<00:04:11.580> there<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:16.530> some<00:04:16.770> of<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.980> this

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
back there and this some of this this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.720 
back there and this some of this this
molding<00:04:19.560> there<00:04:19.739> as<00:04:19.830> well<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.280> very<00:04:20.489> very

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
molding there as well it's very very

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.580 
molding there as well it's very very
nice<00:04:20.880> alright<00:04:21.810> continue<00:04:22.290> on<00:04:22.410> with

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
nice alright continue on with

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.670 
nice alright continue on with
articulation<00:04:24.980> looks<00:04:25.980> like<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
articulation looks like you can do a

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.680 
articulation looks like you can do a
little<00:04:28.770> bit<00:04:28.980> of<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.620> then<00:04:32.690> nothing

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
little bit of that and then nothing

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.510 
little bit of that and then nothing
nothing<00:04:33.900> really<00:04:34.260> too<00:04:34.890> much<00:04:34.920> back<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.310> forth

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
nothing really too much back and forth

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.910 
nothing really too much back and forth
like<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.800> kind<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.830> do<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.010> splits<00:04:39.920> hit

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
like that just kind of do the splits hit

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.070 
like that just kind of do the splits hit
terms<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.550> his<00:04:42.920> black<00:04:43.920> site<00:04:44.810> sorry<00:04:45.810> about<00:04:45.960> that

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
terms of his black site sorry about that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.300 
terms of his black site sorry about that
and<00:04:46.800> I'm<00:04:46.890> rotating<00:04:47.220> around<00:04:48.890> terms<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:50.130> his

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
and I'm rotating around terms of his

00:04:50.310 --> 00:05:00.650 
and I'm rotating around terms of his
knee<00:04:50.790> articulation<00:04:53.270> not<00:04:54.270> bad<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:56.370> see

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.430 

and<00:05:01.660> then<00:05:02.410> as<00:05:02.500> far<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.950> his<00:05:03.430> ankle<00:05:04.200> just<00:05:05.200> just

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
and then as far as his ankle just just

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.990 
and then as far as his ankle just just
very<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.920> this<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.280> move<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.580> but<00:05:06.700> enough<00:05:06.880> to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
very is this the move it but enough to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520 
very is this the move it but enough to
say<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.210> there's<00:05:07.840> an<00:05:07.930> angle<00:05:08.170> there<00:05:08.350> so

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
say that there's an angle there so

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.740 
say that there's an angle there so
that's<00:05:08.650> pretty<00:05:08.890> cool<00:05:09.330> let's<00:05:10.330> take<00:05:10.480> a<00:05:10.510> look<00:05:10.660> at

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
that's pretty cool let's take a look at

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.530 
that's pretty cool let's take a look at
the<00:05:10.810> bottom<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.110> feet<00:05:11.410> look<00:05:11.680> at<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:12.540> nice

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
the bottom of feet look at that nice

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.840 
the bottom of feet look at that nice
nice<00:05:13.900> detailing<00:05:14.400> if<00:05:15.400> you're<00:05:15.580> going<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.760> get

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
one build a figure get this guy you can

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.740 
one build a figure get this guy you can
go<00:05:23.980> on<00:05:24.100> ebay<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.430> just<00:05:24.730> get<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:24.910> figure

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
go on ebay and just get the figure

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.720 
go on ebay and just get the figure
itself<00:05:25.840> i<00:05:26.050> think<00:05:26.080> i<00:05:26.230> think<00:05:26.470> i<00:05:26.740> got<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.580> on

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
itself i think i think i got this on

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.120 
itself i think i think i got this on
auction<00:05:28.150> for<00:05:28.330> like<00:05:28.570> fifty<00:05:28.840> bucks<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.890> i<00:05:29.980> think

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
auction for like fifty bucks and i think

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.620 
auction for like fifty bucks and i think
that's<00:05:30.280> what<00:05:30.400> I've<00:05:30.490> seen<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.820> option<00:05:31.120> go<00:05:31.240> for

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
that's what I've seen the option go for

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.380 
that's what I've seen the option go for
an<00:05:31.840> average<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:33.370> that's<00:05:33.940> what<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.210> probably

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
an average so that's what you probably

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.650 
an average so that's what you probably
should<00:05:34.630> expect<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.110> pay<00:05:35.260> for<00:05:35.290> this<00:05:35.710> guy<00:05:39.090> he<00:05:40.090> can

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
should expect to pay for this guy he can

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.300 
should expect to pay for this guy he can
be<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.810> little<00:05:40.930> hard<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.470> stand<00:05:41.620> sometimes<00:05:42.010> but

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
be a little hard to stand sometimes but

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.650 
be a little hard to stand sometimes but
you<00:05:42.700> know<00:05:43.290> he<00:05:44.290> can't<00:05:44.530> stand<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:44.920> his<00:05:45.040> own<00:05:45.190> so

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
you know he can't stand on his own so

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.240 
you know he can't stand on his own so
just<00:05:46.660> takes<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:46.870> little<00:05:46.990> bit<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.200> doing<00:05:48.160> now

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
just takes a little bit of doing now

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.630 
just takes a little bit of doing now
that<00:05:48.280> he<00:05:48.490> has<00:05:48.550> also<00:05:49.410> you<00:05:50.410> can<00:05:50.560> see<00:05:50.770> here<00:05:53.640> almost

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
that he has also you can see here almost

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.820 
that he has also you can see here almost
like<00:05:54.940> this<00:05:55.720> is<00:05:55.870> a<00:05:55.900> shoulder<00:05:56.320> armor<00:05:56.590> this<00:05:56.710> is
