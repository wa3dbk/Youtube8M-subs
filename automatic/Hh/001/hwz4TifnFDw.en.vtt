00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.210 
done every single Mouse review that I've
done<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:15.089> been<00:00:15.360> comparing<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.890> Razer

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
another I've never really done a view on

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
another I've never really done a view on
the<00:00:21.720> death<00:00:21.930> letter<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.830> been<00:00:23.010> out

are very familiar with it but I'll tell
you<00:00:44.579> why<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you why what is so different about the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.959 
you why what is so different about the
Black<00:00:46.770> Edition<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> normal<00:00:48.300> edition<00:00:48.629> so

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
Black Edition to the normal edition so

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.639 
Black Edition to the normal edition so
the<00:00:50.969> Black<00:00:51.149> Edition<00:00:51.300> mainly<00:00:51.870> obviously<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the Black Edition mainly obviously it's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
the Black Edition mainly obviously it's
is<00:00:53.010> basically<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.670> modded<00:00:54.059> Death<00:00:54.239> Adder

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is basically a modded Death Adder

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.770 
is basically a modded Death Adder
they<00:00:55.110> did<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.280> main<00:00:56.460> difference<00:00:56.850> being<00:00:57.059> well

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
they did the main difference being well

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
they did the main difference being well
other<00:00:58.260> than<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> internal<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.579> basically<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
other than the internal is basically the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.400 
other than the internal is basically the
same<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.750> three<00:01:00.870> thousand<00:01:01.170> five<00:01:01.289> hundred

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
same as the three thousand five hundred

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
same as the three thousand five hundred
dpi<00:01:02.219> Death<00:01:02.489> Adder

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
dpi Death Adder

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
dpi Death Adder
this<00:01:03.719> firmware<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.260> always<00:01:04.470> saying<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.070> only

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this firmware is always saying the only

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
this firmware is always saying the only
thing<00:01:05.369> different<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.850> probably<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.500> mouse

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thing different is probably the mouse

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
thing different is probably the mouse
wheel<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.610> incorporate<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
wheel which they incorporate a a the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.929 
wheel which they incorporate a a the
same<00:01:10.530> Mouse<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.100> form<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:13.820> like<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
same Mouse we I think form as like the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
same Mouse we I think form as like the
Mamba<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.810> Imperator<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> same

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
Mamba the Imperator that it's the same

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
Mamba the Imperator that it's the same
mouse<00:01:17.250> movement<00:01:17.640> except<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> fact<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
mouse movement except for the fact that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
mouse movement except for the fact that
it<00:01:18.600> doesn't<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.200> light<00:01:19.530> money<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it doesn't have like a light money and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.390 
it doesn't have like a light money and
also<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> different<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
also it this one is different from the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.789 
also it this one is different from the
original<00:01:23.549> adder<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.240> doesn't<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:25.080> LED

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
original adder it doesn't have a LED

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
original adder it doesn't have a LED
light<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.340> well<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.330> basically<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.990> look

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
light here as well so basically the look

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.490 
light here as well so basically the look
of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> smells<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.979> looks<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:30.090> very<00:01:30.500> carbon

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
of the smells it looks very very carbon

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
of the smells it looks very very carbon
it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.490> carbon<00:01:32.880> feel<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> I'll

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's a very very carbon feel and I'll

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's a very very carbon feel and I'll
try<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> describe<00:01:34.520> obviously<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> field<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
try to describe obviously the field that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
try to describe obviously the field that
shape<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.689> exactly<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> same<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
shape is exactly the same as the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.310 
shape is exactly the same as the
original<00:01:37.950> jet<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> surface<00:01:39.960> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
original jet that but the surface on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679 
original jet that but the surface on
this<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> first<00:01:41.939> saw<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.450> didn't

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
this like when I first saw it I didn't

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.240 
this like when I first saw it I didn't
know<00:01:42.780> how<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.079> actually<00:01:43.470> feel<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.829> thought<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
know how good actually feel I thought it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.670 
know how good actually feel I thought it
feel<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:44.970> more<00:01:45.240> matte<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
feel a little bit more matte a and a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.300 
feel a little bit more matte a and a
little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:48.470> bumpy<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> really

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
little bit more bumpy I like the really

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.190 
little bit more bumpy I like the really
grainy<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.909> thought<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.780> grainy

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
grainy I thought be really like grainy

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
grainy I thought be really like grainy
feeling<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.280> contrast<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
feeling but in contrast is actually a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.170 
feeling but in contrast is actually a
smooth<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.520> smooth<00:01:56.939> surface

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
smooth it's the very very smooth surface

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
smooth it's the very very smooth surface
it's<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:58.259> smoother<00:01:58.890> than<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> expected

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's much smoother than what I expected

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
it's much smoother than what I expected
like<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.790> original<00:02:03.360> Death<00:02:03.540> Adder<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.869> was

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
like and the original Death Adder it was

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
like and the original Death Adder it was
more<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.610> matte<00:02:05.610> team's<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> sticky

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
more like a matte team's like a sticky

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.440 
more like a matte team's like a sticky
surface<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.700> completely<00:02:08.700> smooth

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
surface this is just a completely smooth

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.690 
surface this is just a completely smooth
surface

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
surface

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.960 
surface
in<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.819> sense<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.440> bit<00:02:12.650> more

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
in a sense it is a little bit more

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.260 
in a sense it is a little bit more
comfortable

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
comfortable

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.380

I<00:02:14.300> probably<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.190> asked<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I probably if you asked if you if you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.699 
I probably if you asked if you if you
ask<00:02:17.510> me<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.720> probably<00:02:17.930> prefer<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.500> this

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
ask me I probably prefer like this

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.850 
ask me I probably prefer like this
surface<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.629> pattern<00:02:20.840> more<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.440> than<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
surface of that pattern more so than the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.740 
surface of that pattern more so than the
region<00:02:22.489> was<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.700> better<00:02:22.849> but<00:02:23.330> maybe<00:02:23.450> like

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
region was that better but maybe like

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.430 
region was that better but maybe like
when<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.050> sweat<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.680> may<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:26.390> be<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> sweat

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
when you sweat it may not be a sweat

the sides here it's they changed it so
basically<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:44.090> their<00:02:44.269> original<00:02:44.420> death<00:02:44.840> matter

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049

if you see the bottom of this mouse it's

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.069 
if you see the bottom of this mouse it's
the<00:02:47.599> same<00:02:47.900> old<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.410> really<00:02:49.069> glossy<00:02:50.079> like

kind of glossy surface like the sides

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.120

usually use this kind of surface but the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.479 
usually use this kind of surface but the

kind of smooth surface it's it's kind of

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.559 
kind of smooth surface it's it's kind of
smooth<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.299> well<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:11.989> very<00:03:12.530> um<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:14.209> too

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
smooth as well but it's very um it's too

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.900 
smooth as well but it's very um it's too
slick<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.620> actually<00:03:15.889> too<00:03:16.100> slick<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.760> you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
slick it's actually too slick like you

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.990 
slick it's actually too slick like you
you<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.959> not<00:03:18.139> able<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.530> grip<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.010> with<00:03:19.130> and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you you're not able to grip it with and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.930 
you you're not able to grip it with and
it<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.359> little<00:03:20.840> bit<00:03:21.760> sorry<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> little

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
it is a little bit sorry it's a little

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.990 
it is a little bit sorry it's a little
bit<00:03:23.799> like<00:03:24.799> slice<00:03:25.190> from<00:03:25.430> your<00:03:25.579> hand<00:03:25.760> can't

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
bit like slice from your hand can't

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.490 
bit like slice from your hand can't
really<00:03:26.180> grip<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.569> like<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.380> it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
really grip it like you like it and it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.870 
really grip it like you like it and it
just<00:03:27.650> kind<00:03:27.889> of<00:03:27.920> slides<00:03:28.190> off<00:03:28.489> your<00:03:28.670> hand

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
just kind of slides off your hand

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.849 
just kind of slides off your hand
obviously<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.600> grab<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> tighter<00:03:30.139> it<00:03:30.590> won't

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
obviously if I grab a tighter it won't

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.160 
obviously if I grab a tighter it won't
slide<00:03:31.130> off<00:03:31.190> right<00:03:31.549> but<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:32.389> just<00:03:32.600> if<00:03:33.049> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
slide off right but it just just if I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.870 
slide off right but it just just if I
sweat<00:03:33.500> me<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:33.859> like<00:03:33.980> orbit<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.519> just<00:03:34.670> slide

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
sweat me just like orbit and just slide

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.009 
sweat me just like orbit and just slide
off<00:03:35.000> my<00:03:35.030> hands<00:03:35.329> so<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:35.630> probably<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> only

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
off my hands so that's probably the only

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.190 
off my hands so that's probably the only
bad<00:03:36.500> thing<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.639> don't<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.299> about<00:03:38.329> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
bad thing that I don't like about a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.680 
bad thing that I don't like about a
Black<00:03:39.560> Edition<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.250> race<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.670> effect<00:03:40.940> but

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
Black Edition the race of effect but

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.569 
Black Edition the race of effect but
other<00:03:41.900> than<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.109> um<00:03:42.590> absolutely<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.280> mod

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
other than that um absolutely this mod

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.840 
other than that um absolutely this mod
is<00:03:43.880> looks<00:03:44.720> very<00:03:45.350> very<00:03:45.590> slick<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.220> top<00:03:46.609> surface

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
is looks very very slick the top surface

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.360 
is looks very very slick the top surface
I<00:03:47.239> really<00:03:47.750> really<00:03:47.959> like<00:03:48.079> only<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.950> fact<00:03:49.190> that

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
I really really like only the fact that

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.180 
I really really like only the fact that
the<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:50.269> part<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.870> surface<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.709> don't

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
the this part of the surface I don't

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.180 
the this part of the surface I don't
really<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.690> that's<00:03:54.230> really<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:55.010> mean

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
really like so that's really it I mean

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.789 
really like so that's really it I mean
whoa<00:03:55.730> also<00:03:56.090> one<00:03:56.299> more<00:03:56.389> thing<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
whoa also one more thing is that the

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.250 
whoa also one more thing is that the
mouse<00:03:57.980> skates<00:03:58.310> they<00:03:59.030> incorporate<00:03:59.599> a<00:03:59.690> mouse

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
mouse skates they incorporate a mouse

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.170 
mouse skates they incorporate a mouse
case<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.739> kind<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.790> little<00:04:01.910> bit

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
case that kind of is a little bit

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.699 
case that kind of is a little bit
different<00:04:02.450> than<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:02.690> original<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.290> can<00:04:03.380> see

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
different than the original you can see

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.360 
different than the original you can see
there<00:04:03.889> they<00:04:04.430> pops<00:04:05.060> out<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.810> slightly<00:04:06.440> I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.900 

think<00:04:10.370> it's<00:04:10.489> slightly<00:04:10.930> crooked<00:04:12.639> in<00:04:13.639> the<00:04:13.700> sense

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
think it's slightly crooked in the sense

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.789 
think it's slightly crooked in the sense
that<00:04:13.970> it's<00:04:14.329> looks<00:04:14.450> very<00:04:15.109> very<00:04:15.410> slightly

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
that it's looks very very slightly

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.099 
that it's looks very very slightly
crooked<00:04:16.099> I<00:04:16.820> don't<00:04:17.479> know<00:04:17.539> how<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> describe<00:04:17.959> it

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
crooked I don't know how to describe it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.890 
crooked I don't know how to describe it
but<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.530> does<00:04:18.739> make<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.130> mouse<00:04:19.599> feel<00:04:20.599> very

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
but it does make the mouse feel very

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.770 
but it does make the mouse feel very
very<00:04:21.109> smoothly<00:04:21.500> quite<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.159> glides<00:04:22.780> extremely

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
very smoothly quite it glides extremely

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.250
