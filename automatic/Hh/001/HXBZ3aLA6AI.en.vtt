00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.730

then for each side I'm going to twist my

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.240 
then for each side I'm going to twist my
hair<00:00:27.040> until<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.550> creates<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.240> bun<00:00:28.770> this<00:00:29.770> method

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
hair until it creates a bun this method

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.159 
hair until it creates a bun this method
allows<00:00:30.400> you<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.790> stretch<00:00:31.330> your<00:00:31.510> hair<00:00:31.779> over

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
allows you to stretch your hair over

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:52.920 
allows you to stretch your hair over
time<00:00:50.400> then<00:00:51.400> I'll<00:00:51.820> wrap<00:00:52.180> my<00:00:52.390> hair<00:00:52.629> with<00:00:52.780> the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
time then I'll wrap my hair with the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.259 
time then I'll wrap my hair with the
scarf<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.590> I'll<00:00:53.860> let<00:00:54.070> that<00:00:54.250> sit<00:00:54.550> for<00:00:54.580> probably

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
scarf and I'll let that sit for probably

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.950 
scarf and I'll let that sit for probably
30<00:00:55.600> minutes<00:00:56.729> now<00:00:57.729> it's<00:00:58.059> time<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.449> take<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.780> two

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960

and<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.810> love<00:01:04.050> this<00:01:04.290> bunny<00:01:04.620> method

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and I really love this bunny method

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.680 
and I really love this bunny method

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
because I can stretch my hair without

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
because I can stretch my hair without
using<00:01:07.230> any<00:01:07.560> type<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> heat

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
pin up the rest now I'm going to take a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.920 
pin up the rest now I'm going to take a
smaller<00:01:20.440> section<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:21.100> my<00:01:21.280> hair<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.930> carefully

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.100 

and<00:01:33.550> as<00:01:33.790> you're<00:01:34.060> grabbing<00:01:34.480> more<00:01:34.660> smaller

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
and as you're grabbing more smaller

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.950 
and as you're grabbing more smaller
sections<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.920> your<00:01:35.950> hair<00:01:36.100> be<00:01:37.000> sure<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.570> follow

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
sections of your hair be sure to follow

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.840 
sections of your hair be sure to follow
the<00:01:38.140> pattern<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.770> your<00:01:38.890> twist<00:01:39.250> out<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:39.700> that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
the pattern of your twist out so that

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.790 
the pattern of your twist out so that
you<00:01:39.970> won't<00:01:40.120> run<00:01:40.270> into<00:01:40.510> any<00:01:40.660> tangles<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.740> knots

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
you won't run into any tangles or knots

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.930 
you won't run into any tangles or knots
that<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.430> may<00:01:42.700> create

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.610 

once<00:01:49.940> I'm<00:01:50.150> finished<00:01:50.570> with<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.900> section<00:01:51.380> I'm

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
once I'm finished with that section I'm

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.040 
once I'm finished with that section I'm
going<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.950> split<00:01:52.280> my<00:01:52.490> hair<00:01:52.760> in<00:01:52.850> half<00:01:53.060> then<00:01:53.810> take

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
going to split my hair in half then take

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.930 
going to split my hair in half then take
my<00:01:54.200> wide<00:01:54.410> tooth<00:01:54.440> comb<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.250> then<00:01:55.430> comb<00:01:55.760> out<00:01:55.910> my

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
my wide tooth comb and then comb out my

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.000 
my wide tooth comb and then comb out my
hair<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.960> helps<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.410> get<00:01:57.590> rid<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
hair and this helps to get rid of the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.220 
hair and this helps to get rid of the
curl<00:01:58.280> pattern<00:01:58.730> and<00:01:58.970> helps<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> achieve<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
curl pattern and helps to achieve that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.730 
curl pattern and helps to achieve that
big<00:02:00.470> fro<00:02:00.860> look

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.229 

then<00:02:04.610> I'll<00:02:04.790> finally<00:02:05.390> twist<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:06.110> section

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
then I'll finally twist up that section

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.290 
then I'll finally twist up that section
Bobby<00:02:08.959> pinging<00:02:09.319> away<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.069> then<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> repeat<00:02:10.940> for

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
Bobby pinging away and then I repeat for

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
Bobby pinging away and then I repeat for
the<00:02:11.390> next<00:02:11.690> session

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.870 

again<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.770> finger<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.280> table<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:16.790> hair

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.390 

then<00:02:20.660> use<00:02:20.900> your<00:02:21.110> wide<00:02:21.290> tooth<00:02:21.590> comb<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.950> comb

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
then use your wide tooth comb to comb

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.570 
then use your wide tooth comb to comb
out<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.610> curl<00:02:22.940> pattern<00:02:24.340> twist<00:02:25.340> up<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580

section

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.030 

and<00:02:29.519> then<00:02:30.000> pin<00:02:30.360> away

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.620 

now<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.310> I've<00:02:36.459> completed<00:02:36.940> all<00:02:37.240> four
