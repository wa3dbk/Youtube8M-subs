00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.410

 let's open and see what's here 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.030
 now wait a second 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.780

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:16.040

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:32.729
 push all packed in a box box 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.320
 I understood the poems I want to say hesitated so 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.320
 look good 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.710
 I hope to be like all integers 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 inside here we see such a visor here 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.840
 we can see how there is an application 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.100
 dark her yellow 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 let's see what's inside 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:16.000
 inside sleep video is all packed 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:21.580
 the package opens got we see 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.110
 inside there is such a daddy no well 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.570
 let's say such a pretty big one for 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.570
 wiping apparently glass here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.430
 instruction in English then all 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.380
 ok you can bring all 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.070
 excellent here too 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.030
 instruction speaks and say yes there is 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:53.739
 dimensions dimensions make sense here 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.340
 look here it dresses on the very 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:03.640
 a visor that already exists here 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:08.769
 look here is dark and yellow dark 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.920
 by the way in my less a little bit 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:17.190
 let's see there is a project here 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.030
 ticker so dark 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.910
 11 centimeters yellow 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 11 no groups are the same size i 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.350
 I understand that they can even be changed 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.890
 in some places to look at mine is it all 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.549
 removed although it may not be removed not 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.610
 knowing because you see all this in the film 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.250
 there is glass 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.540
 films on both sides and front and back 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:53.260
 I think they can be interchanged and not lying 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:58.630
 should be removed here well here in general here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:02.769
 so that is when they wear 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.519
 in such a position, that is, here you are driving 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.050
 so suddenly you wanted 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.490
 lower the dark glass 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:17.480
 you can remove it like this 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:20.840
 he did not interfere and put the yellow here but 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:25.250
 i will say so well done this thing 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.760
 I almost understand it seems to be lengthening 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.620
 on 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.290
 using her yes you can 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.240
 adjust bubble size if you have 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.700
 we are either small or big visor 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.710
 they are all different so you can drag off 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.080
 change the size of what we have written here 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.500
 let's try to look here think 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.750
 nothing interesting 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.850
 in general here is such a visor all links 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:02.930
 will be in the description on the seller I think 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.500
 This is not glass , after all, from plastic judging 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.500
 by sound 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.030
 I think some kind of plastic on anything like 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:18.620
 think these scratches are good here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.090
 There is this on the film under the film like 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.820
 everything is whole 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:31.570
 well let's move on to the next package 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:34.780
 here, as if the seller wrote to us 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:38.180
 bracelet here before power balance bracelet 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.460
 Chinese non-original quite and kind 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:46.430
 there was some 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:50.030
 the basketball team in my green 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:56.540
 colors or something let's rate 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:58.550
 by the way 2 dollars 0 2 dollars well 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:04.160
 it costs somewhere like this 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:08.060
 A dollar with a penny, see it all the same 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.120
 u put in a box with such a box 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:15.800
 this whole thing has come but a box to us to 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.080
 Unfortunately, it did not reach 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.780
 rather, he didnâ€™t even fold it 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.380
 apparently just the position because you 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.940
 you drink 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.100
 here these angles are not bent means it like 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.230
 as if the type for sale can even 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:35.450
 Expose here that is, she comes already 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.060
 the box did not hesitate, they did not even 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.150
 fold and send m so let's 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:47.680
 look until the green color here they are and you 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:56.450
 as if the logo of the basketball team 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:07:02.950
 let's take all sorts of things here 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:06.730
 the pictures on the back too 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:11.510
 site by the way power balance dot com 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:14.600
 the original sense of the present is such 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:20.450
 small bracelet small size 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:25.970
 he has holograms and see the logo with 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:29.360
 the logo here is also pretty good 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.770
 made here look power balance 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.770
 with reverse countries
