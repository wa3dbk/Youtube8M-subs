 20 of my playstation 1 collection too 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 this is slowly coming to an end 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.800
 but now we have a few more 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 play games and the fastest one now 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.250
 yes there were still people who have ten 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 games collected like me or still doing 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 because with the playstation 1 babies too 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 I was really missing the game 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 but of course it was the games 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.279
 in front 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.800
 as always, a piece in a park counts for that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.980
 first game butcher 99 by ea sports 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.350
 is a teenager a game it has one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 nice look in the area and it has 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 a reason why I bought that at the time 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 I used to have that, that was it 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 was now 99 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.309
 I did that at 98, we did 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
 the playstation 1 at the video behind 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 stuck and have so many duels 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.440
 is I made my brother Buddy's name 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 im added 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.989
 no idea why it was in the car 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.149
 just cool is how we get together 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.190
 then always delivered against sexual 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 have and butcher has a lot of fun me 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 even if the controls were very heavy 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.840
 and then I have some point that was 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.260
 This load music in the ear of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.240
 comparatively the game for five mark 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.830
 that was taken with five d-mark 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.420
 we took everything with us a bit 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 but not really alone 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.200
 then played a game yes i know i 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 me as a collector and also fit the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.070
 that was my game I had 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.229
 my judith merchant machines v3 from 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.299
 get aesthetic 10 10 10 of 10 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 by generation '9 percent and by the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 Megafonen gold we go all magazines 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.360
 there is no longer the game already 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.049
 half micro machines one has so small 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.280
 cars later half horse half in the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.479
 kitchen on the table too 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.399
 Pool table in the ceiling but too much 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.790
 multitabs and then that's always the case 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.820
 the last one disappears behind 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.219
 then he is gone that is then goes no one 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.600
 More there is the one I won 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.460
 There was a lot of fun back then 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.619
 super nintendo mega drive I think 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 but today I do not like it anymore 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.020

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.910
 second part homemade micro - 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.880

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.110
 cars more but these little figures 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.660
 One day you could use buggies 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.460
 drive panzer here you just run on 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.650
 record player carrera train but 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.210
 I never played, I'm sure 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.740
 being funny is also too much play with 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.240
 the multi path even up to eight players 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.000
 if you have two multi tech he has one 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.400
 multi partie four connections alone only 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.490
 One and yes I think I have none 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.990
 many people would play with me 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.930
 then tell them if the genes 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:50.510
 optics or so then a game 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.510
 the 24 hours of le mans a racing game 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.500
 summer so it is a little bit in ps1 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.790
 bad but I have that better 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.580
 playing on the jerseys makes me more 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.600
 fun on the pc also a nice look 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.220
 I also had change at night 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.720
 a lot of fun but also the the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.760
 cast gave it to me like it better because it 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 Yes, even computer opponents were still there 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.170
 just sure to be very nice but 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.970
 if you have the opportunity quite nice 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.470
 like now like to sell strategy game 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.820
 what was missing then but today 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.670
 I think that was stupid 2000 or 2001 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.050
 100 of the man had as much 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.630
 remember nor can one also had this 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.980
 factory at the panzerbauer there's but 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.080
 but I no soldiers that has me 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.370
 With it drew days festival is a car around 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.200
 point until we got further 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.440
 but I do not know if that again 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.240
 played are the stupid ok today 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.970
 shows that as a child many things 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.610
 nice, so I do not like it 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.800
 not anymore so that's why these are 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.650
 Albus series has been the cheaper 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.910
 was kind of partial to then play the 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.000
 I also get a recommendation from one 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.700
 magazine also bought though playstation 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.410
 danger girl thq is a comic implementation 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
 he has good grades then i come 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.480
 he thought he would not be bad 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.660
 like p &amp; g version but puff cake / 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.010
 Control optics without the skate 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.260
 I have pocket money for that at the time 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.620
 I have spent a rhythmization 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.010
 plays what was so stupid so there we come 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.900
 guido guido is a kind of rage 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.610
 and do not play this character here 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.789
 outside this woman 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.789
 drink and this rotary goes to two 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.759
 player again sweet suite of trade has 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.379
 still where it was really fun 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.659
 So multi-tech is also four 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.590
 against each other 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.629
 but we have two playmates 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.009
 story moscow play and that was very 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.110
 good but also very hard I have 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.319
 I still remembered that time 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.889
 bought at music in the ear that was a 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:57.569
 aggressive 479 euro 99 d-mark yes found 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.669
 At that time I was very good and visually it was 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.840
 a very good thing almost at king force that 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.939
 was also a good game at least the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.210
 first part still in twos in the direction 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.189
 is that also a game what 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.919
 bad rating but got me 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.379
 very well liked apartment has blake 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.819
 to play here the man has the did and 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.199
 The woman Kathrin I have with the man 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.759
 with it still played by the woman 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.789
 not you can stop two times 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.650
 play through then there's still me 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.659
 is also the case designed by the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.219
 metal gear and time filmmaker he's so good 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.199
 is not that now but i believe that 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.779
 backgrounds were calculated and the 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.979
 graphic was good too bloody I liked it a lot 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.569
 well-liked actually in 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.099
 control with the camera not so 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.020
 optimal but I liked it very much 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.490
 I can also in velen actually so 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.659
 So I liked the man 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.039
 I really wanted to be thirsty again 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.139
 would be another then 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.490
 Difficulties know it yes think what 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.460
 then everything else sometimes forgets 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.860
 who wants to keep playing 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.900
 then a row that is not good 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.930
 arrived in the west is psycho force 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.639

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.029
 Germany has a very awesome anime 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.060
 intro one plays so one is so one 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:11.759
 Cube locked up and then you stop 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.979
 a figure one of the country he has 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.509
 for example, fire attacks king then 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.479
 there is still one with her and what 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.189
 reads and samurai with electricity can me 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.349
 good at getting rating so 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.889
 between 55 now have time very well 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.330

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.740
 I liked and appeared 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:38.209
 then what came out came 2000 or so or 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.209
 99 also has to look 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.280
 In 2000, the second part is sold out 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.730

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.580

 Well the hamptons liked it again 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.550

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.380
 cool 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.380

 two parts good clinker stones actually 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.550
