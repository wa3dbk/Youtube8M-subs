I know this is a Vantage but it's got a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.080 
I know this is a Vantage but it's got a
little<00:02:01.570> s<00:02:01.690> bad<00:02:01.990> what<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.610> does<00:02:03.820> that

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
little s bad what is that it does that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.330 
little s bad what is that it does that
this<00:02:04.180> is<00:02:04.420> really<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.930> tuned<00:02:05.320> version<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.070> the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.400 
this is really a tuned version of the
Vantage<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:07.300> really<00:02:07.720> aiming<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.259> bring

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
Vantage and it's really aiming to bring

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.590 
Vantage and it's really aiming to bring
all<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.979> track<00:02:09.220> heritage<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.880> Aston<00:02:10.209> Martin

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
all the track heritage that Aston Martin

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
all the track heritage that Aston Martin
has<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.470> they've<00:02:11.680> achieved<00:02:11.800> into<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.550> road

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
has that they've achieved into a road

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.000 
has that they've achieved into a road
car<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.420> suppose<00:02:14.050> if<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.590> look<00:02:14.739> at<00:02:14.860> like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
car I suppose if you have a look at like

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.280 
car I suppose if you have a look at like
Nuerburgring<00:02:15.280> 24<00:02:16.030> hours<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.600> LMP<00:02:17.050> ones

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
Nuerburgring 24 hours with the LMP ones

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.490 
Nuerburgring 24 hours with the LMP ones
that<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> Vantage<00:02:18.850> v12<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.780> v8<00:02:20.380> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
that it was the Vantage v12 and v8 so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.600 
that it was the Vantage v12 and v8 so
they'll<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:20.709> using<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> guess

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
they'll be using for that so I guess

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.309 
they'll be using for that so I guess
they<00:02:21.760> do<00:02:21.819> have<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.090> lot<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.239> cheque<00:02:22.540> knowledge

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
they do have a lot of cheque knowledge

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.360 
they do have a lot of cheque knowledge
and<00:02:23.440> history<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.770> how<00:02:23.830> does<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.069> equate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and history but how does that equate

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.010 
and history but how does that equate
into<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.790> car<00:02:25.060> well<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> pity<00:02:25.840> because

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
into this car well it's a pity because

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.449 
into this car well it's a pity because
we<00:02:26.260> can't<00:02:26.470> put<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.890> track<00:02:27.160> we're<00:02:27.340> not

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
we can't put it on a track we're not

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.509 
we can't put it on a track we're not
allowed<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.959> terms<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.950> exterior

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
allowed to but in terms of the exterior

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.070 
allowed to but in terms of the exterior
it's<00:02:30.940> got<00:02:31.209> bigger<00:02:31.480> wheels<00:02:31.720> its

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
it's got bigger wheels its

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.990 
it's got bigger wheels its
aerodynamically<00:02:33.040> different<00:02:33.519> just<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.820> terms

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
aerodynamically different just in terms

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.150

I<00:02:49.300> think<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.590> giving<00:02:50.890> us<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.220> let<00:02:51.700> more

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
I think that is giving us that let more

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.759 
I think that is giving us that let more

that<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.430> pity<00:02:57.610> because<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.180> me<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.390> seems

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
that is the pity because for me it seems

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240 
that is the pity because for me it seems
like<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:58.989> where<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.260> car<00:02:59.470> should<00:02:59.739> go<00:02:59.980> no

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
like this is where that car should go no

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.350

they've done a lot of work on the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.300 
they've done a lot of work on the
steering<00:03:01.660> getting<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> weighting<00:03:02.980> right<00:03:03.160> so

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310

steering getting the weighting right so
you're<00:03:03.489> gonna<00:03:03.579> notice

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
you're gonna notice

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.990 
you're gonna notice
turning<00:03:06.439> on<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.769> really<00:03:07.280> really<00:03:07.459> good<00:03:07.790> I

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000

just let's get a bit frustrated driving

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.670 
just let's get a bit frustrated driving
it<00:03:10.849> like<00:03:11.000> we<00:03:11.150> are<00:03:11.180> now<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.780> town<00:03:12.230> setting

great on the steering wheel and it is
better<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.980> you're<00:03:40.220> driving<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.700> slowly

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
better but if you're driving it slowly

amazing<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.579> handle<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.120> think<00:04:17.269> people

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
amazing the handle but I think people

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.759 
amazing the handle but I think people
are<00:04:17.600> gonna<00:04:17.690> win<00:04:17.959> too<00:04:18.109> about<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.380> clunkiness

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
are gonna win too about the clunkiness

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.710 
are gonna win too about the clunkiness
or<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.070> gearbox<00:04:19.459> but<00:04:19.640> it<00:04:20.180> reminds<00:04:20.540> me<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
or the gearbox but it reminds me of the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.450 
or the gearbox but it reminds me of the
GTR<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.500> can<00:04:21.650> actually<00:04:21.799> hear<00:04:22.160> with

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
GTR because you can actually hear with

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.680 
GTR because you can actually hear with
the<00:04:22.550> transmission<00:04:22.940> being<00:04:23.240> right<00:04:23.419> there<00:04:23.630> you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the transmission being right there you

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.780 
the transmission being right there you
can<00:04:23.810> actually<00:04:23.930> hear<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.680> gears<00:04:25.100> engaging<00:04:25.520> but

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
can actually hear the gears engaging but

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.700 
can actually hear the gears engaging but

bring<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:56.350> yeah<00:04:57.350> we've<00:04:57.590> struggled<00:04:57.860> with<00:04:58.130> a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
bring it yeah we've struggled with a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.800 
bring it yeah we've struggled with a
navigation<00:04:58.610> system<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.300> easiest<00:04:59.600> in<00:04:59.750> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
navigation system not the easiest in the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.390 
navigation system not the easiest in the
world<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.110> get<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.440> pop<00:05:00.590> up<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:00.979> down<00:05:01.130> it's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
world to get it to pop up and down it's

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.640 
world to get it to pop up and down it's
and<00:05:01.760> although<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:03.020> an<00:05:03.140> advanced

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
and although this is an advanced

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.920 
and although this is an advanced
navigation<00:05:03.890> system<00:05:04.640> it's<00:05:04.820> an<00:05:05.360> improvement<00:05:05.720> on

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
navigation system it's an improvement on

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.450 
navigation system it's an improvement on
the<00:05:05.990> old<00:05:06.260> one<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.620> it<00:05:06.710> made<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:07.040> try<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.760> yeah

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
the old one so it made to try that yeah

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.830 
the old one so it made to try that yeah
but<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.210> know<00:05:09.300> what<00:05:09.420> Lindsay<00:05:09.690> there's

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
but you know what Lindsay there's

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.230 
but you know what Lindsay there's
something<00:05:10.110> we<00:05:10.230> have<00:05:10.380> we<00:05:10.710> haven't<00:05:11.010> mentioned

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
something we have we haven't mentioned

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.080 
something we have we haven't mentioned
it<00:05:12.240> does<00:05:12.480> sound<00:05:12.860> absolutely<00:05:13.860> amazing<00:05:14.490> does<00:05:14.730> he

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
it does sound absolutely amazing does he

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.960 
it does sound absolutely amazing does he
hit<00:05:15.210> three<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:15.540> a<00:05:15.600> half<00:05:15.720> years<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:17.100> man

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
hit three and a half years and this man

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.710 
hit three and a half years and this man
will<00:05:18.240> stop<00:05:18.510> John<00:05:19.370> sure<00:05:20.370> we<00:05:20.460> hit<00:05:20.550> sports<00:05:20.940> and

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
will stop John sure we hit sports and

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.090 
will stop John sure we hit sports and
then<00:05:21.840> we<00:05:21.930> started<00:05:22.230> using<00:05:22.440> these<00:05:22.680> design

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
then we started using these design

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.400 
then we started using these design
pedals<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:23.820> then<00:05:24.210> finally<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.840> reason<00:05:25.050> why

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
pedals and then finally the reason why

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.060 
pedals and then finally the reason why
it's<00:05:25.620> an<00:05:25.770> S<00:05:25.980> become<00:05:26.760> super<00:05:27.210> super<00:05:27.600> parents<00:05:28.110> so

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
it's an S become super super parents so

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.660 
it's an S become super super parents so
we<00:05:29.160> ever<00:05:29.310> listen<00:05:29.640> yeah
