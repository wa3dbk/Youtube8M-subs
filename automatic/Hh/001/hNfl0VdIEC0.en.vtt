00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.220
 but between welcome saga of all levels 2 the clicks that there are in this 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.320
 I just did the video 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.149
 a number I do not know what 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.039
 is that the truth is no longer with a crow today 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.089
 I think he lives this is the 12 I'm not very sure but hey 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.070
 this increase is cooking 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.460
 but the point is that in the last wine I say that I did not think 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.519
 no tourist 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 but what I was going to do and by cedice and I'm missing enough 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.109
 then 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.279
 but enough I think not more than five but good 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.460
 very funny and good that you have them 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.840
 in fact and before tomic 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.590
 resist 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.390
 do they work 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.560
 it's for safari 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.960
 transformations of the foal 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.180
 2 5 and I'm going to cut them 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 and I'm going to spread two hours 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.300
 this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.370
 well let's open safari first 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 to show you 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.180
 if they see the pages they are 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.930
 accommodated in a different way than they normally are 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.330
 that appears here a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.260
 big screen consumption 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.430
 with the page they have open 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 and you can swipe to see the other pages perez tezanos a mode a 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.920
 little better and more 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.940
 organized 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.500
 d as versus 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 your pages 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 besides that here you can grab them and move and change places 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.920
 this with ayala opened a new 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.430
 a new page 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.609
 it appears to them like she writes 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.950
 what you need 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640
 and it leaves everything else not 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 no then well this is very easy 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.670
 the llanito I tell you as the two names 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700
 I just explain the following 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.870
 click I'm going to show you also 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.110
 how do you see min 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.510
 nikon west 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.540
 is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.650
 up here 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.110
 this one is lost by bars 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 and put it where I want 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.780
 and no need to create this folders good blank applications or things 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.550
 A) Yes 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.790
 those are nonsense and right now he taught them how to really 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 how to do this very easily 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.350
 that is decided by a program where there are several programs to create the folders 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.589
 blank and all that 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:14.560
 this 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 that in addition to everything because it is occupy visual memory you can 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.509
 day by day 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.409
 and can be 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.409
 then genius goal of common women 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.019
 of this one among one to be looking for the other 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.129
 very funny complaint 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.719
 hilario c not even because I look for the first but good point is looking for the 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.929
 first my find the two 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.489
 so 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.459
 good and let's chia has been made in syria 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.099
 nor the changes 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 the conservative 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.319
 we seek to include 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.379
 this is the first and it is the one that is on the home screen your home screen 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.159
 is the one that lets you put your icons where you want on your screen 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:06.999
 you need very little 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.959
 because good costs and is type 2 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.989
 This for this one would pay but unfortunately when the other had 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.169
 no money so I had to look for the wipo 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.349
 for the fact there is to look for it because day 3 of April it could not lower of its son 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.219
 this 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.129
 then good 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.029
 of state or why 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.029
 just let me do something 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.459
 this bonus 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.319
 they simply seek to cover 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.369
 and that already disappeared the result they need 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.069
 this state I'm not too sure that the 'u' and possess 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.439
 this point is adapted 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.939
 figuera point 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.179
 dot sex dotcom 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:57.809
 p could also be Syrian pointed to the dotcom but good 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.140
 by the way and for not 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.680
 Do not get into doubts just download it from another pri pop and I will also give them 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.039
 that is roses textile 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.929
 the program in that very little 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.339
 the wipo is called 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.069
 public ajax 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.669
 as you see it here 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.479
 ajax hol and postponing t I know more a very good very well organized 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.549
 and all 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.340
 this then they simply itch 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.349
 i 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.050
 the state 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.029
 they wait so little 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.029
 caride the rest wins and confirm 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.900
 this 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.599
 he also occupied a little bit of reason 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:34.539
 but good 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.539
 It's very little and it's worth what it does 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.169
 without need to 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.750
 and other programs that whistle at us occupied very little memory in general thing 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.050
 he occupied very little reason 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.080
 and very little memory in his arc 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.430
 the is good is very very good sight 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.639
 this cult thing I do not know why it does not drain before 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.470
 and then sliding down I came across this cover 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.639
 forza farley 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.779
 this one that he takes needs wipo 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.610
 and so are people 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.990
 of detection the iss 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.000
 that I think goes out 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.469
 ap this point made the dotcom 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.749
 yes it is not the 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.650
 the dot point exo the dotcom 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.930
 and if none of those works 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.039
 struck out on a note 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.310
 you can download it from the jack swing pop dotcom those two octopuses are the most 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:26.249
 reliable in which it may be that they are all three that had already 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.240
 taught 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.580
 he told them equal those names in the description that 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.889
 percent those very possible the names of the 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.139
 things of those that designing them 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.389
 then well just likewise in the other 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.550
 they touch it they install 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.439
 and confirm 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.249
 here this one occupied a little bit more than one died but only while in use 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.039
 not all the time 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.759
 Of course they have to close the 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.499
 the task to whom 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.580
 p 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.610
 in the multitasking they have to close the safari task so that it stops occupying 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.869
 the rams 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.219
 those things 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.980
 Well, that's it, they've already seen how everything works then 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.430
 now until now I know that I am missing others 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.969
 others at least two 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.520
 200 more 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.740
 the goals of the alpendre ante 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.099
 of all the other videos read the description has important things already 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:20.979
 they know 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.999
 this among them know the good I believe it and estimated dismissal
