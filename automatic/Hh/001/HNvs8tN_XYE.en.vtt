00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it would really help if your left

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.100

wingers<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> foot<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:36.900> right

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
wingers right foot and if you're right

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.270 
wingers right foot and if you're right
wing<00:01:37.320> goes<00:01:37.439> left<00:01:37.650> foot<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.009> every<00:01:38.250> time

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
wing goes left foot so every time

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.350 
wing goes left foot so every time
they're<00:01:38.549> cutting<00:01:38.850> they're<00:01:38.970> always<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.329> a

they're cutting they're always on a
strong<00:01:39.720> foot<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.560> paste<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> most

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
strong foot but paste is the most

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.670 
strong foot but paste is the most
important<00:01:42.000> stat<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> your<00:01:42.659> own<00:01:42.960> Wiggins

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
piercings run on the wings and then

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
piercings run on the wings and then
cross<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> maybe<00:01:47.700> not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
