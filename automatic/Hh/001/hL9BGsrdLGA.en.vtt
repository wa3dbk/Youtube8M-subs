00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.439
 hello tells you Jorge to learn to 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.929
 driving like this are lives that do not 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.669
 they have subscribers in which they tell me 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.440
 who wants to know how I should throw 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.280
 reverse on slope and when 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.230
 soon does not find 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.390
 there is no way to throw forward / 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.900
 sanitary backing down it's 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 good for us it 's the other way around 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.090
 pending because the only thing that has to be 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.520
 here or the best thing that would play would be 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.470
 to leave it in neutral a brake yes 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.440
 you have to keep in mind that the mirrors 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.660
 all of them must be very well located 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.340
 mirrors that the vehicle has is by 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.660
 internal the left sides and 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.140
 right 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.640
 so you know your way very well 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.800
 apart from your should also look 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.920
 backwards in this case there is not much 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.900
 congestion to do it upside down 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.150
 He deserved what I have here carmen to 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.220
 Next was'm not so off the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.350
 from the platform but I'm seeing the platform 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.420
 I can paste a little more of the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.010
 reference that I need to try to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 locate it 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.060
 If there was a lot of confusion they would have to 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 do it very slowly then only 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 the car is left in neutral 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.110
 it gets garden entered and we start to throw 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.230
 reverse 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 always releasing a bit the brake that 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.370
 I'm looking at that mirror and looking at the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.110
 mirror of berlin and I have as reference 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.330
 the angel there that will not go up 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.560
 to the platform and not that I'm going to get 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.640
 much to the lane on the side here 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.640
 taking advantage of returning very slowly 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 hours 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.159
 If you already know only brake and be very 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.329
 pending and not doing it very fast the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.659
 pending that at this moment we have 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.659
 here 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.450
 remember ahead 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.340
 and not invading the other's poster 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 and another very important thing also that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.050
 it would be good having already put lights of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.450
 I 'm parking because there's no parking 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.450
 reverse before they do not turn white 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.430
 we have parking for the subject with 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 matter is supposed to before returning 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.450
 there are people who are still going through 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.450
 now then so that they have more 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.580
 caution of your presence 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.739
 but better than learn to drive and you 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.360
 I'm going to show what the view would be 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.360
 we had to have from the mirrors 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.070
 well we continue with the video of 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.590
 reversing on a slope and I said 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.410
 we leave the car in neutral that is 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.210
 completely neutral if only it is a 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.420
 brake work that is what you're going to 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.030
 to brake and be very aware of the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.090
 line 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.319
 from the other lane 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.200
 you can see here that is the line 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.510
 will not invade the lane and on the other 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.389
 mirror you will have as reference the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.870
 platform there we go let's start 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.550
 reverse 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.350
 I'm going to put park lights 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.130
 stationary waves 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.380
 in the feet they observe 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.700
 this in order to be more 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.410
 notorious 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.560
 before the people who come if they come 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.069
 people 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.150
 we look that I have this reference as a reference 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.099
 standard allows not to invade the other 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.700
 lane and right there observe that no 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.700
 invade 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.960
 very well 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.330
 reverse 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.410
 always where is a friday distance 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.870
 30 centimeters approximately no 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.680
 I would have no problem do this way 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.680
 very slow 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 ready 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.900
 very slow 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.400
 then remember in this video what it says 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.140
 at the request of a subscriber who said 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.300
 how should I reverse it in 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.700
 pending is the recommendation that I go 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.200
 to do them very slowly from 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.660
 do not invade the other lane 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.930
 and that is as he told me in a month 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.610
 by adic or because he can not continue because 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.100
 there's a lot of confusion ahead, it's not 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.590
 learn with 27 remember that the 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.840
 people who want them to do 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.730
 questions should enable the part of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 answer on your channel or if you do not 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.200
 I can answer in the next one it will be better 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.270
 What to learn to drive please 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.230
 share that information from someone a 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.230
 links and then the video
