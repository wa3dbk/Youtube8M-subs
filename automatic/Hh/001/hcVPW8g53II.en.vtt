evolution<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.539> brand<00:00:22.050> new<00:00:22.230> camera<00:00:22.560> so

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
evolution this is a brand new camera so

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.500 
evolution this is a brand new camera so
let's<00:00:23.160> hit<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> highlights<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> what

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
let's hit the highlights on it what

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.330 
let's hit the highlights on it what
makes<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.350> different<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:26.010> front<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
makes this so different from front to
