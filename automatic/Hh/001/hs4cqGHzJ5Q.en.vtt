00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:19.699
 sent to users shook 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:22.669
 here it means here we are today 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.970
 canned food will fool that one bank 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.659
 that the second is pork but 1 is ours 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 gubernatorial porridge that one that 2 from 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:34.280
 Ltd 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.000
 sing loss cough means governor 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.000
 with pork 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.250
 so-so-so-so-so on Chelyabinsk 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.400
 the photo area is sharp here 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.250
 say what was written here because 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.850
 that half was sealed 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:02.000
 Well, that is, in principle, api 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.159
 I don't see the amount of meat again 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.340
 be like the previous mascara are n't they 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.570
 there may be a lack 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.700
 maybe the opposite will be very good 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 new what I say did reviews 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.079
 Belarusian anime porridge on the contrary is very 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.969
 liked although as I said not 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.439
 times if you watched my reviews 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:28.060
 then the Belarusian basically stews somewhere 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.800
 at 50 percent they 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 turd so to speak 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.280
 but you can hear the dirt today will review 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.500
 cashier wiring and 2 we have jars of pork 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.690
 canned meat stew 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.040
 simple ossovskaya top grade written 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.890
 best miss my product russian 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.690
 Federation of 2010 is here an icon 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 I don't know how it seems to me that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.600
 In principle, this icon can be trusted. 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.890
 that to some extent he does not lie so 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.860
 so so so so again bookmark meat i 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.660
 don't see but pork let's be 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 try not start with this pork 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.130
 stew again I'll be today 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.590
 open with your venger because as 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.680
 opener he did not really like 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.480
 here I have not used it 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.620
 a few years of the mind so lies on the shelf 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:31.990
 as a memory, some kind of principle father gave 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 Now I took 8 popolzovalsya here too 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:42.940
 I like the smell of fine wines 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 probably quite a bunch and we are now 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:53.709
 open the pork stew by the way here I am 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.220
 Hungarian recently opened even banks 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.810
 here and he is absolutely not a coach that is 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.450
 This is probably wedging 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.800
 due to the fact that the bank is still bent here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.850
 there are some distortions in the bank and therefore 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.850
 completely uncomfortable passage 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.630
 So 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:27.830
 I actually see him 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.830
 Myasko is a piece of meat 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.890
 Now I will and I'll show you tune in 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.050
 Unlike previous review previous 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.280
 review 1 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.990
 By the way, here too, the spouse looked and 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.960
 says well how can there be such pork 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.440
 red is the natural color 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.440
 pork 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.410
 it tastes like a completely different soul 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.950
 you know i'm in a very auditory plug and i 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.950
 got scared 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.230
 it's fat 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.200
 this again 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.750
 it's a victim again 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.870
 and this is fat 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.870
 it's fat 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.230
 it's fat 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.240
 unclear 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.190
 same 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.360
 not 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:49.020
 this meat is not a relationship 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.020
 all fat fat 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.610
 I 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.849
 so let the limbs play sound 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.849
 back 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.060
 after all we will see how much stew is in 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:17.340
 useful meat principle is clear by quite 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:17.340
 normal but honestly all banks 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.490
 evsino banks we have 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:36.550
 tablespoon meat will be given body 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:40.849
 ok but his month is fat too 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.539
 through that's what's mine this is meat from 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.000
 whole can 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:48.800
 but this whole bank is wide close 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.470
 gruel like I said like in a fairy tale 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.319
 which I tried before were very 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.009
 good and even here is Russian me 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.020
 sent 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:02.300
 I completely forgot the potato and meat dock 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.789
 the chef is kind of like she's not called 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.190
 I remember popped out of his head but did not judge and 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:11.259
 there she was pretty tasty too 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.259
 that's awkward and normal 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:27.870
 already we will be well apart from that 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:32.910
 gruel why shield 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:34.740
 smell just barley smell and and of course 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.040
 it is necessary to eat I'll try not heated 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.040
 such 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.610
 principle 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.610
 taste barley porridge but the most interesting 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.380
 you know I used to smoke sometimes kalya 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.610
 started smoking smoking cigarettes without 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.780
 filter and now it happened tobacco got about 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.660
 some aftertaste like it's 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.660
 big cigarette war 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.640
 such bitterness this but it is 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.170
 some taste of tobacco is a little bit well 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.470
 damn pork nothing bad to say 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.420
 I can mess here 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:27.610
 porridge as if with some pate or 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.910
 something else you can eat it but it tastes 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.920
 very nothing 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.930
 just the rate of ration for one person 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:41.080
 this jar is enough for me 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:43.900
 business model of the shadow of which cost a bit 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.370
 not even bad to throw out and I will not 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.090
 there we see that here is the same thing 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:53.140
 here that is, this porridge is perfect 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:59.280
 normal here is this whole stew 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:01.330
 the cans were about a canteen 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.840
 actually all thanks to all 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.840
 for your attention
