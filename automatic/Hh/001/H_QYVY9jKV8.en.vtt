 it has been a religious social indicator and five of professional status 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.669
 the importance of hair dates back to the Neolithic period 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.289
 about five thousand years ago in ancient egypt the sons of the pharaohs 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.169
 they carried a kind of fact there was behind the ear on the right side 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:19.969

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:01.829
 condition 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.709
 in ancient egypt when the hair began to fall men and rode 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.509
 in the head farm of furry animals 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.749
 before Christ Hippocrates famous for his wisdom noticed that his hair 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:17.309

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.349
 ancestors who frustrated decided to create wigs 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.709
 in August and accessories that concealed his baldness 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.529
 for example Julius Caesar who was bald and whose name ironically means 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.019
 head full of hairs 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.059
 covered his head with a laurel wreath to camouflage the absence of 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.899
 hair 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.800
 There are those who say that history will never give enough credit Sep 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.100
 that it took an hour daily for Caesar's crown to shine 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.660
 She asked the man who was bringing her the security and assurance that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.529
 the conqueror required 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.909
 then to this day scientists have been given the task of 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.949
 find an effective treatment for baldness 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.979
 to talk about the alternatives available today 15 the famous to 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.389
 mint for the jara with doctor arturo sandoval toast sandoval as it is

 he did it in the temple 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.969
 it is surgically treated xoom truth about the other 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.229
 is the surgical treatment 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.080
 the treatment with medicines certainly has its doubts fifa the way 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.830
 effective and a large percentage of patients 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.150
 we know that there is an attempt to mediate common baldness 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.690
 medications and possible elements deviations and so on since 400 years 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.860
 before Christ as a record of this 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.969
 however, until today 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.639
 and in our opinion there is no medicine that can for the inmates and 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.830
 we know 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490
 that the calm and without that it will give him room through internet 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.400
 we previously considered illogically in the field of medicine 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.509
 that an injury 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.669
 a medication or something can avoid 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.559
 percent and that this gene 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:11.649
 know the characteristics with which they live by saying labeled is not 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:12.800
 reversible 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.360
 the consumption of medications that there is currently a medication 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.830
 nothing more than from last year came out in Mexico 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.430

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.020
 does not produce hair 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.460
 really this is one of the medications possibly the one 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.499
 we have in effect although not 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.379
 the cost-benefit really 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.969
 it is not very justified 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.819
 and then do not send messages on the market for about five years 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.370

 without graft-based treatment 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.240
 which a hostile world with grafts 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.480
 we can say to the patient in particular that it shows is a credit 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.059
 different graft we use in transplants - a 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.360
