00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
fucked up oh and on another advice would

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.060 
fucked up oh and on another advice would
be<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.310> stay<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.509> left<00:01:19.810> where<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.590> bar<00:01:20.829> is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
be to stay to the left where that bar is

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.910 
be to stay to the left where that bar is

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
so they won't shoot you so you have less

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.270 
so they won't shoot you so you have less
clear<00:01:25.799> line-of-sight

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
clear line-of-sight

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.490 
clear line-of-sight
or<00:01:27.640> whatever<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.299> can<00:01:28.450> shoot<00:01:28.600> at<00:01:28.780> them<00:01:28.930> cuz

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
or whatever so you can shoot at them cuz

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.810 
or whatever so you can shoot at them cuz
if<00:01:29.619> you're<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:29.920> middle<00:01:30.159> they're<00:01:30.579> gonna<00:01:30.700> be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
if you're in the middle they're gonna be

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.310 
if you're in the middle they're gonna be
shooting<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.149> from<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.479> middle<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> back

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
shooting you from the middle the back

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.959 
shooting you from the middle the back
the<00:01:33.100> sides<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.850> front<00:01:33.880> everywhere<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.610> my

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
the sides the front everywhere so my

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.580 
the sides the front everywhere so my
advice<00:01:37.149> would<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:37.390> be<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.659> keep<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.320> side

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
advice would just be to keep to the side

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.260 
advice would just be to keep to the side
and<00:01:38.860> shoot<00:01:39.100> straight<00:01:39.369> for<00:01:39.640> cuz<00:01:39.909> they'll<00:01:40.060> move

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
and shoot straight for cuz they'll move

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.359 
and shoot straight for cuz they'll move
to<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.049> can<00:01:41.200> move<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.829> little<00:01:41.890> bit<00:01:42.250> out

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
to you and you can move a little bit out

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.179 
to you and you can move a little bit out
of<00:01:42.490> cover<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.909> shoot<00:01:43.149> them<00:01:43.299> but<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:45.100> know

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
of cover to shoot them but you know
