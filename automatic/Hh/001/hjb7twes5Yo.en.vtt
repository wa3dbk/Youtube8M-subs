00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
open with one hand if the knife face is
down<00:00:52.399> because<00:00:54.140> my<00:00:55.140> finger<00:00:55.440> isn't<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.969> long

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
down because my finger isn't that long

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:06.200 
down because my finger isn't that long
enough<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:59.430> open<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.879> easily<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:05.180> try<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
open it and I finally found a way which

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
open it and I finally found a way which
is<00:01:09.840> instead<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> facing<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> knife<00:01:11.549> down

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is instead of facing the knife down

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.740 
is instead of facing the knife down
you're<00:01:12.600> facing<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.939> now<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.509> easy

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you're facing it up now that that's easy

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
you're facing it up now that that's easy
for<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.170> open<00:01:16.320> very<00:01:16.920> easy<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.369> move<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:17.790> for

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
for me to open very easy to move or for

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
for me to open very easy to move or for
me<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> open<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> knife<00:01:19.280> with<00:01:20.280> knife<00:01:20.460> facing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
me to open the knife with knife facing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
me to open the knife with knife facing
up<00:01:21.979> okay<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.460> let's<00:01:23.790> try<00:01:23.909> again<00:01:24.290> facing<00:01:25.290> down

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
hard it's in that high way because I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
hard it's in that high way because I
grew<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:32.600> high<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> normally<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.729> hard

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
grew up with high but normally it's hard

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.840 
grew up with high but normally it's hard
okay<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.290> finger<00:01:38.159> limit<00:01:39.409> okay

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
okay that's my finger limit okay

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.340 
okay that's my finger limit okay
but<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> same<00:01:43.049> position<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.909> up

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
but with the same position when going up

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.190 
but with the same position when going up
it's<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.500> much<00:01:46.890> easier

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.810 

another<00:01:50.890> thing<00:01:51.189> closing<00:01:51.729> online<00:01:52.090> knife<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.610> is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
around here because when it closes this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.550 
around here because when it closes this
is<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.850> position<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.420> will<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.110> close<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
is a position that will not close in a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.370 
is a position that will not close in a
finger<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.819> since<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.510> don't<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.019> long

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
finger but since I don't have that long

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.270 
finger but since I don't have that long
of<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.650> finger<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.220> usually<00:02:24.700> have<00:02:25.450> my<00:02:25.690> finger

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.180 
of a finger I usually have my finger
around<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.040> if<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.290> try<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> shake<00:02:33.040> it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
around here and if I try to shake it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.000 
around here and if I try to shake it
down<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:34.360> will<00:02:34.569> come<00:02:34.810> down<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.200> close<00:02:35.440> them<00:02:35.620> on
