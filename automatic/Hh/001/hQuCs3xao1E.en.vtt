 I personally found it 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.270
 then sometimes 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 it didn't work very well on my skin 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.170
 left it a little shiny 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.980

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.769
 and tonight I continued to use the products I know and with which I 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.349
 I feel good 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.559

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.659
 and 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.700
 yes but don't use these products because these products are 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.139

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.459
 tone of voice in quotation marks because an auto-negotiation way of writing 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.999
 a lot away 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:13.349
 who definitely wants to invite people like you 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.860
 just saw that this incontinent lille person 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.520

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:28.529
 I have the profile obviously the profile was created two two days before 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.520
 because obviously all of them block 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.930

 he asked me in comparison 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.919
 comparison 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.809
 and political forum, however, h &amp; m 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.699
 what I mean that I have no problem talking to this person who maybe has 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.839
 valid arguments 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.419
 however, the way to put oneself first I therefore expose myself to having seen it done 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.479
 something of you 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.719
 second thing 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.359
 it's not d's way of presenting your arguments if you really believe in 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.889
 what you say 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.960

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:20.689

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.969

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.110
 that was it 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.540
