00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.740
 good youtube as there will be 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.200
 several of you came out the new trailer 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.360
 of dark souls all so I already know 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.120
 confirmed I'm very happy about this wash 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 in bad industries actually comes today 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 home just to play a little show 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.329
 and ride people and fuck stop playing 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.880
 to investigate about this I have 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:24.789
 very, very good news first 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.130
 According to theories, I have been several 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.259
 environmental games of 300 or 400 years before 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.300
 of dark souls from the dark sign on the 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.010
 descendant of the piñero and it is said that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.050
 we will use the little pygmy and how it looked 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.559
 in the trailer the dragons unlike 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.780
 of the sun 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.890
 many will see the calamita in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.199
 the trailer unless all the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.150
 Dragons have a mean Heron not 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.280
 it can be nobody but him which 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.949
 it also means that this is a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.290
 prequel I have theories that the game 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.820
 could be and lamenting in thief and 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.949
 while leaving more places without Tolín 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.229
 unusual or visit places of order 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.869
 that we have not yet visited since in 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.610
 the trailer saw something very interesting in 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.100
 the world or village of the dead can 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.439
 appear and there may even be 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
 some live habitable cities with 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.830
 citizens it is clear that this does not 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.030
 means that the idea of ​​being alone in 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.440
 the world of the great ones has destroyed 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.500
 Clear 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.110
 This picador world is already coming to me 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.380
 trailer so to Norman very 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.170
 sure to appear and third but not 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.640
 less important not to live or not 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.200
 I know very well the timeline of this 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.610
 but I think that by that time the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 witch of shalit had not yet done the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.510
 catastrophe of the fact of chaos so 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.720
 might have no peep wrong if 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.460
 control with spells as was done before 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.770
 and the best part is that maybe they remove 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.660
 games for windows live visit the page 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.940
 of the sybase description below there is no 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.050
 brands of games for windows so it's 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.800
 possible that it is not on air in the 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.720
 pc version 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 this means that in steam either 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.610
 region avian blog will not 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.500
 repurchase the game is very possible that such 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.720
 once they improve online, maybe there's less 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.310
 the one in tve and the cooperative and I 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.380
 cooperative has been implemented better 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.020
 the option to conjure so that it is not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.940
 as difficult as before and well this is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.740
 everything in reality the trailer did not know 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.010
 many things try to find out the best 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.929
 that I could go and with those three theories of 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.750
 it was the fourth of games for windows and the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.420
 fifth of online and remember to give suns 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.220
 it's not just difficult it 's like a 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.340
 user of the news that they leave line in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.209
 the deep epic magic description 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.950
 immense and then if you want hard it is 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.430
 one of the best rpg that has ever existed 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.189
 until now 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.900
 maybe from the generation actually like that 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.430
 that I will be aware about this one and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.980
 will inform by newsletter or by see if 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.969
 besides things about the sun 2 I like it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.620
 subscribe and goodbye and messages the 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.319
 cooperative provision names together with 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.780
 any cooperative in any game 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.100
 a person is going to help you later 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.100
 the competitive function
