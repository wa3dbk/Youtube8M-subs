it splits open if it gets pressure
inside<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.640> I've<00:00:47.640> had<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> couple<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> these

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
inside it and I've had a couple of these

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
inside it and I've had a couple of these
cards<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> work<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.649> commercial<00:00:50.039> machines

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
cards at work in our commercial machines

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.290 
cards at work in our commercial machines
where<00:00:51.629> these<00:00:51.840> capacitors<00:00:52.760> dried<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
where these capacitors dried out and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.630 
where these capacitors dried out and
popped<00:00:54.600> open<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.140> had<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.320> replace<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.640> if

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
popped open I had to replace them so if

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.099 
popped open I had to replace them so if
you're<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> video<00:01:00.329> card<00:01:00.629> try<00:01:00.989> and

put my blinking covers in the back and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.510 
put my blinking covers in the back and
we<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> installing<00:02:02.070> windows<00:02:04.549> right

at<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.550> BIOS<00:02:16.910> here<00:02:20.590> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.800> nice<00:02:22.400> BIOS<00:02:22.940> on

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
at the BIOS here kind of a nice BIOS on

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:37.710 
at the BIOS here kind of a nice BIOS on
this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.090 

memory<00:02:38.440> channel<00:02:38.860> mode<00:02:39.040> dual<00:02:39.640> interleaved<00:02:41.100> so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
memory channel mode dual interleaved so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.790 
memory channel mode dual interleaved so
we're<00:02:42.250> running<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.640> dual<00:02:42.850> channel<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.620> want

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
we're running a dual channel so I want

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.020 
we're running a dual channel so I want
to<00:02:47.830> go<00:02:47.950> ahead<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.220> exit<00:02:48.580> now<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.880> know

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
to go ahead and exit now that I know

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
to go ahead and exit now that I know
everything<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.390> working

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.030 

and<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.710> will<00:03:04.920> proceed<00:03:05.130> with<00:03:05.370> Windows<00:03:05.940> setup

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
and we will proceed with Windows setup

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.990 
and we will proceed with Windows setup
right<00:03:08.040> now<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.410> 7:56<00:03:10.410> p.m.<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.790> I'm<00:03:11.880> going

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
right now it is 7:56 p.m. so I'm going

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.730 
right now it is 7:56 p.m. so I'm going
to<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.180> how<00:03:12.330> long<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> takes<00:03:12.660> from<00:03:13.440> this

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
to see how long it takes from this

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.130 
to see how long it takes from this
screen<00:03:14.070> until<00:03:14.460> I'm<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.940> desktop

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.300 

alright<00:03:19.140> we're<00:03:19.350> cruising<00:03:19.770> right<00:03:19.920> through<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
alright we're cruising right through the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.990 
alright we're cruising right through the
installation<00:03:20.910> process<00:03:22.490> let's<00:03:23.490> see<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:23.820> time

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
installation process let's see what time

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.540 
installation process let's see what time
it<00:03:24.060> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
it is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:34.130 
it is
it<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:27.350> 806<00:03:28.350> p.m.<00:03:30.530> only<00:03:31.530> been<00:03:31.800> 10<00:03:32.070> minutes<00:03:33.140> and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it is 806 p.m. only been 10 minutes and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.930 
it is 806 p.m. only been 10 minutes and
I'm<00:03:34.680> easily<00:03:34.890> more<00:03:35.250> than<00:03:35.370> halfway<00:03:35.520> done

running out of space in my memory card
here<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.400> I'm<00:03:45.490> going<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.730> come<00:03:46.540> back<00:03:46.750> as<00:03:46.960> soon

as this is nearing the end it's only

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.680 
as this is nearing the end it's only
been<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.900> few<00:03:53.170> seconds<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:55.060> already<00:03:55.600> to

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
been a few seconds it's already to

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:07.210 
been a few seconds it's already to
reboot

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.840 

this<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> first<00:04:08.360> boot<00:04:08.630> up<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:10.580> it's<00:04:10.730> going

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
this is the first boot up so it's going

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.970 
this is the first boot up so it's going
to<00:04:10.940> do<00:04:11.090> some<00:04:11.300> more<00:04:11.480> preparation<00:04:11.950> before<00:04:12.950> I

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
to do some more preparation before I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.730 
to do some more preparation before I
actually<00:04:13.160> get<00:04:13.460> to<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.670> desktop<00:04:14.030> but<00:04:14.500> I'd<00:04:15.500> say

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
actually get to the desktop but I'd say

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.979 
actually get to the desktop but I'd say
I'm<00:04:15.860> making<00:04:16.190> darn<00:04:16.489> good<00:04:16.700> time<00:04:19.870> check<00:04:20.870> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
I'm making darn good time check the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.890 
I'm making darn good time check the
clock<00:04:21.230> again<00:04:21.560> it's<00:04:21.769> 807<00:04:25.420> keep<00:04:26.420> in<00:04:26.540> mind<00:04:26.780> this

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
clock again it's 807 keep in mind this

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.310

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
initial benchmark and after this we

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.080 
initial benchmark and after this we

should be at the desktop and installing

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:49.430 
should be at the desktop and installing
the<00:05:37.270> final<00:05:37.630> updates<00:05:44.970> okay<00:05:45.970> I've<00:05:46.210> just<00:05:48.330> entered

out and get the initial updates on its

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.040 
out and get the initial updates on its

own like video card drivers and chipset

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.150 
own like video card drivers and chipset
drivers<00:06:05.440> and<00:06:05.620> things<00:06:05.770> like<00:06:05.920> that<00:06:11.100> wonder<00:06:12.100> if

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
drivers and things like that wonder if

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.520 
drivers and things like that wonder if
I'm<00:06:12.250> going<00:06:12.400> to<00:06:12.490> have<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.990> Aero<00:06:14.230> interface

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
I'm going to have the Aero interface

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.530 
I'm going to have the Aero interface
support<00:06:15.250> already<00:06:15.490> working<00:06:15.940> or<00:06:16.060> not<00:06:16.090> it'd

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
support already working or not it'd

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.910 
support already working or not it'd
probably<00:06:16.720> have<00:06:16.960> to<00:06:17.050> go<00:06:17.170> get<00:06:17.320> a<00:06:17.380> video<00:06:17.650> driver

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
probably have to go get a video driver

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.299 
probably have to go get a video driver
first

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:26.309 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:27.859 

it's<00:06:26.789> going<00:06:26.939> to<00:06:27.059> take<00:06:27.239> it<00:06:27.359> a<00:06:27.419> couple<00:06:27.629> minutes

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:27.869 
it's going to take it a couple minutes

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:31.699 
it's going to take it a couple minutes
here<00:06:28.759> so<00:06:29.759> I'll<00:06:29.939> pause<00:06:30.179> the<00:06:30.389> camera<00:06:30.779> again<00:06:30.899> it

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:31.709 
here so I'll pause the camera again it

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:39.349 
here so I'll pause the camera again it
is<00:06:31.889> now<00:06:32.119> 8:15<00:06:33.119> p.m.<00:06:38.029> okay<00:06:39.029> I<00:06:39.059> probably

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:39.359 
is now 8:15 p.m. okay I probably

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.059 
is now 8:15 p.m. okay I probably
shouldn't<00:06:39.659> have<00:06:39.809> even<00:06:39.929> positive<00:06:40.559> because<00:06:40.889> it

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
shouldn't have even positive because it

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.489 
shouldn't have even positive because it
came<00:06:41.219> right<00:06:41.429> up<00:06:41.459> to<00:06:41.579> the<00:06:41.759> desktop<00:06:42.239> as<00:06:43.199> soon<00:06:43.409> as

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:43.499 
came right up to the desktop as soon as

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:44.839 
came right up to the desktop as soon as
I<00:06:43.559> shot<00:06:43.739> the<00:06:43.889> camera<00:06:44.099> off<00:06:44.429> and<00:06:44.669> I<00:06:44.729> have

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.140 

there<00:07:03.230> we<00:07:03.320> go<00:07:03.530> I<00:07:03.860> have<00:07:04.100> since<00:07:04.460> installed<00:07:04.910> those

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
there we go I have since installed those

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.510 
there we go I have since installed those
a<00:07:05.420> couple<00:07:05.990> of<00:07:06.230> updates<00:07:06.410> and<00:07:06.830> rebooted<00:07:07.370> one

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
a couple of updates and rebooted one

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.980 
a couple of updates and rebooted one
more<00:07:07.730> time<00:07:08.030> and<00:07:08.930> it's<00:07:09.140> still<00:07:09.410> only<00:07:10.810> 819<00:07:11.810> p.m.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
more time and it's still only 819 p.m.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.970 
more time and it's still only 819 p.m.
so<00:07:14.990> it's<00:07:15.260> been<00:07:15.580> what<00:07:16.580> 23<00:07:17.180> minutes<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:18.140> I'm

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
so it's been what 23 minutes and I'm

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.770 
so it's been what 23 minutes and I'm
basically<00:07:19.430> done<00:07:19.760> with<00:07:19.940> the<00:07:20.030> installation<00:07:20.600> in

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
basically done with the installation in

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.120 
basically done with the installation in
fact<00:07:21.050> I<00:07:21.170> didn't<00:07:21.410> have<00:07:21.560> to<00:07:21.650> install<00:07:21.980> any

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.350 
fact I didn't have to install any
drivers<00:07:22.160> everything<00:07:23.000> just<00:07:23.120> worked<00:07:23.480> so<00:07:25.360> let's

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
drivers everything just worked so let's

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:36.330 
drivers everything just worked so let's
get<00:07:26.540> into<00:07:26.750> the<00:07:26.840> benchmark

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.400
