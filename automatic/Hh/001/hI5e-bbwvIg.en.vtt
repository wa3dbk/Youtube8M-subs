noticed is that most of whom rights I've

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.929 
noticed is that most of whom rights I've
been<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.109> in<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.769> United<00:04:05.099> States<00:04:05.189> of<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.760> bed

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
been on in the United States of the bed

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.720 
been on in the United States of the bed
a<00:04:06.599> little<00:04:06.930> color<00:04:07.650> into<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.010> water<00:04:08.249> to<00:04:08.489> make<00:04:08.609> it

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
a little color into the water to make it

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.179 
a little color into the water to make it
here<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.359> little<00:04:09.719> bit<00:04:09.870> bluer<00:04:10.230> here<00:04:10.889> they<00:04:11.010> don't

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
here a little bit bluer here they don't

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.039 
here a little bit bluer here they don't
seem<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.120> find<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.629> very

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
seem to do that I find that very

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.349 
seem to do that I find that very
refreshing<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:14.159> think<00:04:14.189> that's<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.700> smart<00:04:14.999> way<00:04:15.329> to

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
refreshing I think that's a smart way to

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.029 
refreshing I think that's a smart way to
do<00:04:15.599> things<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.849> it<00:04:17.849> was<00:04:18.209> fantastic<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.799> other

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
do things but it was fantastic the other

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.390 
do things but it was fantastic the other
thing<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.310> thought<00:04:20.519> was<00:04:20.699> interesting<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.479> that

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
thing I thought was interesting is that

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.249 
thing I thought was interesting is that
the<00:04:23.400> recommended<00:04:23.910> sitting<00:04:24.210> position<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.810> for

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
the recommended sitting position is for

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.360 
the recommended sitting position is for
the<00:04:25.410> children's<00:04:25.949> to<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.550> behind<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.449> adults

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the children's to be behind the adults

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.650 
the children's to be behind the adults
whereas<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.580> United<00:04:29.910> States<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.449> want

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
whereas in the United States you want

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.100 
whereas in the United States you want
the<00:04:30.960> lower<00:04:31.620> weighted<00:04:32.190> people<00:04:32.789> in<00:04:33.000> front<00:04:33.509> so<00:04:33.810> I
