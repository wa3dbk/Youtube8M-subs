00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 or the teknon out like this we're still here in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.940
 mobile world congress and good now 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.040
 we have a mobile each a samsung 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 galaxy s 5 to not fight too much 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.559
 We have money in hand, it seems to me that way 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.630
 is and well let's make a little 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 review camera analysis the truth 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 that very basic to show the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 functionalities to start me 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.100
 I think we have to remember a little 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 the specifications more than anything for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 re-highlight 16 megapixels of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 camera 13 had the 64 because in this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 case 16 a front camera of 2 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 megapixels perfect to make us 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 the autographed these transmit 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.079
 twitter and others and on the other hand comment 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 also that the rear camera 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.700
 comes with a very fast autofocus 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.230
 of 0.3 seconds as we said yesterday if 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 parents if you see a celebrity ahead 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.920
 with what you do already very quickly if 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 we have tested it and it works pretty 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 Well the truth is that it's a pleasure to be able to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.000
 take pictures quickly 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 otherwise it brings some news like 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 for example the flow house jon tan 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 commented on the iphone 5's is the one 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.680
 also even here but brings it in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 different formats and the truth 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.210
 which is good because at half speed 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 a quarter and an eighth of speed and the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.570
 We have really taken photos making a 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.810
 little more videos doing a bit the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.850
 useless and I think it looks very good 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.930
 reproduction is also very fluid 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.940
 also when we have seen it in the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.410
 gallery I think it's a good way 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.390
 that draws our attention, not if 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.460
 we want to record something punctual with a lot 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.170
 definition and slow is something that comes to us 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.030
 great if it's very good also brings 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 another way to innovate a bit here 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.010
 is fast bauza not that good all the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.960
 reverse in rapid motion yes but 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 good only for now is anecdotal 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 I will comment on the interface we have 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.550
 here in front I believe in an interface 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.670
 quite intuitive what happens that 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.320
 offers so many ways since sometimes we 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 we lose offer us endless 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.600
 options to configure the camera to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 the best situations you can take the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.740
 better photography and I think it's good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.009
 quite intuitive as I say but to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.080
 too many more times and it 's also 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.659
 brings an option that they have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.840
 Promoted in the presentation 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.540
 the selective press in this case what 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.180
 allows us 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.400
 to take a picture and then choose 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.290
 once we take it out where we want 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.920
 do the focus well on the part of the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.350
 front in the back and in all 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.150
 the Arab places really is fine 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.250
 it's a bit like the liter camera that 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.440
 he tells us he is so famous and good 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.300
 in this case and a trick that takes the picture 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.130
 in various formats and then you 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.260
 you simply say which one is going 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.460
 better we also have to talk about the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 front camera we have already said 2 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.490
 megapixels but good the truth is that 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.100
 for the photographs that we want 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.840
 perform basic with this wide angle 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.580
 that always integrate the cameras 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.830
 The truth is that they are pretty 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.230
 pretty good for me the wide- angle 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 is too broad the truth is that it 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 pretty note here we have our 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.650
 camera waving but good looks at 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.930
 this case does not look too good if 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.570
 it was beige and it's coming around it deforms a little 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.800
 the image is distorted but I think that 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.720
 roughly we have to highlight 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.530
 which is a camera that a camera 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.020
 pretty striking that works for us in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.550
 most situations and good I 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.130
 I think you can compete in quotes 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.400
 with the ceta 2 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.780
 one thing to highlight the hd works 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.550
 pretty well we've also tried it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.470
 in a very limited way here because 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.750
 it's very bright is this room is 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.160
 too undermined and too bright and 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.180
 it's good but as you can see in the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.370
 photography is noticeable it is noted a little 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.450
 correct operation in good effect 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.670
 I believe that this is all for the moment 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.760
 from this camera a first analysis a 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.930
 new first flirting I think it's 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.020
 a camera as we said enough 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.850
 complete and we'll see if you can compete to 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.080
 true science with that of the x2 but good 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.310
 I believe that stable we would be between 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.420
 quotes pretty happy with their 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.740
 performance so nothing more to say now 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.630
 if you liked the video dale I like 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.190
 Madame France subscribed to our channel 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 See you in the next video
