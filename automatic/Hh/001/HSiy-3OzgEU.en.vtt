00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.450 
phone very slow data wise the phone will
also<00:01:43.360> be<00:01:43.510> slow<00:01:43.750> because<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.380> 3g<00:01:44.830> not<00:01:45.130> 4g

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
also be slow because it is 3g not 4g

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.310
