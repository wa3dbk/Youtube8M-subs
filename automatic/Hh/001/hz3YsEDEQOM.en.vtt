you

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.480 

I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.520 

so<00:00:18.490> today<00:00:19.210> I'd<00:00:19.330> like<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.540> talk<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.320> you<00:00:20.410> about

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
so today I'd like to talk to you about

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.630 
so today I'd like to talk to you about
the<00:00:21.450> design<00:00:22.450> for<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.780> native<00:00:23.140> bee<00:00:23.350> hi<00:00:23.590> this<00:00:24.580> is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
the design for a native bee hi this is

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.380 
the design for a native bee hi this is
for<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.119> honey<00:00:25.300> hive<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:27.189> hive<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.610> in<00:00:27.790> three

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
for a honey hive the hive is in three

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.110 
for a honey hive the hive is in three
sections<00:00:29.790> bottom<00:00:30.790> section<00:00:33.330> middle<00:00:34.330> section

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sections bottom section middle section

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.770 
sections bottom section middle section
top<00:00:37.120> section<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.640> idea<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.540> three

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
top section the idea of the three

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.430 
top section the idea of the three
sections<00:00:41.020> is<00:00:41.890> that<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.430> can<00:00:42.699> both<00:00:43.440> propagate

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
sections is that you can both propagate

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.710 
sections is that you can both propagate
from<00:00:44.650> this<00:00:44.800> hive<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:45.580> split<00:00:46.059> it<00:00:46.210> into<00:00:46.420> two

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
from this hive so split it into two

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.139 
from this hive so split it into two
hives<00:00:46.989> when<00:00:47.350> it's<00:00:47.500> ready<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:47.950> also<00:00:48.820> collect

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
hives when it's ready and also collect

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.930 
hives when it's ready and also collect
honey<00:00:49.390> from<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.840> top<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:51.370> collect<00:00:51.670> honey<00:00:51.850> from

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
honey from the top we collect honey from

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.639 
honey from the top we collect honey from

are the young bees the larval bees and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.660 
are the young bees the larval bees and
you<00:01:14.800> need<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.550> divide<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.479> brood<00:01:16.750> into<00:01:17.140> two<00:01:17.670> in

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
you need to divide the brood into two in

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.090 
you need to divide the brood into two in
order<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.180> propagate<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.690> box<00:01:19.959> you've<00:01:20.830> got<00:01:21.009> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
order to propagate a box you've got to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.150 
order to propagate a box you've got to
have<00:01:21.220> some<00:01:21.490> brood<00:01:21.789> in<00:01:22.030> each<00:01:22.420> half<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
have some brood in each half of the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.389 
have some brood in each half of the
split<00:01:24.459> that<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:24.789> do<00:01:25.649> this<00:01:26.649> design<00:01:27.039> allows

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
split that you do this design allows

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.040 
split that you do this design allows
that<00:01:28.679> as<00:01:29.679> we'll<00:01:29.979> see<00:01:30.190> later<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:32.020> we

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
that as we'll see later when we

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.680 
that as we'll see later when we
propagate<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.860> real<00:01:33.130> hive<00:01:33.429> will<00:01:34.119> separate<00:01:34.569> the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
propagate a real hive will separate the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.460 
propagate a real hive will separate the
bottom<00:01:34.959> box<00:01:35.140> from<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.190> mid<00:01:36.369> box<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:38.229> that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
bottom box from the mid box like that

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.180 
bottom box from the mid box like that
that's<00:01:39.039> basically<00:01:39.340> dividing<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.869> brood<00:01:41.229> into

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
that's basically dividing the brood into

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.669 
that's basically dividing the brood into
two<00:01:42.429> which<00:01:43.330> allows<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.020> propagate<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
two which allows you to propagate the

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.029 
two which allows you to propagate the
whole<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.080> going<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.289> talk<00:01:47.530> about<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.830> few

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
whole I'm just going to talk about a few

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.490 
whole I'm just going to talk about a few
features<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.819> this<00:01:49.119> box<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.349> you've<00:01:50.470> got

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
features of this box so that you've got

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.790 
features of this box so that you've got
a<00:01:50.649> better<00:01:50.940> understanding<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.590> we're

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
a better understanding of what we're

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.730 
a better understanding of what we're
seeing<00:01:54.039> when<00:01:54.280> we<00:01:54.459> do<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> real<00:01:54.910> hive<00:01:55.240> split

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.780 

the<00:02:00.670> bottom<00:02:01.000> box<00:02:01.180> contains<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> entry<00:02:02.440> hole

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the bottom box contains the entry hole

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.240 
the bottom box contains the entry hole
the<00:02:03.790> entry<00:02:04.060> holds<00:02:04.330> important<00:02:04.810> because<00:02:05.740> these

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
the entry holds important because these

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.870 
the entry holds important because these
bees<00:02:06.490> being<00:02:06.790> stingless<00:02:08.429> require<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
bees being stingless require the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.260 
bees being stingless require the
physical<00:02:10.980> structure<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.160> box<00:02:12.520> for<00:02:13.120> their

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
physical structure of the box for their

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.110 
physical structure of the box for their
defense<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:14.830> important<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.819> have<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
defense so it's important to have the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.010 
defense so it's important to have the
whole<00:02:16.360> of<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.739> right<00:02:17.950> diameter<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:19.540> too<00:02:19.780> big

whole of the right diameter not too big

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.080 
whole of the right diameter not too big
otherwise<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:21.010> can't<00:02:21.280> defend<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.760> properly

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
otherwise they can't defend it properly

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.260 
otherwise they can't defend it properly
not<00:02:22.780> too<00:02:22.989> small<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.370> congestion<00:02:25.030> at

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
not too small or you get congestion at

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.640 
not too small or you get congestion at

the hive entrance 13 millimeters is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.350 
the hive entrance 13 millimeters is
probably<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:30.180> good<00:02:31.180> compromise<00:02:33.150> one<00:02:34.150> thing

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
probably a good compromise one thing

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.820 
probably a good compromise one thing
you'll<00:02:34.510> notice<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> box<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.530> made<00:02:35.680> of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you'll notice is the box is made of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.580 
you'll notice is the box is made of
thick<00:02:36.100> timber<00:02:36.420> thicker<00:02:37.420> timber<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.470> is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
thick timber thicker timber then is

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.420 
thick timber thicker timber then is
normally<00:02:39.100> used<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.640> honeybee<00:02:40.330> hives<00:02:41.430> that's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
normally used for honeybee hives that's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.340 
normally used for honeybee hives that's
because<00:02:42.760> these<00:02:42.970> bees<00:02:43.269> don't<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.780> such<00:02:44.320> a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
because these bees don't have such a

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
because these bees don't have such a
great<00:02:44.860> ability<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:46.120> regulate<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
great ability to regulate the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.770 
great ability to regulate the
temperature<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.709> their<00:02:48.250> hive<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.820> honey<00:02:49.540> bees

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
temperature in their hive as honey bees

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.620 
temperature in their hive as honey bees
do<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.200> rely<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.280> thermal<00:02:55.209> property

that they seal that gaps helps them to

these<00:06:20.690> boxes<00:06:21.230> because<00:06:21.740> it<00:06:21.890> does<00:06:22.070> have<00:06:22.370> many

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
these boxes because it does have many

think<00:06:29.960> its<00:06:30.080> environmental<00:06:30.830> footprint<00:06:31.370> is

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
think its environmental footprint is

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.300 
think its environmental footprint is
quite<00:06:31.880> small<00:06:32.330> because<00:06:32.840> it<00:06:33.170> is<00:06:33.320> plantation

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310

grown in a sustainable way I believe a
disadvantage<00:06:39.020> of<00:06:39.170> pine<00:06:39.440> is<00:06:39.770> that<00:06:40.580> it's<00:06:40.730> not

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
disadvantage of pine is that it's not

disadvantage of pine is that it's not

one<00:06:48.230> way<00:06:48.440> of<00:06:49.300> compensating<00:06:50.300> that<00:06:51.310> obviously
