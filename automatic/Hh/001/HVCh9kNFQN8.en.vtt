00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
let's do a little bit of thought so

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.150 
let's do a little bit of thought so
heard<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.840> reason<00:02:52.140> her<00:02:52.290> being<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.769> the

i I don't I don't know what to think

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180 
i I don't I don't know what to think
aside<00:03:52.109> from<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.350> fact<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.799> really

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
aside from the fact that this really

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.190 
aside from the fact that this really
clarifies<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.700> fact<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.239> Peter<00:03:54.780> Parker's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
clarifies the fact that Peter Parker's

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620 
clarifies the fact that Peter Parker's
jumps<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.680> 50<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.190> means<00:03:56.519> he's<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.329> it

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
jumps you 50 so that means he's like it

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.069 
jumps you 50 so that means he's like it
may<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.079> freshman<00:03:58.829> so<00:03:59.250> he's<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.459> 15<00:03:59.940> 16<00:04:00.239> so

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
may be a freshman so he's like 15 16 so

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.660 
may be a freshman so he's like 15 16 so
10<00:04:01.319> years<00:04:01.500> from<00:04:01.620> now<00:04:01.709> inspiring<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.549> this

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
10 years from now inspiring and this

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750 
10 years from now inspiring and this
prime<00:04:03.030> she'd<00:04:03.660> be<00:04:03.810> like<00:04:03.959> 60<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.400> guess<00:04:05.730> that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
prime she'd be like 60 so I guess that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.940 
prime she'd be like 60 so I guess that
makes<00:04:06.030> sense<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.720> don't<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.230> man<00:04:07.620> she's
