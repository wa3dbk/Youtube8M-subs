00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.189 
tractor and we've been moving it about
once<00:00:14.400> or<00:00:14.580> twice<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.849> week<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.900> they're<00:00:16.049> really

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
once or twice a week but they're really

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
once or twice a week but they're really
outgrowing<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.820> were<00:00:17.940> having<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.270> move

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
it like every other day um so we thought

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.910 
it like every other day um so we thought
it<00:00:22.140> was<00:00:22.199> time<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> open<00:00:22.890> up<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> door<00:00:23.519> and

it was time to open up the door and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
it was time to open up the door and
hopefully<00:00:25.920> our<00:00:26.699> cat<00:00:27.000> will<00:00:27.420> decide<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.990> eat

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.729 
and we opened it up and they're really
liking<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.160> freedom<00:02:11.319> there's<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.440> water

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
liking the freedom there's a water

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.830 
liking the freedom there's a water
bucket<00:02:13.120> that's<00:02:14.120> pretty<00:02:14.360> cool<00:02:14.510> because<00:02:14.660> you

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
bucket that's pretty cool because you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.630 
bucket that's pretty cool because you
can<00:02:14.989> put<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> five<00:02:15.769> gallon<00:02:15.950> water<00:02:16.220> bucket

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
can put it's a five gallon water bucket

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.850 
can put it's a five gallon water bucket
so<00:02:16.849> we<00:02:17.239> only<00:02:17.420> have<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.840> fill<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.170> maybe<00:02:18.560> once

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so we only have to fill that maybe once

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.410 
so we only have to fill that maybe once
every<00:02:19.129> week<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:19.910> every<00:02:20.239> two<00:02:21.110> weeks<00:02:25.239> that's<00:02:26.239> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
every week or every two weeks that's a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.530 
every week or every two weeks that's a
little<00:02:27.010> visit<00:02:28.040> that's<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.370> holding<00:02:29.090> glish<00:02:29.269> game

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
little visit that's a holding glish game

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
little visit that's a holding glish game
looks<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.170> head<00:02:30.349> oh<00:02:32.200> yeah<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.319> also

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
looks like at the head oh yeah we also

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.250 
looks like at the head oh yeah we also
trying<00:02:33.799> another<00:02:34.129> variety<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.610> turkeys<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
trying another variety of turkeys and I

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.559 
trying another variety of turkeys and I
am<00:02:36.380> not<00:02:36.590> very<00:02:37.030> impressed<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.209> them<00:02:38.330> at<00:02:38.480> all

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
am not very impressed with them at all

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.440 
am not very impressed with them at all
it's<00:02:39.349> on<00:02:39.590> blue<00:02:39.890> slate<00:02:40.310> turkeys<00:02:40.849> I<00:02:41.030> don't<00:02:41.269> like

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it's on blue slate turkeys I don't like

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.930 
it's on blue slate turkeys I don't like
the<00:02:41.599> color<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.500> babies<00:02:42.829> because<00:02:43.760> they're

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the color of the babies because they're

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.660 
the color of the babies because they're
like<00:02:44.120> white<00:02:44.390> grey<00:02:44.780> they'd<00:02:45.079> be<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.530> big<00:02:46.250> target

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
like white grey they'd be a big target

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.490 
like white grey they'd be a big target
for<00:02:46.700> predators<00:02:47.269> because<00:02:47.420> they<00:02:47.599> don't<00:02:47.780> blend

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
for predators because they don't blend

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.059 
for predators because they don't blend
in<00:02:48.650> at<00:02:48.799> all<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.400> our<00:02:49.549> landscape<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:51.069> Texas

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
in at all to our landscape here in Texas

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.460 
in at all to our landscape here in Texas
and<00:02:52.329> also<00:02:53.329> they're<00:02:53.480> not<00:02:53.599> very<00:02:53.780> Hardy<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> think

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
and also they're not very Hardy I think

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.920 
and also they're not very Hardy I think
we've<00:02:54.590> lost<00:02:54.799> about<00:02:55.130> half<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.299> ones<00:02:56.510> that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
we've lost about half of the ones that

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.780 
we've lost about half of the ones that
that<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.019> bought<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:01.040> very<00:03:01.280> impressed<00:03:01.549> at<00:03:01.670> all

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
with them they'll probably all end up in

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.490 
with them they'll probably all end up in
the<00:03:03.230> freezer

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.789
