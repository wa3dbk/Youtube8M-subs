00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 It's people who go out to walk with us. 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.400
 best friend is always a very joy 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 big with party 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.290
 now if he walks along and does not stay 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.519
 pulling ag dragging people behind is 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.460
 even better 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.130
 but then our trainer on duty 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.869
 will show you how you can teach your 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.869
 dog walk your tightrope 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.359
 today we'll be talking then 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.359
 pulls too much on tab 1 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.710
 this solution that I'm going to give you 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 also serves as a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 example the dog when it wants to advance in a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 dog or what it is to play with 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 the dogs are you walking him? 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.800
 It pulls a lot then the first tip I 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 I think it 's very important 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 always walk with a shoe that he 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 safety slipper high heel and this can 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 give an accident when you are 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.110
 driving dog 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.560
 another detail is to position correctly 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.380
 the guide so that if you put your hand in the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.439
 chest the trend forward 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.270
 now if you put your hand on your chin it will 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.670
 a better posture and for the dog is the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 Same thing you leave down here. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.220
 the tendency is that he will pull over here 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.009
 above will give greater security 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.740
 a worldwide convention is that these dogs 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.710
 always walks on the left side the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.229
 dog is already positioned what the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.950
 people have to try to see what they like 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 to him 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 so we create an interest in it and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 We're going to start the important thing is when 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 you leave to walk with the dog always 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.369
 give voice command 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.960
 Let's go when you stop high for what? 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.960
 Make it easy, we 'll see it now. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 let's go 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:13.570
 google ad hoc and I do not even think it's good 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 the line is Latin and in detail 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.850
 important is this guide 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.830
 it is used for driving then when 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
 You 're giving a pet is not for 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 you pull hard 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.890
 It is simply to stop a 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.600
 in a way that is stretched but does not 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.959
 hurry not to hurt the dog you 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.310
 can also associate commands as already 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.270
 I said, 'Come on, you're walking the top. 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.740
 then sit down and continue personal now 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.450
 I will show the dog that is already 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.740
 doing this exercise for you to see 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.740
 a small difference 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 I think ok 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:05.350
 the line is high without a good boy 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.390
 very well very good the staff there he 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.220
 already knows how to do the exercise correctly 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.350
 to walk together but even so it is 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.989
 important to reward him so that he 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.489
 understand that always an exercise 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.590
 extremely nice for the dog 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.250
 I'm sure if you are 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.750
 practicing your dog will also 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 do this exercise the way 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.489
 nice and correct 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.489
 Many thanks, let's go. 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.269
 It's from Latin and I read I think I'm going to invade
