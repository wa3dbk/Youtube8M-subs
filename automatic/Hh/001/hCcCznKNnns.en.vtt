00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.000
 lint type cookies 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.400
 Jubilee need to break 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 and then knead with a crush to the state 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.059
 large crumbs 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 if they come across significant 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.189
 hazelnut sized pieces 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 you can leave nuts too 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.930
 blender in pulsing mode to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.800
 cocoa and you don't and add condensed milk and

 melted butter with a spoon 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.159
 knead it will not work so I will 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.159
 stir up 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.759
 I divide the resulting mass into 4 parts 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.700
 form sausages and remove them 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.330
 freezing sausages may be different 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.509
 thickness 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.180
 You can also wrap them in a film. 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.490
 and in food foil then there will be more 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.970
 more like real sausage 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.799
 for this process as you see i 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.590
 I use silicone sheet 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.850
 designed for rolling dough to him 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.909
 nothing sticks 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.220
 it is easy to clean and the table remains clean 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.049
 before serving chocolate sausage can 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.569
 cut into slices as it should be 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.239
 sausage and since we have a dish 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.069

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.110

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.440
