the<00:01:08.909> only<00:01:09.180> downside<00:01:09.600> i<00:01:09.870> find<00:01:10.230> to<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.620> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the only downside i find to this is that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.010 
the only downside i find to this is that
it<00:01:10.920> comes<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.460> five<00:01:11.760> parts<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.930> to

it comes in five parts so you have to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
it comes in five parts so you have to
download<00:01:13.200> each<00:01:13.500> individual<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.430> each<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
download each individual one and each of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
download each individual one and each of
them<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:14.970> adfly<00:01:15.570> links<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.860> here

MP then minecraft forge if you upload it
in<00:02:42.500> any<00:02:42.650> other<00:02:42.739> order<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:45.260> there's

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
in any other order the like there's

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.380 
in any other order the like there's
files<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.430> are<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.640> same<00:02:46.819> in<00:02:46.879> there<00:02:47.150> that'll

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
files that are the same in there that'll

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.569 
files that are the same in there that'll
overwrite<00:02:47.870> each<00:02:47.989> other<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.920> why<00:02:49.099> you<00:02:49.489> have

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
overwrite each other that's why you have

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.100 
overwrite each other that's why you have
to<00:02:49.700> install<00:02:49.819> modloader<00:02:50.239> first<00:02:50.780> then

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
to install modloader first then

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.619 
to install modloader first then
modloader<00:02:51.519> MP<00:02:52.519> over<00:02:52.790> top<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.180> because<00:02:53.480> you

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
modloader MP over top of it because you

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.660 
modloader MP over top of it because you
want<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.959> MP<00:02:54.379> files<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.980> overwrite<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
want the MP files to overwrite the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.479 
want the MP files to overwrite the
modloader<00:02:55.970> files<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.510> then<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.739> forage<00:02:58.220> over

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
modloader files and then the forage over

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.369 
modloader files and then the forage over
top<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.670> MP<00:02:59.260> so<00:03:00.260> it'll<00:03:00.680> override<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.160> MP<00:03:01.370> files

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
top of MP so it'll override the MP files

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.039 
top of MP so it'll override the MP files
so<00:03:03.379> first<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.739> all<00:03:03.799> let's<00:03:04.099> put<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.430> modloader
