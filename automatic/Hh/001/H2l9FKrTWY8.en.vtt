00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
around the ZIF socket lots of room

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
around the ZIF socket lots of room
around<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:43.439> good<00:01:43.619> solid<00:01:44.159> capacitors

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
around there got good solid capacitors

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.060 
around there got good solid capacitors
on<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.270> low<00:01:45.840> capacity<00:01:46.439> low<00:01:46.590> profiles

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
on here all low capacity low profiles

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
on here all low capacity low profiles
and<00:01:47.310> hit<00:01:47.460> anything<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.229> head<00:01:49.229> over<00:01:49.320> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and hit anything on then head over here

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.770
