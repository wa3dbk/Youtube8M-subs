hi<00:00:01.510> guys<00:00:01.720> in<00:00:02.260> the<00:00:02.560> past<00:00:02.949> I'd<00:00:03.279> created<00:00:03.790> a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:03.909 
hi guys in the past I'd created a

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.160 
hi guys in the past I'd created a
tutorial<00:00:04.120> on<00:00:04.779> how<00:00:05.080> to<00:00:05.110> make<00:00:06.660> rounded<00:00:07.660> corners

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
tutorial on how to make rounded corners

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.000 
tutorial on how to make rounded corners
for<00:00:08.440> sharp<00:00:09.340> edges<00:00:09.580> on<00:00:09.790> your<00:00:10.240> model<00:00:10.890> then<00:00:11.890> they

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
for sharp edges on your model then they

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.450 
for sharp edges on your model then they
used<00:00:12.220> the<00:00:12.780> default<00:00:13.780> cube<00:00:14.260> as<00:00:14.500> an<00:00:14.620> example<00:00:14.980> and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
used the default cube as an example and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.380 
used the default cube as an example and
I'd<00:00:16.029> used<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.679> sub<00:00:17.679> surface<00:00:18.310> to<00:00:18.699> fight<00:00:18.939> and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
I'd used the sub surface to fight and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.630 
I'd used the sub surface to fight and
loop<00:00:20.079> cut<00:00:20.349> and<00:00:20.529> slide<00:00:20.800> feature<00:00:21.159> for<00:00:21.489> this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
loop cut and slide feature for this

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.319 
loop cut and slide feature for this
which<00:00:21.939> was<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.150> bit<00:00:22.419> long-winded<00:00:22.839> and<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:25.060> very

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
which was a bit long-winded and not very

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.509 
which was a bit long-winded and not very
accurate<00:00:25.810> and<00:00:26.529> I<00:00:26.679> discovered<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.189> new<00:00:27.339> way<00:00:27.489> of

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
accurate and I discovered a new way of

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.790 
accurate and I discovered a new way of
doing<00:00:27.759> this<00:00:27.999> using<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:28.689> bevel<00:00:29.259> feature<00:00:29.499> on

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
doing this using the bevel feature on

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.310 
doing this using the bevel feature on
blender<00:00:30.599> depending<00:00:31.599> on<00:00:31.689> what<00:00:31.809> version<00:00:32.020> you're

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
blender depending on what version you're

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.890 
blender depending on what version you're
using<00:00:32.349> I'm<00:00:32.920> using<00:00:33.130> two<00:00:33.520> point<00:00:33.820> six<00:00:34.150> eight<00:00:34.480> I

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
using I'm using two point six eight I

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.530 
using I'm using two point six eight I
believe<00:00:35.200> two<00:00:35.650> point<00:00:35.950> six<00:00:36.190> seven<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:36.940> six<00:00:37.180> six

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
believe two point six seven and six six

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.500 
believe two point six seven and six six
have<00:00:37.750> it<00:00:37.930> but<00:00:38.200> anything<00:00:38.620> I'm<00:00:39.040> not<00:00:39.250> sure<00:00:39.510> which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
have it but anything I'm not sure which

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
have it but anything I'm not sure which
version<00:00:40.540> below<00:00:41.080> that<00:00:41.410> doesn't<00:00:41.830> happen<00:00:42.010> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
version below that doesn't happen and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.920 
version below that doesn't happen and
well<00:00:45.070> I'll<00:00:45.910> get<00:00:46.090> started<00:00:46.330> just<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.720> show<00:00:46.870> you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
well I'll get started just to show you

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.290 
well I'll get started just to show you
how<00:00:47.140> to<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.380> this<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.760> we're<00:00:48.970> using<00:00:49.120> the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
how to do this so we're using the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.740 
how to do this so we're using the
default<00:00:49.660> cube<00:00:49.960> again<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:52.090> always<00:00:52.329> and

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
default cube again and like always and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.590 
default cube again and like always and
blender<00:00:53.170> you<00:00:53.350> have<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.680> go<00:00:53.829> into<00:00:54.040> edit<00:00:54.250> mode<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
blender you have to go into edit mode to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800 
blender you have to go into edit mode to
do<00:00:55.690> your<00:00:55.840> modeling<00:00:57.329> you'll<00:00:58.329> see<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.660> the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
do your modeling you'll see that the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.569 
do your modeling you'll see that the
whole<00:00:58.840> cube<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.350> highlighted<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.130> all<00:01:00.370> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
whole cube is highlighted so all the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.200 
whole cube is highlighted so all the
corners<00:01:01.000> are<00:01:01.030> actually<00:01:01.450> selected<00:01:02.340> press<00:01:03.340> ctrl

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
corners are actually selected press ctrl

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.889 
corners are actually selected press ctrl
P<00:01:04.989> for<00:01:05.379> bevel<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.920> move<00:01:06.579> your<00:01:06.759> mouse<00:01:08.969> and<00:01:09.969> say

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
P for bevel and move your mouse and say

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.800 
P for bevel and move your mouse and say
I<00:01:10.929> want<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.319> to<00:01:11.679> about<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.069> point<00:01:12.810> before

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
I want it to about this point before

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.349 
I want it to about this point before
doing<00:01:14.229> anything<00:01:14.590> else<00:01:14.890> use<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:16.090> roller

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
doing anything else use the roller

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.889 
doing anything else use the roller
button<00:01:17.109> on<00:01:17.200> your<00:01:17.319> mouse<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.850> roll<00:01:19.509> it<00:01:19.630> forward

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
button on your mouse so roll it forward

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.029 
button on your mouse so roll it forward
and<00:01:20.999> you<00:01:21.999> can<00:01:22.179> see<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:23.350> edges<00:01:23.499> are<00:01:23.740> getting

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
and you can see the edges are getting

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.249 
and you can see the edges are getting
curved<00:01:24.639> and<00:01:24.880> when<00:01:25.689> you're<00:01:25.810> happy<00:01:25.990> with<00:01:26.109> that

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
curved and when you're happy with that

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.239 
curved and when you're happy with that
left<00:01:26.829> hand<00:01:26.979> click<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.369> mouse<00:01:27.490> button<00:01:27.850> and

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
left hand click the mouse button and

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.949 
left hand click the mouse button and
that's<00:01:30.249> it<00:01:30.520> that's<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.240> cube<00:01:31.509> with<00:01:31.659> rounded

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
that's it that's your cube with rounded

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.539 
that's it that's your cube with rounded
corners<00:01:32.350> much<00:01:32.829> quicker<00:01:33.100> more<00:01:34.090> efficient<00:01:34.569> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
corners much quicker more efficient and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.190 
corners much quicker more efficient and
actually<00:01:36.549> more<00:01:36.909> accurate<00:01:37.420> because<00:01:37.569> all<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
actually more accurate because all the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.830 
actually more accurate because all the
corners<00:01:38.649> are<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.909> same<00:01:40.889> equally<00:01:41.889> radiused<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
corners are the same equally radiused of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.449 
corners are the same equally radiused of
course<00:01:44.139> you're<00:01:44.289> not<00:01:44.380> limited<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.829> do<00:01:45.069> it<00:01:45.189> for

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
course you're not limited to do it for

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.580 
course you're not limited to do it for
all<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.909> corners<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.420> can<00:01:46.450> actually<00:01:46.990> select

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
all the corners you can actually select

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.120 
all the corners you can actually select
one<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.219> corners<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:49.569> example<00:01:50.049> son<00:01:50.950> like

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
one of the corners for example son like

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.929 
one of the corners for example son like
that<00:01:51.159> corner<00:01:51.819> there<00:01:52.499> control<00:01:53.499> B

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
that corner there control B

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.480 
that corner there control B
and<00:01:55.829> once<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:57.009> starts<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.819> move<00:01:58.270> like<00:01:58.869> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and once it starts to move like so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.639 
and once it starts to move like so
before<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.579> do<00:02:00.700> anything<00:02:00.909> use<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> roller<00:02:02.229> on

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
before you do anything use the roller on

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.910 
before you do anything use the roller on
your<00:02:02.979> mouse<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.640> roll<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.619> we've

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
your mouse and roll it and then we've

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.210 
your mouse and roll it and then we've
got<00:02:06.100> one<00:02:06.640> corner<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.659> has<00:02:08.560> been<00:02:08.860> radiused

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
got one corner that has been radiused

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.430 
got one corner that has been radiused
hope<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.360> comes<00:02:10.569> in<00:02:10.720> handy<00:02:10.869> thanks<00:02:11.319> very
