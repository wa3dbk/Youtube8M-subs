00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you my go-to everyday outfit when I have

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.829 
you my go-to everyday outfit when I have
no<00:00:14.370> idea<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.030> wear<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:15.809> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
no idea what to wear this is what I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.290 
no idea what to wear this is what I
gravitate<00:00:16.379> towards<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:18.150> is

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
gravitate towards so this first look is

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.120 
gravitate towards so this first look is
probably<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> most<00:00:18.990> dressy<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.710> them<00:00:19.890> all

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
probably the most dressy of them all

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.189 
probably the most dressy of them all
simply<00:00:20.609> because<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.449> shape<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
simply because of the shape of the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.560 
simply because of the shape of the
a-line<00:00:22.680> mini<00:00:22.949> skirt<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
a-line mini skirt but I think that you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
a-line mini skirt but I think that you
can<00:00:24.689> keep<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.439> casual<00:00:25.769> by<00:00:25.980> tying<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
can keep it really casual by tying a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
can keep it really casual by tying a
shirt<00:00:27.029> around<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> waist<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.349> course

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
shirt around the waist and of course

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.470 
shirt around the waist and of course
timming<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.550> comfy<00:00:30.000> sneakers

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
timming it with some comfy sneakers

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.350 
timming it with some comfy sneakers
these<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.740> Roche<00:00:32.250> runs<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.790> definitely

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

my<00:00:33.540> go-to<00:00:33.750> recently<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.250> pleased<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.700> got

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
my go-to recently I'm so pleased I got

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100 
my go-to recently I'm so pleased I got
the<00:00:35.969> gray<00:00:36.149> because<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> they're

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the gray because I think that they're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
the gray because I think that they're
very<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:38.190> versatile<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.300> color<00:00:44.239> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
very very versatile in this color so

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
very very versatile in this color so
often<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> wear<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
often when I don't know what to wear I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.060 
often when I don't know what to wear I
opted<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.149> really<00:00:48.480> basic<00:00:48.960> outfit<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
opted for just a really basic outfit and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.459 
opted for just a really basic outfit and
then<00:00:50.219> choose<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.820> statement<00:00:51.270> piece<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.230> just

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then choose one statement piece to just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
then choose one statement piece to just
jazz<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> output<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.789> bit<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.149> in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
jazz up the output a little bit more in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
jazz up the output a little bit more in
this<00:00:54.870> case<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> went<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.129> bright<00:00:56.520> colored

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

which<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.670> bit

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
which is something a little bit

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
which is something a little bit
different<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.330> me<00:01:12.479> usually<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.320> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
different for me usually I would just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.679 
different for me usually I would just
team<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> look<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.400> black<00:01:14.490> sneakers<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
team this look with black sneakers but

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
team this look with black sneakers but
since<00:01:15.960> I'd<00:01:16.080> already<00:01:16.110> done<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> snake<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
since I'd already done a snake a look I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.760 
since I'd already done a snake a look I
thought<00:01:17.520> I'd<00:01:17.790> show<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.000> guys<00:01:18.240> another<00:01:18.750> option

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
thought I'd show you guys another option

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.350 
thought I'd show you guys another option
so<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.830> may<00:01:22.130> have<00:01:22.160> noticed<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.730> so<00:01:23.120> far

so you may have noticed that so far

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.750 
so you may have noticed that so far
every<00:01:23.780> outfit<00:01:24.140> has<00:01:24.380> featured<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.010> t-shirt<00:01:25.460> I

every outfit has featured a t-shirt I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.610 
every outfit has featured a t-shirt I
think<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.720> perfect<00:01:27.110> option

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620
