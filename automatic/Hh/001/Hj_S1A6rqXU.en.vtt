my<00:00:17.289> name<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.650> Julian<00:00:18.039> Evans<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.450> own<00:00:19.660> small

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
my name is Julian Evans and I own small

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.050 
my name is Julian Evans and I own small
woodland<00:00:20.439> in<00:00:20.560> Hampshire<00:00:21.010> and<00:00:21.580> one<00:00:21.850> of<00:00:21.970> the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
woodland in Hampshire and one of the

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.190 
woodland in Hampshire and one of the
things<00:00:22.270> we've<00:00:22.480> needed<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.840> do<00:00:22.990> in<00:00:23.080> that

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
things we've needed to do in that

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260 
things we've needed to do in that
woodland<00:00:23.590> is<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.950> thin<00:00:24.279> out<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.939> trees

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
woodland is to thin out the trees

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.200 
woodland is to thin out the trees
because<00:00:26.110> as<00:00:26.500> trees<00:00:26.860> grow<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.759> can't<00:00:28.000> just

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
because as trees grow we can't just

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.820 
because as trees grow we can't just
leave<00:00:28.419> them<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.779> grow<00:00:28.960> thicker<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.560> thicker

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
leave them to grow thicker and thicker

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.589 
leave them to grow thicker and thicker
and<00:00:30.099> this<00:00:30.669> woodland<00:00:31.060> that<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.270> can<00:00:31.419> see

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
and this woodland that you can see

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.700 
and this woodland that you can see
behind<00:00:31.750> me<00:00:32.140> here<00:00:33.000> has<00:00:34.000> many<00:00:34.840> trees<00:00:35.199> that<00:00:35.230> need

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
behind me here has many trees that need

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.040 
behind me here has many trees that need
to<00:00:35.890> be<00:00:35.920> thinned<00:00:36.280> out<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.820> really<00:00:37.629> we<00:00:37.750> want<00:00:37.930> to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
to be thinned out and really we want to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.280 
to be thinned out and really we want to
do<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.440> for<00:00:38.650> two<00:00:38.680> reasons<00:00:39.489> one<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.900> favour

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
do that for two reasons one is to favour

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.979 
do that for two reasons one is to favour
the<00:00:42.100> best<00:00:42.400> tree<00:00:42.730> so<00:00:43.059> that<00:00:43.090> they<00:00:43.330> can<00:00:43.540> grow<00:00:43.780> on

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
the best tree so that they can grow on

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.380 
the best tree so that they can grow on
and<00:00:44.140> grow<00:00:44.290> well<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:45.280> other<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.699> is<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:46.089> to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and grow well the other is is is to

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.660 
and grow well the other is is is to
introduce<00:00:46.629> more<00:00:47.080> light<00:00:47.410> beneath<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.489> canopy

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
introduce more light beneath the canopy

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.060 
introduce more light beneath the canopy
onto<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.390> ground<00:00:49.660> floor<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.829> we<00:00:50.920> can

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
onto the ground floor so that we can

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.310 
onto the ground floor so that we can
have<00:00:51.190> more<00:00:51.340> bluebells<00:00:51.850> &amp;<00:00:52.149> primroses<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:52.960> all

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
have more bluebells &amp; primroses and all

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.069 
have more bluebells &amp; primroses and all
the<00:00:53.469> lovely<00:00:53.890> spring<00:00:54.489> flowers<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.420> we<00:00:55.840> like

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
the lovely spring flowers that we like

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.670 
the lovely spring flowers that we like
to<00:00:56.289> see<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.789> how<00:00:58.090> do<00:00:58.149> we<00:00:58.329> identify<00:00:59.230> which

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
to see but how do we identify which

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.819 
to see but how do we identify which
trees<00:01:00.070> should<00:01:00.309> come<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:00.820> how<00:01:01.480> many<00:01:01.840> well<00:01:02.800> I

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
trees should come and how many well I

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.340 
trees should come and how many well I
can<00:01:03.190> introduce<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.789> rule<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.119> thumb<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:05.050> first

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
can introduce a rule of thumb the first

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.249 
can introduce a rule of thumb the first
is<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:05.830> usually<00:01:06.640> when<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.660> do<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.899> thinning

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
is that usually when you do a thinning

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.340 
is that usually when you do a thinning
you<00:01:08.740> take<00:01:09.009> out<00:01:09.220> about<00:01:09.430> one<00:01:09.910> tree<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.600> every

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
you take out about one tree in every

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.650 
you take out about one tree in every
three<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:12.430> don't<00:01:12.550> need<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.850> be<00:01:12.970> mathematical

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
three you don't need to be mathematical

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.990 
three you don't need to be mathematical
about<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.170> every<00:01:14.710> third<00:01:14.979> tree<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.550> row<00:01:15.759> or

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
about this every third tree up a row or

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.570 
about this every third tree up a row or
anything<00:01:16.450> like<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:16.780> but<00:01:17.410> roughly<00:01:17.890> have<00:01:18.430> in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
anything like that but roughly have in

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.779 
anything like that but roughly have in
mind<00:01:18.850> one<00:01:19.240> tree<00:01:19.600> in<00:01:19.840> three<00:01:20.259> now<00:01:20.890> I've<00:01:21.099> got<00:01:21.399> here

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
mind one tree in three now I've got here

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.870 
mind one tree in three now I've got here
a<00:01:21.970> traditional<00:01:22.840> Kentish<00:01:23.259> billhook<00:01:23.740> which<00:01:24.520> is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
a traditional Kentish billhook which is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.749 
a traditional Kentish billhook which is
just<00:01:25.360> what<00:01:25.539> we<00:01:25.750> can<00:01:25.929> use<00:01:26.319> to<00:01:26.619> mark<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.490> trees

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
just what we can use to mark the trees

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.999 
just what we can use to mark the trees
that<00:01:28.360> ought<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.720> come<00:01:28.899> out<00:01:28.929> from<00:01:29.560> just<00:01:29.800> this

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
that ought to come out from just this

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.199 
that ought to come out from just this
area<00:01:30.459> where<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.240> are<00:01:31.360> standing<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.670> tradition

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
area where we are standing the tradition

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.100 
area where we are standing the tradition
is<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.750> put<00:01:37.959> a<00:01:37.990> blaze<00:01:39.300> on<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.630> tree<00:01:40.899> on

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
is that you put a blaze on the tree on

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.859 
is that you put a blaze on the tree on
both<00:01:41.800> sides<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.190> can<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:45.520> seen

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
both sides so that that can be seen

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.589 
both sides so that that can be seen
easily<00:01:46.869> by<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.739> tree<00:01:48.220> seller<00:01:48.610> operating<00:01:49.479> with

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
easily by the tree seller operating with

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.900 
easily by the tree seller operating with
his<00:01:49.720> chainsaw<00:01:50.020> coming<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.220> cut<00:01:51.429> them<00:01:51.610> through

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
his chainsaw coming to cut them through

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.020 
his chainsaw coming to cut them through
so<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.360> tree<00:01:52.989> is<00:01:53.229> now<00:01:53.500> destined<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.880> be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
so that tree is now destined to be

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.350 
so that tree is now destined to be
felled<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.599> removed<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.979> old<00:01:57.130> days<00:01:57.459> when

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
felled and removed in the old days when

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.719 
felled and removed in the old days when
this<00:01:58.569> was<00:01:58.780> done<00:01:59.020> with<00:01:59.470> an<00:01:59.590> axe<00:01:59.860> there<00:02:00.580> would

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
this was done with an axe there would

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.419 
this was done with an axe there would
often<00:02:01.179> be<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.360> crown<00:02:01.959> on<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.800> back<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.280> axe

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
often be a crown on the back of the axe

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.469 
often be a crown on the back of the axe
and<00:02:03.849> if<00:02:04.599> this<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:07.000> State<00:02:07.209> Forest

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
and if this was the the State Forest

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.910 
and if this was the the State Forest
Service<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.869> Forestry<00:02:08.289> Commission<00:02:08.500> they

Service the Forestry Commission they

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.859 
Service the Forestry Commission they
would<00:02:09.069> then<00:02:09.220> make<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.489> mark<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.270> show<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.690> yes

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
would then make a mark to show that yes

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.380 
would then make a mark to show that yes
that<00:02:11.349> was<00:02:11.530> an<00:02:11.650> official<00:02:11.950> tree<00:02:12.400> because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
that was an official tree because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
that was an official tree because
otherwise<00:02:13.780> somebody<00:02:14.290> else<00:02:14.470> could<00:02:14.650> come<00:02:14.800> along

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
otherwise somebody else could come along

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.550 
otherwise somebody else could come along
and<00:02:15.069> put<00:02:15.340> their<00:02:15.489> blazes<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.180> on<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:17.020> any<00:02:17.200> trees

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and put their blazes in on on any trees

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.380 
and put their blazes in on on any trees
that<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.099> owner<00:02:18.370> didn't<00:02:19.090> want<00:02:19.270> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that you as the owner didn't want to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
that you as the owner didn't want to
have<00:02:19.569> cut<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.349> that's<00:02:20.500> one<00:02:20.830> tree<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:21.280> leaning

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
have cut so that's one tree it's leaning

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
have cut so that's one tree it's leaning
it's<00:02:22.239> contributing<00:02:22.720> nothing<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.560> has<00:02:23.680> no

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it's contributing nothing it has no

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.059 
it's contributing nothing it has no
future<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.820> it's<00:02:24.970> best<00:02:25.240> cut<00:02:25.780> down<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.320> remove

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
future so it's best cut down and remove

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.750 
future so it's best cut down and remove
but<00:02:27.849> if<00:02:27.969> we<00:02:28.180> now<00:02:28.390> look<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.739> left<00:02:29.980> hand<00:02:30.459> side

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
but if we now look to my left hand side

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.330 
but if we now look to my left hand side
we<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.930> there's<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:32.590> other<00:02:32.769> dead<00:02:33.069> tree

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
we can see there's one other dead tree

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.839 
we can see there's one other dead tree
then<00:02:33.969> there's<00:02:34.389> a<00:02:34.659> tall<00:02:35.079> spruce<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:36.579> rather

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
then there's a tall spruce and a rather

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.229 
then there's a tall spruce and a rather
elegant<00:02:37.450> oak<00:02:38.319> tree<00:02:38.829> which<00:02:39.730> will<00:02:40.030> make<00:02:40.209> a

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
elegant oak tree which will make a

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.649 
elegant oak tree which will make a
really<00:02:41.079> good<00:02:41.349> final<00:02:42.219> crop<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> straight

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
really good final crop it is a straight

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.410 
really good final crop it is a straight
tree<00:02:44.019> but<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.950> one<00:02:45.129> thing<00:02:45.430> wrong<00:02:45.730> with<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.060> is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
tree but the one thing wrong with it is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.309 
tree but the one thing wrong with it is
that<00:02:46.480> its<00:02:47.019> crown<00:02:47.469> is<00:02:47.969> restricted<00:02:48.969> and<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.049> what

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
that its crown is restricted and so what

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.190 
that its crown is restricted and so what
we<00:02:50.530> want<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:50.859> do<00:02:51.159> is<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:52.090> remove<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:52.870> or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
we want to do is to remove one or

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.099 
we want to do is to remove one or
possibly<00:02:53.769> both<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.669> the<00:02:55.269> neighboring<00:02:55.450> trees

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
possibly both of the neighboring trees

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.339 
possibly both of the neighboring trees
either<00:02:56.859> side<00:02:58.169> now<00:02:59.169> as<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:01.599> owner<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:02.049> this

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
either side now as the owner of this

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.149 
either side now as the owner of this
wood<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.889> think<00:03:03.760> what<00:03:03.909> I<00:03:03.939> will<00:03:04.120> do<00:03:04.659> is<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.650> mark

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
wood I think what I will do is to mark

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.390 
wood I think what I will do is to mark
the<00:03:06.359> hornbeam<00:03:07.409> which<00:03:08.409> is<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> good<00:03:08.949> wood<00:03:09.129> for

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
the hornbeam which is a good wood for

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.610 
the hornbeam which is a good wood for
firewood<00:03:09.699> but<00:03:10.449> this<00:03:10.629> wood<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.019> full<00:03:11.379> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
firewood but this wood is full of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.009 
firewood but this wood is full of
hornbeam<00:03:12.400> copies<00:03:12.939> so<00:03:13.449> we<00:03:13.569> will<00:03:13.719> take<00:03:13.989> that

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
hornbeam copies so we will take that

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.289 
hornbeam copies so we will take that
tree<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.769> will<00:03:15.250> help<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.639> oak<00:03:15.819> to

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
tree and that will help the oak to

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.500 
tree and that will help the oak to
develop<00:03:16.750> its<00:03:16.900> branches<00:03:17.639> over<00:03:18.639> towards<00:03:19.329> these

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
develop its branches over towards these

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.170 
develop its branches over towards these
other<00:03:19.780> conifers<00:03:20.439> so<00:03:21.010> we'll<00:03:21.219> go<00:03:21.430> over<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.969> will

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
other conifers so we'll go over and will

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.199 
other conifers so we'll go over and will
now<00:03:22.389> do<00:03:22.449> a<00:03:22.659> mark<00:03:23.019> on<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.980> hornbeam<00:03:24.489> tree<00:03:24.790> we

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
now do a mark on the hornbeam tree we

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:34.589 
now do a mark on the hornbeam tree we
will<00:03:25.359> put<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.599> glaze<00:03:26.139> on<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:34.359> is

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
will put that glaze on it and that is

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.710 
will put that glaze on it and that is
all<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.439> is<00:03:35.699> sufficient<00:03:36.699> to<00:03:36.879> mark<00:03:37.449> your

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
all that is sufficient to mark your

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.319 
all that is sufficient to mark your
trees<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.949> the<00:03:39.129> first<00:03:39.370> tree<00:03:39.639> we<00:03:39.849> marked<00:03:40.180> was

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
trees so the first tree we marked was

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.699 
trees so the first tree we marked was
one<00:03:40.509> that<00:03:40.629> was<00:03:40.720> dead<00:03:40.989> or<00:03:41.199> perhaps<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.620> might

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
one that was dead or perhaps it might

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.710 
one that was dead or perhaps it might
have<00:03:41.859> been<00:03:41.949> a<00:03:42.040> diseased<00:03:42.489> tree<00:03:42.970> which<00:03:43.389> is<00:03:43.540> good

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
have been a diseased tree which is good

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.140 
have been a diseased tree which is good
to<00:03:43.840> take<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.709> second<00:03:45.129> tree<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.549> have<00:03:45.729> marked

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
to take the second tree we have marked

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.110 
to take the second tree we have marked
is<00:03:46.299> one<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.139> is<00:03:47.259> interfering<00:03:48.250> with<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.699> really

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
is one that is interfering with a really

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.479 
is one that is interfering with a really
important<00:03:49.750> tree<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.439> we<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.949> grow<00:03:51.250> on

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
important tree that we want to grow on

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.550 
important tree that we want to grow on
because<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.299> want<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.509> grow<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:53.169> good<00:03:53.349> Oak

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
because we want to grow really good Oak

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.189 
because we want to grow really good Oak
timber<00:03:53.979> and<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.180> tree<00:03:55.419> that's<00:03:55.930> just

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
timber and that is the tree that's just

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.219 
timber and that is the tree that's just
next<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.739> in<00:03:57.209> five<00:03:58.209> or<00:03:58.389> six<00:03:58.419> years<00:03:58.840> time

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
next to it in five or six years time

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.589 
next to it in five or six years time
when<00:04:00.189> this<00:04:00.430> operation<00:04:00.909> ought<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.389> be<00:04:01.479> done

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
when this operation ought to be done

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.559 
when this operation ought to be done
again<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.229> next<00:04:02.439> thinning<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.159> due

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
again and the next thinning is due

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.539 
again and the next thinning is due
probably<00:04:04.569> we<00:04:04.989> would<00:04:05.199> take<00:04:05.439> the<00:04:05.859> spruce<00:04:06.220> tree

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
probably we would take the spruce tree

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.879 
probably we would take the spruce tree
on<00:04:06.729> the<00:04:07.180> other<00:04:07.209> side<00:04:07.629> of<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.930> oak<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.590> give<00:04:08.769> it

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
on the other side of the oak to give it

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.990 
on the other side of the oak to give it
yet<00:04:09.129> more<00:04:09.669> space<00:04:11.219> when<00:04:12.219> you<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.519> marked<00:04:12.849> all

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
yet more space when you have marked all

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.030 
yet more space when you have marked all
of<00:04:13.150> those<00:04:13.329> trees<00:04:13.719> the<00:04:13.989> dead<00:04:14.229> the<00:04:14.530> dying<00:04:14.739> the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
of those trees the dead the dying the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.770 
of those trees the dead the dying the
diseased<00:04:15.370> trees<00:04:15.759> the<00:04:16.209> ones<00:04:16.449> that<00:04:16.659> are

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
diseased trees the ones that are

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.319 
diseased trees the ones that are
interfering<00:04:17.500> with<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> good<00:04:17.979> ones<00:04:18.219> you<00:04:18.579> might

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
interfering with the good ones you might

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.379 
interfering with the good ones you might
then<00:04:19.599> just<00:04:19.930> select<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.440> few<00:04:20.469> others<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.969> make<00:04:22.150> up

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
then just select a few others to make up

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.480 
then just select a few others to make up
to<00:04:22.930> your<00:04:23.169> rule<00:04:23.409> of<00:04:23.560> thumb<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.949> we<00:04:24.039> mentioned

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
to your rule of thumb that we mentioned

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.760 
to your rule of thumb that we mentioned
at<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.610> beginning<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.479> one<00:04:25.690> in<00:04:25.840> three<00:04:26.199> and<00:04:26.409> so

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
at the beginning the one in three and so
