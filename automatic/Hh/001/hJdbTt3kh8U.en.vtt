00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:17.420
 hello everyone today we'll talk about 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.060
 training systems which 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.529
 exist in the world 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.260
 no less in the world 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.140
 would say and start something first 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.040
 divide everything that exists into two 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.770
 large class interest schemes from 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.620
 let's call them tentatively 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.510
 intuitive than other days 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.750
 I think the percentage is clear when 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.820
 very good plan painted in 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.010
 percent that's your mind maximum with 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.239
 amount of lift intuitive 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.729
 suggest the selection of the weight of feelings on 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.949
 scheduled number of repetitions then 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.080
 there is an intuitive concept here too 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:08.920
 rather arbitrarily this is the first branch 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 second on foreign and domestic 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.930
 authors 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.450
 the author shall we say of the domestic one 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.990
 I would like to mention and what to say in 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.900
 First you should not overlook 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.820
 programs of our national team coaches 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.110
 though 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 real former interest here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.050
 attribute plans to Boris advances to intuitive 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.610
 the project called above constantin and on 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.310
 employee in the scheme everything is enough 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.119
 slender well-built effectively 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.950
 their showed confirmed 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.899
 athletes to prepare them performs on 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.300
 this day it is clear that 1 are 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.459
 second percentage 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.530
 In the second percent there is nothing what they are 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.510
 conclude can be found on the Internet 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.709
 google why about the rest as if not 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.400
 I speak because other programs 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.780
 they are training 1 2 3 5 7 and everything is here 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 are either offered 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.610
 certain base backbone building 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.190
 training cycle 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.799
 either already ready for specific training 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.630
 scheme to a different level of training then 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:46.350
 there is wider and more voluminous 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.209
 about foreign but here first of all 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.260
 First of all, again, I would like to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.799
 highlight simmons systems 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.350
 why because it is complete enough 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.440
 detailed by the author disclosed throughout 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.820
 many years of his writings speeches 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.350
 own and training his students 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:14.270
 she goes with reliance on 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:18.130
 interest schemes but especially ate 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.220
 again why am I speaking precisely in these 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.050
 let's say only about these things before 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.410
 simmons chic 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.440
 there are many other authors 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.460
 interesting and with workers training 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 By schemes I consider that in the modern elevator 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.600
 Well , how much can you call modern? 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.840
 the last 30 years how simax work 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:51.740
 in this area the inclusion of dynamic work 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.320
 Well, not that innovation but frankly 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.390
 saying only he gives so much 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.760
 value of dynamic days and work 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.150
 dynamically days go by 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.300
 squatting and on bench press ie 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.180
 it doesnâ€™t muscle reception there surprise it 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.490
 the basis of the system is precisely why 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.490
 simmons and again in a separate topic 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:24.300
 there is a lot more this is not a format 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.640
 a single video with a length of 5 minutes is just 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.310
 I wanted to talk about it because 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.010
 often asked for some programs 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.270
 training can be prepared 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.440
 he can only say one thing on 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.330
 trust professionals to people who 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.430
 bring up a champion bring up 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.370
 athletes then to a certain extent 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.650
 the result is guaranteed 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.280
 but again my current appeal is not 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.230
 treat those who ate the dog in this 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.370
 sports and naturally athlete high 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.540
 levels already know their 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.670
 restore failure 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.680
 individual characteristics and can 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.040
 make cycle training plans 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.510
 yourself on the basis of these 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.030
 features this first 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:20.480
 video for those who are just starting their 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:25.110
 way in sports and looking for a foothold 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.350
 I hope that happened to see thanks for 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.220
 attention patience that they heard to the end 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.220
 until we meet again
