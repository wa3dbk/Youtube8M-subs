00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.379
 we live in full psuv fashion where in 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.230
 all car segments 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.450
 there are versions of rural appearance 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 about me we have the fiat panda cross that 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.830
 is the car that we tested this week in 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.380
 today motor.com is about 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.560
 fiat panda 4x4 in one version yet 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.949
 more prepared for the off road this 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.660
 stroller is small but our bully 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.370
 Fixed cross band is equipped with the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.610
 only diesel engine available for the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 model the multijet of 80 horses 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.989
 with 5-speed manual transmission the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.989
 gasoline option would be the 0.9 twinair 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.659
 of two cylinders with 90 horses and box 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.790
 of 6 - speed manual transmission 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.489
 the aesthetic differences between a panda 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.010
 cross and a 4x4 panda are remarkable to 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.379
 first sight the cross stands out for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.059
 Offer more moldings 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.739
 protectors in black plastic that are 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.479
 those that give it that look so 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.850
 adventurous and that we like so much 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.799
 The bumpers that stand out 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.260
 They are introduced more into the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.780
 vehicle in the lower part which allows 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.920
 better angles concretely has 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 some angles of 20 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.049
 degrees in attack 21 in the ventral and 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.689
 34 in the output what are very figures 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.610
 good the ground clearance is 16 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.320
 centimeters and the suspension is 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.250
 slightly higher than in the fiat 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.049
 panda 4x4 finally we have a shot of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.270
 intake air placed in a 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.240
 highest position that will allow us 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.310
 vary rivers without fear of water entering 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 in the engine inside the fiat 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.299
 panda cross we also found some 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.640
 differentiating elements such as can be 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.950
 the specific upholstery or these moldings 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.920
 decorative in brown but most 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.080
 important is right here is the command 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.630
 attraction selector has three 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.220
 modes the first of them would be the mode 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.740
 automatic which will be selected 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.069
 default in this mode the vehicle 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.899
 sends 98% of the available pair to 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.060
 front wheels if a 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.549
 loss of traction or much demand 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.340
 acceleration also sends some torque 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:16.560
 according to the needs of the rear axle 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.230
 in the middle position we would have the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.920
 off road mode in this mode the most 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.290
 highlighted is the presence of the eleve that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.420
 It would be a lock system 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.459
 electronic differential simulated by the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 brakes and what that does then in the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.480
 time when one of the wheels 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.489
 car stays on the air brakes it so that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 that way the pair does not go for that 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.080
 wheel but go to the wheel that is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.959
 supported on the ground and therefore we 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.150
 allow to advance finally in the third 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.610
 position in combination with the mode 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.069
 off-road we have the control of descents 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.380
 that works up to a speed of 25 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.390
 kilometers per hour and what it does is 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.190
 apply the brakes so that the vehicle 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.060
 do not pack on the slopes 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.060
 descending 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.720
 circulate on all types of roads 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 is a problem for the little fiat 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.710
 panda cross its small size we 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.150
 allows to go through narrow sites or give 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.160
 the turn anywhere 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.960
 the suspension maintains a good degree of 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.760
 comfort and the address does not transmit 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.280
 many irregularities in areas 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.990
 bumpy 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.000
 the ground clearance is not a 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.370
 problem, but just in case we have a 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.290
 covers metallic poster if you have to 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.540
 circular space the first speed 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.340
 it has a very adequate development and except 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.260
 in the lowest area of ​​the lap counter the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.480
 80 horsepower diesel engine of this 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.480
 cross town is quite full 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.430
 the control of descents works goods 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.780
 industrial conditions on steep slopes can 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.550
 it's interesting to go down in neutral 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.230
 to prevent the car from being packed 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 too much so as not to collapse 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.849
 downloading large slopes does not represent 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.849
 a problem but upload them 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.220
 The truth is that if the difference is 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.139
 important will have to play hard 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.150
 gross revolutionize the engine in the 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.160
 boot to have more part and accelerate 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.590
 as we go up so as not to leave the 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.080
 motor falling of turns if the terrain is 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.970
 very rugged a high speed can 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.690
 be a problem since the car can 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.690
 start bouncing 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.419
 facing many obstacles 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.729
 Sometimes we will also be forced to 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.289
 give more to the short tours of the 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.479
 suspension can make us lose 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.930
 traction more easily if we go 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.930
 slowly 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.439
 until we arrive with the video test 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.419
 of the fiat panda cross a small 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.580
 city ​​utility that in turn can 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.619
 be a great off-road if you want 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.419
 know all the details I invite you to 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:13.229
 read the written test today
