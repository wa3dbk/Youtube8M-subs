00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
time and the purpose for this and this

has<00:02:26.790> happened<00:02:27.270> through<00:02:27.420> trial<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.780> error

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
has happened through trial and error

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.540 
has happened through trial and error
I've<00:02:28.200> used<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.740> than<00:02:28.920> two<00:02:29.040> beads<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> time

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
I've used more than two beads at a time

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.820 
I've used more than two beads at a time
only<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.209> beads<00:02:30.570> pop<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.140> when<00:02:31.680> you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
only to have my beads pop up when you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
only to have my beads pop up when you
lie<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.250> against<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.940> cuff<00:02:33.209> they<00:02:33.570> do<00:02:33.630> not

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
lie them against the cuff they do not

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.260 
lie them against the cuff they do not
lie<00:02:34.110> smooth<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.400> better<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.730> take<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
lie smooth so it's better to take the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.920 
lie smooth so it's better to take the
extra<00:02:36.750> time<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.790> two<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> time<00:02:39.480> hooby

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
extra time to just do two a time hooby

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.410 
extra time to just do two a time hooby
to<00:02:39.989> get<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> perfect<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.270> you're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
to get a perfect and and have if you're

brass in between the suede and the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.400 
brass in between the suede and the
beadwork<00:05:37.060> now<00:05:38.060> we<00:05:38.120> want<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.479> work<00:05:38.660> our<00:05:38.990> final

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.100 
stitch was it's a brick stitch and this
finishes<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:42.889> piece<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.460> closes<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.690> edges

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
finishes the piece and closes the edges

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.250

up<00:05:45.350> okay

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
up okay

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.510 
up okay
okay<00:05:46.680> now<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.670> started<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.720> few<00:05:48.960> rows<00:05:49.260> now<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.220> can

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
okay now I started a few rows now I can

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.550 
okay now I started a few rows now I can
see<00:05:50.730> why<00:05:50.880> you<00:05:50.940> left<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.360> little<00:05:51.750> bit<00:05:52.140> of<00:05:52.200> an<00:05:52.350> edge

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
see why you left a little bit of an edge

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.860 
see why you left a little bit of an edge
in<00:05:52.920> the<00:05:53.190> beginning<00:05:53.580> that's<00:05:53.850> why<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.180> like<00:05:54.660> that

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
in the beginning that's why I like that

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.430 
in the beginning that's why I like that
uh-huh

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
uh-huh

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.200 
uh-huh
and<00:05:55.620> when<00:05:55.950> you<00:05:56.130> are<00:05:56.160> cutting<00:05:56.850> in<00:05:57.090> the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
and when you are cutting in the

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.870 
and when you are cutting in the
beginning<00:05:57.920> it's<00:05:58.920> better<00:05:59.160> to<00:05:59.400> cut<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> little

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
beginning it's better to cut a little

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.660 
beginning it's better to cut a little
bit<00:06:00.030> more<00:06:00.390> because<00:06:01.140> some<00:06:01.590> Bader's<00:06:01.950> tend<00:06:02.340> to

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
bit more because some Bader's tend to

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.140 
bit more because some Bader's tend to
pull<00:06:03.120> a<00:06:03.450> little<00:06:03.630> bit<00:06:03.750> on<00:06:04.050> their<00:06:04.230> beading

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
pull a little bit on their beading

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.030 
pull a little bit on their beading
surface<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:06.360> can<00:06:06.750> make<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.560> inch<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.830> little

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
surface and can make the inch a little

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.560 
surface and can make the inch a little
bit<00:06:08.160> smaller<00:06:08.490> which<00:06:08.730> is<00:06:08.850> another<00:06:09.120> reason<00:06:09.330> they

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
bit smaller which is another reason they

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.030 
bit smaller which is another reason they
cannot<00:06:09.870> cut<00:06:10.200> off<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:12.710> quarter<00:06:13.710> of<00:06:13.830> an<00:06:13.920> inch

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
cannot cut off the quarter of an inch

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.160 
cannot cut off the quarter of an inch
too<00:06:14.400> soon<00:06:14.700> you<00:06:14.940> may<00:06:15.150> need<00:06:15.300> to<00:06:15.450> add<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.600> few<00:06:15.750> beads

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
too soon you may need to add a few beads

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.650 
too soon you may need to add a few beads
gotcha<00:06:16.830> okay<00:06:17.700> so<00:06:18.090> you're<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.360> really

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
gotcha okay so you're just really

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.050 
gotcha okay so you're just really
closing<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:19.290> up<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.620> really<00:06:19.890> keeping<00:06:20.820> them

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
closing it up and really keeping them

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.060 
closing it up and really keeping them
together<00:06:21.240> but<00:06:21.720> yeah<00:06:21.900> this<00:06:22.020> is<00:06:22.080> you<00:06:22.710> will<00:06:22.830> brick

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
together but yeah this is you will brick

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.070 
together but yeah this is you will brick
stitch<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.790> entire<00:06:24.240> way<00:06:24.600> around<00:06:24.630> the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
stitch the entire way around the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.020 
stitch the entire way around the
cabochon<00:06:25.650> brick<00:06:26.040> stitch<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.460> picking<00:06:26.820> up<00:06:26.910> a

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
cabochon brick stitch is picking up a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.830 
cabochon brick stitch is picking up a
single<00:06:27.210> bead<00:06:27.510> going<00:06:28.470> through<00:06:28.710> both<00:06:28.890> layers

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
single bead going through both layers

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.550 
single bead going through both layers
perfect<00:06:30.950> pulling<00:06:31.950> down<00:06:32.240> and<00:06:33.240> coming<00:06:33.630> up<00:06:33.750> and

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560
