00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
you can buy there's a lot of empty space
in<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.590> space<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> could<00:01:47.430> use

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in there that space that you could use

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.810 
in there that space that you could use
for<00:01:47.820> storing<00:01:48.119> energy<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:49.619> creating
