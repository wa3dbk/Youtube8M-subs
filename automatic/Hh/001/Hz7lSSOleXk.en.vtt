ordering my gaming PC hell I've ordered
it<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.160> was<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.340> its<00:00:11.519> way<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.360> should

it and it was on its way and it should

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.660 
it and it was on its way and it should
have<00:00:12.599> been<00:00:12.660> done<00:00:13.049> by<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:14.070> Fridays<00:00:14.519> ago

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
have been done by like two Fridays ago

but some issues occurred some some
setbacks<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.840> will

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
setbacks if you will

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
setbacks if you will
what<00:00:22.650> were<00:00:22.800> those<00:00:22.949> setbacks<00:00:23.460> well<00:00:23.760> my

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
what were those setbacks well my

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.740 
what were those setbacks well my
motherboard<00:00:24.800> was<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:26.580> bat<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> bad

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
motherboard was was bat I got a bad

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.519 
motherboard was was bat I got a bad
motherboard<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.960> coincidentally<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
motherboard and coincidentally the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
motherboard and coincidentally the
motherboard<00:00:32.390> probably<00:00:33.390> did<00:00:33.540> something<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
motherboard probably did something to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
motherboard probably did something to
the<00:00:34.020> processor<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.920> confirmed<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the processor I'm not confirmed on that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.569 
the processor I'm not confirmed on that
happening<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.860> reason<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
happening but for some reason the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
happening but for some reason the
processor<00:00:39.239> didn't<00:00:39.780> work<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.079> any<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> any

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
processor didn't work in any of any

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.979 
processor didn't work in any of any
motherboards<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.360> motherboard<00:00:42.570> itself

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
motherboards and the motherboard itself

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
motherboards and the motherboard itself
was<00:00:43.200> fried<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.670> sent<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> back<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> new

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
was fried and so I sent it back to new

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
was fried and so I sent it back to new
egg<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.129> what's

nerdy<00:00:59.039> guys<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.090> know<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.930> that's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
nerdy guys you know that that's that's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
nerdy guys you know that that's that's
most<00:01:01.559> definitely<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> faulty<00:01:02.370> motherboard<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
most definitely a faulty motherboard and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.750 
most definitely a faulty motherboard and
it<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:04.439> power<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.129> two<00:01:05.189> seconds

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it would power up for about two seconds

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
it would power up for about two seconds
and<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.000> shut<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.750> tried<00:01:06.960> everything

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and then shut off and I tried everything

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
and then shut off and I tried everything
from<00:01:07.530> making<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> power<00:01:08.939> connected

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
from making sure all the power connected

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
from making sure all the power connected
you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.260> 24<00:01:10.619> pin<00:01:10.799> connector<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you know the the 24 pin connector the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
you know the the 24 pin connector the
motherboard<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.729> plugged<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.090> nice<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
motherboard was plugged in nice and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
motherboard was plugged in nice and
secure<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.439> unplugged<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> plug<00:01:14.220> bag<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
secure I unplugged in the plug bag and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760 
secure I unplugged in the plug bag and
didn't<00:01:15.060> work<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.540> started<00:01:16.229> making<00:01:16.320> sure<00:01:16.560> what's

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
didn't work I started making sure what's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
didn't work I started making sure what's
the<00:01:16.860> power<00:01:17.009> supply<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> removed<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.119> parts

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the power supply so I removed some parts

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.880 
the power supply so I removed some parts
of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> PC<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> removed<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of the PC from you know I removed the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
of the PC from you know I removed the
graphics<00:01:20.250> card<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.000> graphics<00:01:21.299> cards

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
graphics card and the graphics cards

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.230 
graphics card and the graphics cards
gonna<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.049> 100<00:01:22.290> plus<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.820> its

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
gonna take about 100 plus what so if its

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
gonna take about 100 plus what so if its
power<00:01:24.509> supply<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.140> gonna<00:01:25.320> solve<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
power supply that's gonna solve that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.620 
power supply that's gonna solve that
issue<00:01:26.250> still<00:01:26.460> didn't<00:01:26.970> boo<00:01:27.090> ting<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> BIOS

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
issue still didn't boo ting the BIOS

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.620 
issue still didn't boo ting the BIOS
same<00:01:28.049> issue<00:01:28.939> basically<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> narrowed<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> down

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
same issue basically I narrowed it down

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
same issue basically I narrowed it down
to<00:01:30.990> either<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> motherboard<00:01:31.979> itself<00:01:32.220> or

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
to either be the motherboard itself or

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.990 
to either be the motherboard itself or
the<00:01:32.670> processor<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.579> honestly<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.939> know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the processor and honestly I don't know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
the processor and honestly I don't know
which<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> sent<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.900> both<00:01:37.140> back<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.009> new

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
which one so I sent in both back to new

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
which one so I sent in both back to new
egg<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.610> sent<00:01:38.909> both<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.270> Intel<00:01:39.600> Core<00:01:40.200> i7

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
egg I sent both my Intel Core i7

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410

something<00:03:08.910> along<00:03:09.090> those<00:03:09.300> lines<00:03:09.450> too<00:03:10.200> much

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
something along those lines too much

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.980 
something along those lines too much
then<00:03:10.770> hopefully<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:12.240> enough<00:03:12.600> money<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
then hopefully get enough money and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.200 
then hopefully get enough money and
raise<00:03:13.170> enough<00:03:13.440> money<00:03:13.470> via<00:03:13.830> doing<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:15.060> be

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
raise enough money via doing that to be

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.710 
raise enough money via doing that to be
able<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:16.680> replace<00:03:17.310> my<00:03:17.850> processor<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.630> my

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
able to to replace my processor and my

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.150 
able to to replace my processor and my
motherboard<00:03:18.990> if<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.770> replace<00:03:20.010> them

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
motherboard if I have to replace them

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.010 
motherboard if I have to replace them
I'm<00:03:20.340> hoping<00:03:20.670> new<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.180> gets<00:03:21.450> back<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.750> me<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.930> like

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
I'm hoping new I gets back to me is like

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.140 
I'm hoping new I gets back to me is like
yo<00:03:22.200> man<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.740> sent<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.070> bad<00:03:23.220> parts<00:03:23.580> here's<00:03:23.940> new

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
yo man we sent you bad parts here's new

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.570 
yo man we sent you bad parts here's new
parts<00:03:24.510> are<00:03:24.840> bad<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.500> most<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> time<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
parts are bad and most of the time I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.130 
parts are bad and most of the time I
think<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.970> they<00:03:27.090> will<00:03:27.270> do<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.780> most<00:03:28.110> of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
think that they will do that I most of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.810 
think that they will do that I most of
the<00:03:28.200> time<00:03:28.260> new<00:03:28.530> eggs<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:29.220> very<00:03:29.459> good<00:03:29.610> about

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
the time new eggs it's very good about

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.980 
the time new eggs it's very good about
that<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.300> we're<00:03:30.450> gonna<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.840> they're

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
that and so we're gonna see if they're

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.750 
that and so we're gonna see if they're
good<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.680> case<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.430> just<00:03:32.550> wanted

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
good in this case but I just wanted

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.490 
good in this case but I just wanted
update<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> guys<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:34.230> evident

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
update you guys on this the evident

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.020 
update you guys on this the evident
amount<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.740> gaming<00:03:34.980> PC<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.430> all<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.790> parts

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
amount of gaming PC is all the parts

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970 
amount of gaming PC is all the parts
work<00:03:36.180> I've<00:03:36.360> tested<00:03:36.810> most<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.500> parts<00:03:37.770> in<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
work I've tested most of the parts in a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.370 
work I've tested most of the parts in a
different<00:03:38.340> PC<00:03:38.700> actually<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.450> uh<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:40.200> means

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
different PC actually so uh that means

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.080 
different PC actually so uh that means
my<00:03:40.650> graphics<00:03:41.040> card<00:03:41.130> my<00:03:41.370> RAM<00:03:41.550> things<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.910> that

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
my graphics card my RAM things like that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.020 
my graphics card my RAM things like that
actually<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:42.989> work<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.550> that<00:03:44.790> my

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
actually do work it's just that my

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.120 
actually do work it's just that my
motherboard<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:47.000> processor<00:03:48.000> worked<00:03:49.130> working

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
motherboard and processor worked working

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.590 
motherboard and processor worked working
with<00:03:50.280> each<00:03:50.489> other<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.970> motherboard<00:03:51.420> was

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
with each other the motherboard was

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.590 
with each other the motherboard was
broken<00:03:52.020> which<00:03:52.200> thus<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.130> turn<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.489> think<00:03:53.600> made

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
broken which thus in turn I think made

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.090 
broken which thus in turn I think made
the<00:03:54.690> processor<00:03:55.290> have<00:03:55.500> some<00:03:55.680> issues<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.040> I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
the processor have some issues and I

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.380 
the processor have some issues and I
couldn't<00:03:56.520> be<00:03:56.610> completely<00:03:57.000> wrong<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.330> that

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
couldn't be completely wrong on that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.510 
couldn't be completely wrong on that
about<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.500> processor<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.130> I'm<00:03:59.220> gonna<00:03:59.340> say

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
about the processor so I'm gonna say

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.310 
about the processor so I'm gonna say
that<00:03:59.550> do<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.820> guys<00:03:59.970> think<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.690> guys<00:04:00.840> who<00:04:01.050> know

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
that do you guys think you guys who know

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.320 
that do you guys think you guys who know
more<00:04:01.620> than<00:04:01.770> about<00:04:02.160> pcs<00:04:02.670> than<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:02.940> do

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
more than about pcs than I do

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.970 
more than about pcs than I do
the<00:04:03.510> processor<00:04:03.989> might<00:04:04.140> be<00:04:04.290> fine<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> might<00:04:04.830> be

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
the processor might be fine it might be

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.180 
the processor might be fine it might be
completely<00:04:05.760> fine<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.720> that's<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.020> case

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
completely fine and if that's the case

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.080 
completely fine and if that's the case
awesome<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.340> hopefully<00:04:08.610> they'll<00:04:08.760> just<00:04:08.880> send

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
awesome and hopefully they'll just send

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.250 
awesome and hopefully they'll just send
me<00:04:09.209> back<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.450> one<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> had<00:04:10.050> previously

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
me back the one that I had previously

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.170 
me back the one that I had previously
and<00:04:10.830> if<00:04:11.220> they<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.489> because<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.000> working

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
and if they do that because it's working

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.580 
and if they do that because it's working
that's<00:04:12.480> completely<00:04:12.900> fine<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.290> don't<00:04:13.410> care

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
that's completely fine I don't care

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.500 
that's completely fine I don't care
about<00:04:13.770> that<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.550> do<00:04:14.670> know<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.030> motherboard

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
about that but I do know the motherboard

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.260 
about that but I do know the motherboard
did<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:16.020> an<00:04:16.109> issue<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.430> looked<00:04:18.000> through

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
did have an issue I I looked through

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.610 
did have an issue I I looked through
forums<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.840> things<00:04:18.900> like<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.410> figured

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
forums and things like that and figured

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.039 
forums and things like that and figured
out<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.799> there<00:04:19.980> was<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.479> problem<00:04:21.479> with<00:04:21.960> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
out that there was a problem with the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.900 
out that there was a problem with the
motherboard<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.680> had<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.310> sent<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.789> back

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
motherboard that I had so I sent it back

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.279 
motherboard that I had so I sent it back
and<00:04:24.120> we're<00:04:24.210> gonna<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.539> exactly<00:04:24.810> how<00:04:25.260> that

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
and we're gonna see exactly how that

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.870 
and we're gonna see exactly how that
works<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.860> also<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> reason<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.669> said

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
works and also the reason I said

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.900 
works and also the reason I said
processor<00:04:27.360> back<00:04:27.510> is<00:04:27.690> some<00:04:28.650> forms<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.220> how-to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
processor back is some forms and how-to

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.160 
processor back is some forms and how-to
videos<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.570> things<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.140> I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
videos and things like that that I

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.350 
videos and things like that that I
watched<00:04:31.410> also<00:04:31.800> said<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.220> processor<00:04:32.790> could<00:04:33.210> be

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
watched also said the processor could be

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.850 
watched also said the processor could be
causing<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.900> issue<00:04:34.020> alongside<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
causing the issue alongside the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.710 
causing the issue alongside the
motherboard<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:35.850> it's<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.540> both

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
motherboard so it's it's it's both

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.840 
motherboard so it's it's it's both
they're<00:04:37.320> both<00:04:37.470> working<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.920> tandem<00:04:38.100> maybe<00:04:38.580> to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
they're both working in tandem maybe to
