00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi my name is mani peace today we are going to do 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.290
 a prawns pie the ingredients 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.060
 that we are going to use are two masses of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.530
 Patty 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.890
 an egg, an onion and some prawns and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.640
 utensils are going to be a one pan with 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.760
 a lid without holes a bowl with a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.250
 strainer 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.050
 for the oven a mold for the oven one 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.369
 lace a scissors a brush and a 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.710
 spoon to spin in wood 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.070
 the prawns are frozen they are going to leave 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.629
 defrost always in the colander and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.890
 let's clean up when they are 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.620
 thawed we take the lace and 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.550
 we cut along the prawn 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.080
 we remove the intestine and thus a column 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 when this is done we will chop the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.090
 onion and we're going to have one hour in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.699
 the 1 at the minimum 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.680
 until it is golden 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.820
 and five more minutes adding the prawns 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.290
 when we do not have this 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.290
 we are going to strain it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.079
 to remove all the liquid 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.070
 and we are going to reserve it 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.070
 and on the other hand we're going to take the dough 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.649
 let's take out 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.649
 mold 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.869
 let's take the dough 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.869
 we're going 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.860
 extend this you have to have 10 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.030
 minutes outside the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.120
 from the fridge at least we're going to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.940
 extend and we will place it in our 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.090
 in our mold we are going to highlight the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.090
 paper 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 what can you call 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.640
 and we're going to put it in the oven for 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.879
 10 minutes at 250 degrees so that the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.810
 part of below we do a little 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.810
 then when it is like this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.569
 so it was already a bit done we're going 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.239
 to bleed 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.239
 let's take our fill 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.510
 we light them a little 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.440
 so let's get everything right 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 extended 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.630
 it is pie you can put zucchini 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.540
 green pepper onion 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.620
 if they want to make it finite they can 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.620
 extend the dough 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.270
 when you are 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.510
 more or less extended we are going to put 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.870
 the other base the top part of 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.870
 our 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.370
 of our empanada 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.670
 we are like this 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.190
 we remove the paper 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.670
 now we are going to do a little hole here 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.670
 for 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.440
 and let the vapors come out 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.379
 and we are going to paint it with the egg 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.970
 so that it looks pretty 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.510
 more or less this brush that you are using 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.130
 me this plastic 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.020
 but you can use any other 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.800
 they can also use another type of 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:25.140
 Puff pastry already tastes and now 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.990
 we're going to have it for 40 minutes at 250 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.760
 degrees observe the tray in the part 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.570
 low so it's done putting 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.930
 below this is very important because 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.030
 if we can not get chewing gum texture 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.670
 and when all that time has passed 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.670
 Well, let's treat it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.840
 and so 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.470
 It is as it should be, it is very good 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.470
 good profit
