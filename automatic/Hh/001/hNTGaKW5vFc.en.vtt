00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:22.210
 Tesla Kit come super today 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:26.590
 laboratory but do not know but also still 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.339
 little lab is seriously early 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.150
 dasha truth by by the scientist can become 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.469
 each 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.450
 and now we will spend with you 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:42.280
 amazing experiment of course kicks 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:45.879
 you will have a separate task to do 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 first you need to change the color here 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:53.649
 this water and why change it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.680
 normal water is white and clear by 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:09.710
 music and a little bit wrong water is not white 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:12.890
 water is colorless thanks kicks share 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.890
 [music] 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.810
 [music] 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.650
 [music] 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.830
 in order for it to become completely 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:57.479
 shake the orange bottle 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:01.600
 ready ready cool experiment 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.330
 beautiful wait bima the most interesting 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:16.580
 still ahead for the experiment we also 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 will need a glass cup of matches and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.739
 [music] 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.540
 plasticine why should we try to fill 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.100
 by water 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:35.440
 inverted glass inverted right there 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.140
 because there is no hole anywhere is physics 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.519
 see take a piece of clay and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.290
 put it on the plate above we poke it 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.370
 match 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.799
 he is dangerous to play with fire 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.770
 asked mom or dad to help you 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:03:01.229
 now pour water 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.229
 [music] 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.079
 so well, dad, everything is clear we pour something in 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.310
 a plate 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.200
 they are in your glass and when will 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.750
 flipped glass 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.079
 first we light a match then we set 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:41.349
 new inverted glass and that glass 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:45.159
 do not believe and that the coin tit is filled 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.159
 pinch me with a knife 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:55.489
 it is still a reality, even too well, as 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:59.650
 did it happen then the water rose 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.650
 glass due to vacuum 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:11.540
 vacuum vacuum is when there is no air 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:16.570
 thus the glass is very low 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:21.199
 pressure around is very high 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:26.750
 clear clear all round presses against the water and 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.349
 glass vacuum it ban everything right 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.990
 beamon 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.510
 you can spend one too 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.449
 experiment with an adult 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 subscribe to the tesla channel from and we will 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:45.580
 conduct new experiments for now 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.490
 choose what you want to see next 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.040
 [music] 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:05.420
 Well 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.420
