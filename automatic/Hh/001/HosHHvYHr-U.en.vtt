00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
got that get the spring up to I've got

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.999 
got that get the spring up to I've got
this<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.340> restore<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> end<00:01:16.009> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
this and restore that at the end that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
this and restore that at the end that
before<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.030> shoot<00:01:30.540> whatever

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
before that this is to shoot whatever

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.710 
before that this is to shoot whatever
you<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> nozzle<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.640> school<00:01:33.299> at

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you put in the nozzle at school at

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:55.899 
you put in the nozzle at school at
people<00:01:37.220> doesn't<00:01:38.270> hurt<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.299> much

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.480 

it<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.720> odd<00:01:59.149> keep<00:02:00.149> forcing<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:03.170> now

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
it can be really odd keep forcing it now

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.339 
it can be really odd keep forcing it now
I've<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.909> thing<00:02:06.319> not<00:02:07.319> sure<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:07.950> does<00:02:08.399> fit

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
I've this thing not sure it it does fit

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.390 
I've this thing not sure it it does fit
so<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.810> might<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> small<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.860> or<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.190> big

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so you might want a small one or a big

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.430 
so you might want a small one or a big
longer<00:02:14.989> whatever<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.140> want<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.440> use<00:02:16.620> for

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
longer whatever you want to use for

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:28.540 
longer whatever you want to use for
first<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.530> all<00:02:19.680> take<00:02:19.890> off<00:02:20.040> this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.420 

pull<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.670> over<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> end<00:02:30.180> like<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:31.250> take<00:02:32.250> this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
pull it over the end like that take this

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:43.990 
pull it over the end like that take this
push<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.390> in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.930 

make<00:02:45.000> sure<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.840> works<00:02:46.280> pull<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.490> like

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
make sure that it works pull on it like

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.680 
make sure that it works pull on it like
that<00:02:48.330> make<00:02:49.200> sure<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:49.590> fly<00:02:49.980> out<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.370> end<00:02:50.690> it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that make sure just fly out the end it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.030 
that make sure just fly out the end it
doesn't<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.350> let's<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.680> back<00:02:54.770> slide<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.920> back

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
doesn't so let's get back slide it back

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.740 
doesn't so let's get back slide it back
in<00:02:56.100> here<00:02:56.990> take<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.610> pull<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> over<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
in here take this pull it over it so

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.160 
in here take this pull it over it so
it's<00:03:00.900> under<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.320> twist<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.430> twist<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.330> twist<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
and tighten it more just because you can

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.630 
and tighten it more just because you can
break<00:03:18.720> off<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.140> stop<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.490> use

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
break off and stop I'm just going to use

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.940 
break off and stop I'm just going to use
to<00:03:20.880> use<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.510> third<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.530> also<00:03:22.620> add

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
to use the third one you can also add

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.680 
to use the third one you can also add
more<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.520> end<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.300> like<00:03:24.830> shoots<00:03:25.830> or

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
more to the end so it like shoots or

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.610 
more to the end so it like shoots or
faster<00:03:29.570> actually<00:03:30.570> i'm<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.720> even<00:03:30.990> using<00:03:31.290> the
