about<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> Pistons<00:00:28.650> pistons<00:00:29.519> update<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
about the Pistons pistons update that

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
about the Pistons pistons update that
that<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.289> came<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.009> new<00:00:32.160> piston

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that just came out the new piston

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.090 
that just came out the new piston
contraptions<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:34.440> got<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> bunch<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
contraptions and we got a bunch of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
contraptions and we got a bunch of
little<00:00:35.219> contraptions<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.000> over<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.780> map

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
little contraptions all over this map

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130 
little contraptions all over this map
just<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:38.940> demonstrations<00:00:39.719> just

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just just for little demonstrations just

just just for little demonstrations just
to<00:00:40.260> show<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:41.219> pistons<00:00:41.910> are

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to show you what these pistons are

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
to show you what these pistons are
capable<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:44.219> guess<00:00:44.489> we'll<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.760> ahead

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
capable of and I guess we'll go ahead

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.229 
capable of and I guess we'll go ahead
and<00:00:44.969> start<00:00:46.039> ok<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.430> piston<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:49.070> is

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
and start ok so this piston here is

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
and start ok so this piston here is
showing<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> only<00:00:52.079> push<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
showing you that you can only push up to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
showing you that you can only push up to
12<00:00:53.480> blocks<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:55.520> anything<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.960> its

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
12 blocks of anything that's that's its

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.290 
12 blocks of anything that's that's its
maximum<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.770> watch<00:00:59.100> I'll<00:00:59.370> destroy<00:00:59.879> I'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
maximum so watch I'll destroy I'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.439 
maximum so watch I'll destroy I'll
destroy<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.899> guy<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> end<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.699> sand

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
destroy this guy in the end this sand

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.820 
destroy this guy in the end this sand
alright<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.619> watch<00:01:05.010> it'll<00:01:05.369> push<00:01:06.290> push<00:01:07.290> ok

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
alright so now watch it'll push push ok

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.670 
alright so now watch it'll push push ok
pushed<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> 12<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> pull<00:01:09.840> back<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.320> sand

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
pushed it 12 now when I pull back a sand

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
pushed it 12 now when I pull back a sand
block<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.189> fall<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.090> can't<00:01:12.299> push

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
block will fall and it can't push

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
block will fall and it can't push
anymore<00:01:14.960> ok<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.290> can't<00:01:16.470> push<00:01:16.680> anymore

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
anymore ok see it can't push anymore

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
anymore ok see it can't push anymore
because<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.640> only<00:01:17.759> push<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> 12<00:01:18.540> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because it can only push up to 12 that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.350 
because it can only push up to 12 that's
one<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.530> about<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.400> Pistons<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
one thing about the Pistons is kind of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.499 
one thing about the Pistons is kind of
like<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> basic<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.590> know

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
like a basic thing you just kind of know

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.160 
like a basic thing you just kind of know
right<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.570> well<00:01:27.570> I'll

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
right here we we got like a well I'll

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.090 
right here we we got like a well I'll
come<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.860> there's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
come back to that because there's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.350 
come back to that because there's
another<00:01:29.310> truck<00:01:29.579> contraption<00:01:30.060> I'll<00:01:30.150> show<00:01:30.299> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
another truck contraption I'll show you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.640 
another truck contraption I'll show you
that's<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.229> thing<00:01:31.290> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that's pretty much the same thing but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
that's pretty much the same thing but
right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:35.030> piston<00:01:36.030> dirt<00:01:36.390> up

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
right here here is the piston dirt up

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
right here here is the piston dirt up
unless<00:01:37.470> there's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> sand<00:01:38.070> block<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
unless there's a sand block there it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
unless there's a sand block there it
will<00:01:39.000> fall<00:01:39.299> back<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.079> since<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> dirt

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
will fall back down but since it's dirt

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
will fall back down but since it's dirt
just<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.340> minecraft<00:01:41.549> things<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.299> will

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
just like all minecraft things it will

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.899 
just like all minecraft things it will
stay<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.409> placed<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.729> how

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stay where it is placed and that's how

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.210 
stay where it is placed and that's how
regular<00:01:45.600> Pistons<00:01:45.990> work<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.409> their<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.920> push

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
regular Pistons work with their you push

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.410 
regular Pistons work with their you push
up<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> stays<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.790> told<00:01:51.000> me<00:01:51.090> it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
up and it stays this he told me it's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.929 
up and it stays this he told me it's
like<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> prototype<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> his<00:01:53.430> video<00:01:53.700> he

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
like a prototype it's on his video he

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.100 
like a prototype it's on his video he
said<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.780> still<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
said it's kind of like it's still like a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.679 
said it's kind of like it's still like a
prototype<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.670> know<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> guys<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.540> work

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
prototype but you know you guys can work

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
prototype but you know you guys can work
with<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.930> figure<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.729> if<00:01:59.729> there's<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
with it figure it all out if there's a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.780 
with it figure it all out if there's a
gap<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.200> pull<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> lever<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> look

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
gap you just pull the lever and look

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.249 
gap you just pull the lever and look
it's<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.270> bridge<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.049> it's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
it's like a little bridge I know it's

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.999 
it's like a little bridge I know it's
kind<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> checkered<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:07.229> could<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.469> fixed

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
kind of checkered and it could be fixed

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
comes up there's all those repeaters and

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.759 
comes up there's all those repeaters and
everything<00:02:38.290> these<00:02:38.650> are<00:02:38.829> sticky<00:02:39.359> sticky

everything these are sticky sticky

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.640 
everything these are sticky sticky
pistons<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.389> you<00:02:43.389> pull<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:43.840> lever<00:02:44.049> those

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
pistons and you pull the lever those

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.330 
pistons and you pull the lever those
push<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.760> Pistons<00:02:46.209> are<00:02:46.420> pushed<00:02:47.139> and<00:02:47.500> then

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
push out the Pistons are pushed and then

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.759 
push out the Pistons are pushed and then
you<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:49.150> go<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.450> your<00:02:49.569> house<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.049> know<00:02:50.500> keep

show you in third person see I pull a
pull<00:03:19.900> or<00:03:20.169> push<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.859> lever<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.220> yeah<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.549> pushes

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
pull or push the lever it yeah it pushes

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.420 
pull or push the lever it yeah it pushes
cool<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.569> then<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.780> doesn't<00:03:22.810> call<00:03:23.379> back<00:03:23.590> even

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
cool and then it doesn't call back even

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.289 
cool and then it doesn't call back even
though<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.840> sticky<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:27.310> he<00:03:27.819> figured<00:03:28.150> out

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
though it is a sticky so he figured out

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.189 
though it is a sticky so he figured out
that<00:03:28.720> once<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:30.370> piston<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.150> once<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.840> piston

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
that once this piston is once a piston

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.920 
that once this piston is once a piston
is<00:03:32.319> open<00:03:32.739> if<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.489> sticky<00:03:33.849> piston<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.480> behind<00:03:34.750> it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
is open if a sticky piston is behind it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.780 
is open if a sticky piston is behind it
it<00:03:35.049> can't<00:03:35.379> pull<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.739> back<00:03:35.889> because<00:03:36.129> it's<00:03:36.549> open

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
it can't pull it back because it's open

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.759 
it can't pull it back because it's open
the<00:03:37.389> piston<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.930> open<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.379> can't<00:03:38.590> pull<00:03:38.739> it

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
the piston is open you can't pull it

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.030 
the piston is open you can't pull it
back<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.579> what<00:03:39.729> you<00:03:39.819> do<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.260> put<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.440> redstone

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
back so what you do is put a redstone

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.439 
back so what you do is put a redstone
repeater<00:03:42.729> down<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:44.729> you<00:03:45.729> I'm<00:03:45.970> gonna<00:03:46.090> push<00:03:46.329> it

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
repeater down and you I'm gonna push it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:52.409 
repeater down and you I'm gonna push it
back<00:03:46.569> one<00:03:46.750> notch<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.879> see<00:03:48.879> watch<00:03:49.599> this<00:03:51.419> see

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
back one notch and see watch this see

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.629 
back one notch and see watch this see
there's<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.840> delay<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.810> pulls<00:03:56.169> it<00:03:56.409> back<00:03:56.639> the

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
there's a delay so it pulls it back the

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.610 
there's a delay so it pulls it back the
one<00:03:57.879> closes<00:03:58.359> first<00:03:58.659> and<00:03:58.900> then<00:03:59.139> it<00:03:59.319> can<00:03:59.440> pull

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
one closes first and then it can pull

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.890 
one closes first and then it can pull
back<00:03:59.909> make<00:04:00.909> something<00:04:01.269> cool<00:04:01.389> with<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.659> guy's

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
back make something cool with that guy's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.599 
back make something cool with that guy's
redstone<00:04:02.440> repeaters<00:04:02.889> are<00:04:03.099> starting<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.489> be

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
redstone repeaters are starting to be

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.210 
redstone repeaters are starting to be
used<00:04:03.639> a<00:04:03.940> lot<00:04:04.209> now<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.769> can<00:04:05.889> figure<00:04:06.129> all

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
used a lot now and you can figure all

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.809 
used a lot now and you can figure all
that<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.549> okay<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.120> first<00:04:07.269> or<00:04:08.139> on<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.729> the

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
that out okay but first or on to the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.649 
that out okay but first or on to the
next<00:04:10.120> on<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.109> next<00:04:11.400> contraption<00:04:12.400> here

next on to the next contraption here

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.390 
next on to the next contraption here
pretend<00:04:13.659> this<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.500> your<00:04:14.650> inside<00:04:15.129> of<00:04:15.159> your
