can<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.680> but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
can see that but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.230 
can see that but
sorry<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> bad<00:02:33.210> quality<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.460> yeah<00:02:35.460> same

sorry for the bad quality but yeah same
thing<00:02:37.490> 000<00:02:39.290> 28<00:02:41.720> f4f<00:02:42.720> right<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.670> get

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
thing 000 28 f4f right there and you get

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.340 
thing 000 28 f4f right there and you get
rid<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> backwards<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.840> pairs<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.620> by<00:02:47.060> 22<00:02:48.060> pairs

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
rid of backwards in pairs so by 22 pairs

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.740 
rid of backwards in pairs so by 22 pairs
so<00:02:49.350> for<00:02:49.770> f<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.700> pair<00:02:52.130> AF<00:02:53.330> let's<00:02:54.330> second

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
so for f that's one pair AF let's second

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.480 
so for f that's one pair AF let's second
pair<00:02:54.930> 0<00:02:55.860> 2<00:02:56.130> 0<00:02:56.420> 0

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.830 

so<00:03:01.030> normally<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:02.500> would<00:03:02.620> be<00:03:03.510> zero<00:03:04.510> zero<00:03:04.780> zero

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
so normally it would be zero zero zero

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.670 
so normally it would be zero zero zero
two<00:03:05.470> eight<00:03:06.840> f4f<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.120> read<00:03:10.300> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
two eight f4f and you have to read it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.800 
two eight f4f and you have to read it
backwards<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.920> pairs<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:13.420> getting<00:03:13.690> it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
backwards in pairs just getting it

you change it to whatever you want it to
be<00:03:33.460> I'm<00:03:34.090> going<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.300> be<00:03:34.390> changing<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.140> Diagon

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
be I'm going to be changing it to Diagon

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.990 
be I'm going to be changing it to Diagon
right<00:03:37.120> here<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.610> code<00:03:40.090> says<00:03:42.000> 0001

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
right here right now the code says 0001

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.200 
right here right now the code says 0001
e<00:03:44.190> 64<00:03:45.190> e<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.780> gotta<00:03:47.230> read<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.220> backwards<00:03:48.610> in

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
e 64 e and I gotta read it backwards in

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.730 
e 64 e and I gotta read it backwards in
pairs<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.190> meaning<00:03:51.490> this<00:03:52.480> here<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.170> my<00:03:53.320> ring<00:03:53.560> as

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
pairs so meaning this here is my ring as

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.610 
pairs so meaning this here is my ring as
you<00:03:54.400> all<00:03:54.520> know<00:03:54.550> I'm<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.870> changing<00:03:56.230> it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you all know I'm going to be changing it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:10.390 
you all know I'm going to be changing it
to<00:03:58.140> 4e<00:04:05.010> e60<00:04:07.140> 100

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.650
