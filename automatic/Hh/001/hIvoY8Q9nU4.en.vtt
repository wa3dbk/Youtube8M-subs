 quiet we were all waiting and what 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.650
 I felt like hot the boy I feel 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.269
 I should have won yes but I think 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.640
 that he lacked, I think he lacked a 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.079
 little bit more to beat that one is a 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.940
 groso monster I think I can beat them 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.680
 but that intensity that got him at 4 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.329
 romantically he gave them the 12 because if not 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.349
 he paints your face he beat them with 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.299
 side glove in a moment 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.709
