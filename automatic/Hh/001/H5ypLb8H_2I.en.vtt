little bit of hydrogen peroxide on it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.270 
little bit of hydrogen peroxide on it
right<00:00:37.410> after<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
e-coli right off of your fruit and
vegetables<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
vegetables you can also use it on

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250

peroxide bottle and I use that to spray
right<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> hydrogen<00:01:33.540> peroxide

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
right out of the hydrogen peroxide

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050 
right out of the hydrogen peroxide
bottle<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.680> terms<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.340> strength<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.939> use

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
bottle in terms of strength you can use

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789 
bottle in terms of strength you can use
the<00:01:36.210> hydrogen<00:01:36.450> peroxide<00:01:36.750> directly<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> don't

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the hydrogen peroxide directly you don't

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.649 
the hydrogen peroxide directly you don't
have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> dilute<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> vinegar

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
have to dilute that with the vinegar

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the hydrogen peroxide in one single

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
the hydrogen peroxide in one single
bottle<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> spray<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.219> answer<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
bottle and spray that the answer is

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
bottle and spray that the answer is
absolutely<00:01:56.850> no<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.930> creates<00:01:58.350> peracetic<00:01:59.070> acid

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
absolutely no it creates peracetic acid

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
absolutely no it creates peracetic acid
and<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> can<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.329> actually<00:02:00.509> very<00:02:00.719> harmful

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and that can be actually very harmful

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.889 
and that can be actually very harmful
it's<00:02:02.100> okay<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.700> spray<00:02:03.090> them<00:02:03.299> one<00:02:03.509> after

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the other but putting them in the same

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.029 
the other but putting them in the same
bottle<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.820> actually<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.420> harmful<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.860> there

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
bottle is actually very harmful so there

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.499 
bottle is actually very harmful so there
you<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.520> instead<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.000> using<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
