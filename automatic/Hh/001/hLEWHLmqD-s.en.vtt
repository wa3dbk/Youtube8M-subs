part we're gonna line in her top part
flip<00:04:31.540> back<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.780> eye<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.260> get<00:04:32.410> in<00:04:32.530> there<00:04:32.740> it's

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
flip back the eye and get in there it's

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.690 
flip back the eye and get in there it's
gross<00:04:34.650> it's<00:04:35.650> really<00:04:35.980> hard<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.310> do<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:36.610> it

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
gross it's really hard to do but it

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.530

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.210 

I<00:04:39.570> think<00:04:40.020> even<00:04:40.320> right<00:04:40.470> now<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.040> probably

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
I think even right now this is probably

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.800 
I think even right now this is probably
too<00:04:41.610> structured<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.360> I'm<00:04:42.480> gonna<00:04:42.600> add

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
too structured so I'm gonna add

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.380 
too structured so I'm gonna add
something<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.880> push<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.060> up<00:04:45.210> and

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
something to kind of push it up and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.740 
something to kind of push it up and
really<00:04:45.600> get<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.080> little<00:04:46.980> crazier<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:48.630> we're

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
really get it a little crazier so we're

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.080 
really get it a little crazier so we're
gonna<00:04:48.840> use<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.050> gloss<00:04:49.350> on<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.220> eye<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> move
