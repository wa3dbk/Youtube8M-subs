understand the core mechanics of
becoming<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.619> hitter<00:00:29.029> for<00:00:30.029> many<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
becoming a good hitter for many of the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.939 
becoming a good hitter for many of the
coaches<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:30.929> heating<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.740> be

coaches out there heating can be

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.760 
coaches out there heating can be
somewhat<00:00:32.640> confusing<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.260> listen<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
somewhat confusing you can listen to one

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
somewhat confusing you can listen to one
hitting<00:00:35.010> instructor<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.030> they're<00:00:36.120> gonna<00:00:36.239> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
hitting instructor and they're gonna go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
hitting instructor and they're gonna go
ahead<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.750> emphasize<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.500> thing<00:00:37.700> you<00:00:38.700> listen

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ahead and emphasize one thing you listen

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520 
ahead and emphasize one thing you listen
to<00:00:39.090> another<00:00:39.329> instructor<00:00:39.930> they're<00:00:40.350> gonna

emphasize another thing my goal today is
to<00:00:43.260> give<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.860> core<00:00:44.219> mechanics<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.660> are

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to give you the core mechanics that are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.190 
to give you the core mechanics that are
necessary<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.980> being<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.430> hitter<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.200> bet

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
necessary to being a good hitter I bet

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.279 
necessary to being a good hitter I bet
at<00:00:49.289> UCLA<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.800> many<00:00:50.489> years<00:00:50.789> over<00:00:51.030> 24<00:00:51.629> years<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
at UCLA for many years over 24 years and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
at UCLA for many years over 24 years and
the<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.190> thing<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> found<00:00:53.820> among

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the one thing that I have found among

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
the one thing that I have found among
all<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.140> great<00:00:55.379> hitters<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> come

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
all the great hitters that have come

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.130 
all the great hitters that have come
through<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.670> program<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.629> may<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.960> all

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
through this program they may not all

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.790 
through this program they may not all
look<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> same

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
look the same

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
look the same
when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.789> swing<00:01:00.199> but<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
when you see them swing but when you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.009 
when you see them swing but when you
break<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.710> their<00:01:02.100> core<00:01:02.430> mechanics<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.809> all

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
break down their core mechanics they all

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.700 
break down their core mechanics they all
possess<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.400> proper<00:01:05.820> core<00:01:06.060> mechanics<00:01:06.710> let's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
possess the proper core mechanics let's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
possess the proper core mechanics let's
go<00:01:07.860> ahead<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> talk<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.760> bit<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
go ahead and talk a little bit about the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
go ahead and talk a little bit about the
hitter<00:01:09.689> before<00:01:10.200> she<00:01:10.409> steps<00:01:10.710> into<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> box

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
hitter before she steps into the box

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850 
hitter before she steps into the box
which<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.970> important<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> think

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
which is important to know and think

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
which is important to know and think
about<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> player<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> coach<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
about as a player and as a coach the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
about as a player and as a coach the
first<00:01:16.830> thing<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:17.759> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
first thing you have to think about is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.410 
first thing you have to think about is
physically<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.950> strong<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:21.150> they<00:01:21.299> have

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
physically are they strong do they have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.679 
physically are they strong do they have
a<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.720> core<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.530> their<00:01:23.130> torso<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> their

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a good core in their torso and their

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
a good core in their torso and their
legs<00:01:24.930> especially<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.400> inner<00:01:26.610> thigh<00:01:26.970> muscles

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
legs especially the inner thigh muscles

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950 
legs especially the inner thigh muscles
and<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> quadricep<00:01:28.860> muscles<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.299> forearm<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and the quadricep muscles the forearm in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.550 
and the quadricep muscles the forearm in
the<00:01:30.990> wrist

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the wrist

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.429 
the wrist
are<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.460> strong<00:01:32.900> because<00:01:33.900> you've<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> be

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
are they strong because you've got to be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
are they strong because you've got to be
able<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.799> good<00:01:35.100> back<00:01:35.340> control<00:01:35.640> when

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
able to have good back control when

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560 
able to have good back control when
you're<00:01:36.689> swinging<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> softball<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:39.450> got

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you're swinging at the softball you got

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.899 
you're swinging at the softball you got
to<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.780> good<00:01:39.810> vision<00:01:40.310> make<00:01:41.310> sure<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> both

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to have good vision make sure that both

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.020 
to have good vision make sure that both
eyes<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.659> focused<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.500> ball<00:01:43.770> many<00:01:44.729> times

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
eyes are focused on that ball many times

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
eyes are focused on that ball many times
the<00:01:45.180> batter<00:01:45.390> sets<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> box<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.829> they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the batter sets up in the box and they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
the batter sets up in the box and they
don't<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.520> their<00:01:47.729> head<00:01:47.939> completely<00:01:48.810> turned

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
don't have their head completely turned

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.460 
don't have their head completely turned
where<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> back<00:01:50.640> eye<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.299> focusing<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.320> the
