00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.999
 name is andy and today they 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.129
 will teach you how to make delicious crepes 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.469
 integrals that are really 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.210
 delicious are super easy to make and 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.190
 They are also perfect for breakfast or 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.540
 also as dessert the time of 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.480
 preparation and cooking time 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.010
 combined is less than 10 minutes I hope 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.010
 that this medium like us let's start 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.329
 The ingredients for this recipe are 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.350
 a cup of wholemeal flour two eggs 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.970
 large half cup of milk half a cup 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.660
 of water 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.790
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.930
 a spoonful of agave or milk 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.670
 Bee a quarter teaspoon of salt and 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.890
 a little butter to cook the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.220
 crepes 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 let us begin 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.720
 in a bowl we are going to mix the flour 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.050
 integral with a quarter teaspoon of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.470
 salt stir well and reserve this mixture 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 for a moment 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.229
 in another bowl we are going to beat the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.200
 liquid ingredients that are eggs 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.350
 and we're going to beat them with milk water 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.869
 the agave or honey and the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.369
 Vanilla extract but it returns well 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.740
 so that the eggs are well beaten 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.959
 with the rest of the ingredients and already 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.549
 that is all right now we are going 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.310
 to incorporate the liquid ingredients 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.380
 with the dry ingredients so let's go 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.420
 to add the mixture of the eggs on 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 the flour and we're going to stir everything up 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.579
 well for us to have a smooth mix 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.439
 I think my mix has been a little 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.229
 thick so I'm going to add 2 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.750
 more spoons of milk and I'll stir 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.090
 again the consistency they seek in 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.679
 the mixture for crepes is similar to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.569
 the liquid cream 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.819
 so if you think your mix is â€‹â€‹very 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.159
 thick you can add a little more 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.829
 milk or a little more water to 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.329
 get the desired consistency since 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.489
 have the desired consistency in the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.609
 mix now let's let it rest by 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:08.140
 approximately 30 minutes or one hour 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.660
 this will allow the bran or the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.090
 protein in the flour softens a bit 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.930
 and as a result it will give us some crepes 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.480
 super soft 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.129
 after 30 minutes or an hour now 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.109
 in a pan over medium heat we go to 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.819
 melt a little butter and 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.980
 on this we are going to add a bit of the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.540
 mix for the crepes I'm 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.189
 using a soft bucket but for 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.989
 make the crepes but if you prefer 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.329
 can use a little less than 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.340
 mix and since we have added the 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.379
 mix to the pan now let's lift 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.780
 the pan a little bit and we will move it 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.579
 with a circular movement only 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.590
 so that the cream or the mixture of 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.049
 cream spreads very well on the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.150
 surface of the pan and let's cook 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.909
 the cream for about 40 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.250
 seconds a minute on each side or up 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.409
 that is well cooked since the cream 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.079
 is cooked from the first side will be a 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.790
 little dry and the whole contour will take a 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.370
 little bit of color so when that 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.379
 happen you turn it around and then the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.950
 kitchen on that second side for about 40 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.950
 more seconds 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.730
 let's continue cooking the crepes 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 until they are all ready 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.390
 and here I have them all ready with 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.770
 this amount of flour came out 8 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.510
 pretty large crepes 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.910
 I'm going to serve them with a little 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 syrup or strawberry milk this just told 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.020
 make only one and a half cups of 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.270
 strawberries and sprinkle them with a little 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.730
 of sugar with about half 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.940
 spoonful of sugar and add them 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.710
 also two tablespoons of water and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.620
 I put to heat for about 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.020
 15 or 20 minutes over medium-high heat and that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.030
 It's all to serve the crepes I'm going to 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.950
 fold in half and then again 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.500
 in half so that I stay as if 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.030
 they were a fan I will accompany them 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.330
 with fresh fruit I am using 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.800
 bananas and strawberry and I'm going to add a 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.390
 little bit of strawberry honey on the 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 crepas and I'm also going to add a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.080
 little bit of melted chocolate and that's 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.080
 all good profit 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.340
