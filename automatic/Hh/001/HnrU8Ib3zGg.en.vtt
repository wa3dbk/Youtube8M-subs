00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:09.080
 Hi everyone I would like to introduce a new dj server this time 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.110
 Some people may have noticed 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:20.660
 Previous dg server Well dg official é¯– has disappeared 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:26.660
 Because yes this time I had to go to all of the plug-in and the mother company in the new server 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.740
 There should not be so much bugs Well I 'm going to put out with this official announcement video Maru- kun soon 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:37.820
 So I would like to explain it a bit more 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:40.650
 This video will be spawned here first and foremost on this and m like this 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.220
 b member is standing like this, but until the book 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.700
 Because it is not real, I usually put it this way Higashiyama 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.070
 That 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.610
 That you do not be fooled Yes because to say that I balsa balsa might we not fast 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 Please give me 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.990
 You have people who have cheated 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.520
 Heh I am really 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.829
 And there 's something strange little kids and girls that didn't mean until then 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.740
 Finally 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.480
 Now you can buy items with the game par money in Micra 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.909
 For example how to right-click on this and buy 200 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.930
 Because it's $ 50 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.090
 2 Construction Doma 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.640
 When it is taken from the wallet and you want to dive with Mauri, it was sold by right-clicking on the guy above 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.580
 In Yes it is here but here is food 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.190
 There is a block here and there is a pickel here 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.610
 Yes, it's a nose game if you go next 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.730
 What is different from this is this is the Nether Portal 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.400
 hey 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.000
 New Hunger Games 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.550
 I went to Stone wisdom lobby a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.280
 This is right 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:56.510
 Robi Naa I made with me and Maruki min and Junki all 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.300
 For now, there are only two Hunger Games maps, but more 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:04.310
 I will add more 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.960
 Pbp arena which I had before when I went to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 Yes there is no rules like Hunger Games that normally fight freely 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.500
 Fight freely 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 Well then paint 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.180
 When taking the Aso portal, you have to wait for 10 seconds until you enter the next porter after 10 seconds 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 Yes 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:38.270
 If you can buy vip, you'll have a great time 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:38.270
 At the official site, I already bought about 4 people so far, but this is bap. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.360
 I came in when I right-click while taking a slice 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.920
 Just like this I can sit here, yes that's it 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.750

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.920
 Another voyage's your Twitter in twitter that you have people who are building a house in 8

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:17.050
 Yes I made a common nether, so when I want to go there I go through 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.340
 This is the Nether Tankan 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.400
 I can do it 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.450
 But what we want to introduce in a nutshell is adding a world called Support World. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.410
 Better was 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.569

 I don't know about once a week but I'm going to reset 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.180
 This world has some rules 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.500
