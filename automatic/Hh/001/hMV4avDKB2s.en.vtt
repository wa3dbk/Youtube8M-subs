few threads you want to screw it all the
way<00:00:10.410> down<00:00:10.440> till<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.070> stops<00:00:12.650> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.799> just

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
way down till it stops you can just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.660 
way down till it stops you can just
screw<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.250> down<00:00:14.280> by<00:00:14.610> hand<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.369> 12

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
screw it down by hand and this is a 12

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
screw it down by hand and this is a 12
millimeter<00:00:17.850> jam<00:00:18.390> nut<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:18.990> uses<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.410> 19

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
millimeter jam nut and it uses a 19

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890 
millimeter jam nut and it uses a 19
millimeter<00:00:20.520> wrench<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.359> lock<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> down

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
millimeter wrench to lock it down

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.109 
millimeter wrench to lock it down
however<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> three-quarter<00:00:23.340> inch<00:00:23.519> works<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
however a three-quarter inch works just

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
however a three-quarter inch works just
fine<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.600> well<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.650> found<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.460> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
fine as well we have found so if you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.830 
fine as well we have found so if you
don't<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.789> metric<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.390> large<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
don't have metric this large a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
don't have metric this large a
three-quarter<00:00:28.349> will<00:00:28.500> work<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
three-quarter will work you just want to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
three-quarter will work you just want to
stick<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> over<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> jam<00:00:31.230> nut<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.940> then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
stick that over the jam nut and then

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
stick that over the jam nut and then
just<00:00:33.300> turn<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> clockwise<00:00:34.350> until<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.460> locks

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
just turn it clockwise until it locks

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.760 
just turn it clockwise until it locks
down<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> want<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.440> tight

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
down now you want to get on this tight

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.200 
down now you want to get on this tight
but<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> don't<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> whole<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
but you don't want to put a whole lot of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
but you don't want to put a whole lot of
pressure<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> assembly<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pressure on the assembly so what I

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.610 
pressure on the assembly so what I
always<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> grab<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.149> my<00:00:42.230> right<00:00:43.230> arm

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and hold it very stiff while I'm

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
and hold it very stiff while I'm
tightening<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.850> tight<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.750> puts

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
tightening it really tight it just puts

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.100 
tightening it really tight it just puts
less<00:00:49.230> stress<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> whole<00:00:50.070> reverse<00:00:51.110> lockout

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
less stress on the whole reverse lockout

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
less stress on the whole reverse lockout
assembly<00:00:52.829> okay<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.149> lock<00:00:54.300> washers<00:00:54.750> hold

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
assembly okay and the lock washers hold

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
assembly okay and the lock washers hold
it<00:00:55.050> secure<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.789> note<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> we

it secure now one thing to note that we

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.700 
it secure now one thing to note that we
talked<00:00:57.449> about<00:00:57.539> earlier<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> have
