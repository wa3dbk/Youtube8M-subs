your painting schemes this started

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.389 
your painting schemes this started
because<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.779> question<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.320> dan<00:00:31.529> kane<00:00:31.859> AKA

Death Bringer from 11th Legion asked me
what<00:00:35.550> color<00:00:35.730> scheme<00:00:36.090> does<00:00:36.329> attorney<00:00:36.719> needs

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
what color scheme does attorney needs

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750 
what color scheme does attorney needs
need<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:37.649> good<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> make

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
need to look good you know to make

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
need to look good you know to make
certain<00:00:39.059> things<00:00:39.420> stand<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.200> um<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:42.120> just

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
certain things stand out and um it just

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
certain things stand out and um it just
happened<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.809> studied<00:00:43.440> graphic<00:00:43.590> design

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
happened that I studied graphic design

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
happened that I studied graphic design
so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> had<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> study<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.270> school<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so I had to study this at school so I

collect<00:00:47.670> theory<00:00:48.350> there's<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> couple<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.739> tools

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
collect theory there's a couple of tools

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
collect theory there's a couple of tools
that<00:00:50.129> could<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:51.030> life<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.420> lot

that could make you your life a lot
easier<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:52.199> selecting<00:00:52.680> painting<00:00:53.010> schemes

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
easier when selecting painting schemes

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
easier when selecting painting schemes
the<00:00:54.360> first<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> foremost<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.489> most

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the first first and foremost the most

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
the first first and foremost the most
important<00:00:57.210> thing<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:58.469> am<00:00:58.680> i<00:00:58.770> doing<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
important thing is why am i doing a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
important thing is why am i doing a
tutorial<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> color<00:01:00.120> theory<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.719> might

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
tutorial on a color theory it might

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
tutorial on a color theory it might
sound<00:01:01.020> boring<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.770> my<00:01:01.859> time<00:01:02.070> boring<00:01:02.489> or

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
sound boring right in my time boring or

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
sound boring right in my time boring or
you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.049> people<00:01:04.320> don't<00:01:04.799> even<00:01:04.890> want<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you know some people don't even want to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
you know some people don't even want to
talk<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.850> color<00:01:06.270> theory<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.869> example

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
talk about color theory like for example

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
talk about color theory like for example
Chun<00:01:07.470> Chun<00:01:08.280> doesn't<00:01:08.549> really<00:01:08.700> care<00:01:08.939> about

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
Chun Chun doesn't really care about

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
Chun Chun doesn't really care about
color<00:01:09.299> theory<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.840> long<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.590> thing<00:01:10.860> looks

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
color theory as long as the thing looks

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
color theory as long as the thing looks
good<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> model<00:01:12.390> looks<00:01:12.420> good<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.320> he

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
good the model looks good that's all he

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
good the model looks good that's all he
cares<00:01:13.650> about<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:15.350> but<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:17.520> color<00:01:17.729> theory

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
cares about so but I think color theory

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.920 
cares about so but I think color theory
is<00:01:18.180> important<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> know

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
is important because you have to know

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.520 
is important because you have to know
why<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.650> looks<00:01:23.070> good<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> how<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.259> copy

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
why it looks good and how can you copy

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
why it looks good and how can you copy
it<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> next<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.330> how

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it for the next time like you know how

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.270 
it for the next time like you know how
can<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> let's<00:01:28.439> say<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.710> doing<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
can you let's say you're doing a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.609 
can you let's say you're doing a
thousand<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> hundred<00:01:30.450> space<00:01:31.020> marines<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
thousand or a hundred space marines and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.990 
thousand or a hundred space marines and
you<00:01:31.740> wanted<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> make<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.340> own<00:01:32.460> color<00:01:32.700> scheme

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you wanted to make your own color scheme

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
you wanted to make your own color scheme
and<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.630> how<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> make<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.439> look

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and you don't know how to make it look

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
and you don't know how to make it look
good<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.640> tools<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> help

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
good so these tools are going to help

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
good so these tools are going to help
you<00:01:36.689> i'm<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> list<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.920> tools

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you i'm just going to list two tools

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.780 
you i'm just going to list two tools
that<00:01:38.369> i<00:01:38.430> usually<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.549> first

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that i usually use the first the first

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.230 
that i usually use the first the first
one<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.930> color<00:01:43.140> wheel<00:01:43.380> right<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
one is the color wheel right here the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.960 
one is the color wheel right here the
color<00:01:45.450> wheel<00:01:45.659> um<00:01:45.930> i'm<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> give<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.790> own

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
color wheel um i'm going to give my own

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.569 
color wheel um i'm going to give my own
definition<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> color<00:01:49.079> wheel<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:50.310> shows

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
definition of the color wheel it shows

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
definition of the color wheel it shows
all<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> spectrum<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.350> usually<00:01:52.619> found

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
all the spectrum that you usually found

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.969 
all the spectrum that you usually found
find<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> rainbow<00:01:54.630> obviously<00:01:55.439> white<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
find on a rainbow obviously white and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.429 
find on a rainbow obviously white and
black<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.810> white<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
black as not here because white and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
black as not here because white and
black<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.890> considered<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> shade<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
black are considered a shade so if you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
black are considered a shade so if you
add<00:02:00.570> white<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.079> black<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.189> colors<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
add white or black into these colors is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
add white or black into these colors is
just<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.780> change<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.290> hue<00:02:04.590> or

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
just going to you know change the hue or

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.630 
just going to you know change the hue or
the<00:02:05.670> actual<00:02:06.560> shading<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> colors<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the actual shading of the colors and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.470 
the actual shading of the colors and
let's<00:02:09.300> start<00:02:09.569> off<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.530> primary<00:02:10.739> colors

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
let's start off with the primary colors

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.589 
let's start off with the primary colors
which<00:02:11.569> are<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.870> blue<00:02:12.260> red<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.040> yellows<00:02:13.599> if

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
which are the blue red and yellows if

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.149 
which are the blue red and yellows if
you<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.930> see<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.319> from<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.709> color<00:02:15.920> wheel

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
you can see it from the color wheel

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.350 
you can see it from the color wheel
right<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.879> actually<00:02:17.450> makes<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.260> triangle

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
right here it actually makes a triangle

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.910 
right here it actually makes a triangle
these<00:02:20.360> are<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.690> three<00:02:21.049> most<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.739> colors

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
these are the three most of the colors

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.550 
these are the three most of the colors
that<00:02:22.310> are<00:02:22.549> really<00:02:23.480> really<00:02:23.690> hard<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> work<00:02:24.349> with

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that are really really hard to work with

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.860 
that are really really hard to work with
if<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.549> combine<00:02:25.909> all<00:02:26.090> those<00:02:26.239> three<00:02:26.480> colors

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
if you combine all those three colors

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.220 
if you combine all those three colors
I've<00:02:27.470> seen<00:02:27.739> them<00:02:28.540> painted<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:29.959> in

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
I've seen them painted really well in

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.400 
I've seen them painted really well in
some<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.129> Empire<00:02:31.519> models<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.269> if<00:02:32.959> you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
some of the Empire models and if you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
some of the Empire models and if you
know<00:02:33.590> how<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.769> make<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.160> work<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.549> will<00:02:34.730> work<00:02:34.760> so

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
know how to make it work it will work so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.020 
know how to make it work it will work so
those<00:02:35.750> three<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.110> always<00:02:36.620> trying<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.069> grab

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
those three are always trying to grab

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.490 
those three are always trying to grab
your<00:02:38.269> attention<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.959> know<00:02:39.079> in<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.260> eyes

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
your attention you know in your eyes

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.520 
your attention you know in your eyes
always<00:02:40.360> some<00:02:41.360> colors<00:02:41.659> work<00:02:41.840> really<00:02:42.049> well<00:02:42.170> so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
always some colors work really well so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.140 
always some colors work really well so
if<00:02:42.680> you're<00:02:42.829> working<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.220> pairs<00:02:43.549> they<00:02:43.940> look

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
if you're working with pairs they look

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.460 
if you're working with pairs they look
pretty<00:02:44.299> good<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:45.459> McDonald's<00:02:46.459> in<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.849> out

fast food is like that it's obviously

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.449 
fast food is like that it's obviously
because<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.840> works<00:02:54.730> supposedly<00:02:55.730> there<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.720> a

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
because it works supposedly there is a

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.490 
because it works supposedly there is a
study<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.700> says<00:02:58.760> if<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.599> combine<00:02:59.959> red<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
study that says if you combine red and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
study that says if you combine red and
yellow<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.920> make<00:03:01.250> people<00:03:01.459> hungry<00:03:01.790> or<00:03:02.209> they

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
which from the color wheel you're going

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.140 
which from the color wheel you're going
to<00:03:17.599> switch<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.959> up<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.169> little<00:03:18.380> bit<00:03:19.150> basically

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
to switch it up a little bit basically

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.509 
to switch it up a little bit basically
all<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.450> triangles<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.099> can<00:03:22.280> kind

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
all the triangles you just you can kind

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.970 
all the triangles you just you can kind
of<00:03:22.609> switch<00:03:22.849> it<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:24.019> opposite<00:03:24.650> colors

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
of switch it and you see opposite colors

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.150 
of switch it and you see opposite colors
as<00:03:25.160> well<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:26.060> if<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.359> want<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.660> make<00:03:26.810> certain

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
as well so if you want to make certain

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.500 
as well so if you want to make certain
colors<00:03:28.160> pop<00:03:28.519> up<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.030> actually<00:03:29.389> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
colors pop up this is actually the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.839 
colors pop up this is actually the
question<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:29.930> Death<00:03:30.859> Bringer<00:03:31.069> brought<00:03:31.700> up

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
question that Death Bringer brought up

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.580 
question that Death Bringer brought up
to<00:03:32.000> me<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.630> showed<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.109> color<00:03:33.349> wheel

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
to me and I showed them the color wheel

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.710 
to me and I showed them the color wheel
Enys<00:03:33.889> like<00:03:34.099> what<00:03:34.310> is<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.489> color<00:03:34.700> wheel<00:03:34.940> well

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
Enys like what is the color wheel well

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.900 
Enys like what is the color wheel well
this<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:36.980> color<00:03:37.160> wheel<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.760> is

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
this is this is the color wheel this is

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.750 
this is this is the color wheel this is
all<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.269> colors<00:03:38.599> that<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.049> see<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
all the colors that you can see and the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.490 
all the colors that you can see and the
way<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.180> use<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.480> color<00:03:41.690> wheel<00:03:41.930> tool<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
way that you use the color wheel tool is

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.979 
way that you use the color wheel tool is
if<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.700> want<00:03:43.940> me<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.269> make<00:03:44.389> certain<00:03:44.599> things

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
with it like I I study design and I have

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.310 
with it like I I study design and I have
to<00:04:28.250> actually<00:04:28.640> memorized<00:04:29.360> not<00:04:29.780> memorized<00:04:30.200> but

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
hopefully with the color wheel it will

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.970 
hopefully with the color wheel it will
make<00:04:34.670> your<00:04:34.820> life<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.150> lot<00:04:35.270> easier<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:36.290> couple

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
using the color wheel if you notice

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.580 
using the color wheel if you notice
there's<00:04:41.180> every<00:04:41.720> color<00:04:41.900> that's<00:04:42.230> two<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.530> the

colors next to it if you wanted to make

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.540 
colors next to it if you wanted to make
something<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.990> blends<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:45.740> really<00:04:45.770> well<00:04:46.100> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
something that blends in really well you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.200 
something that blends in really well you
can<00:04:47.300> do<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.890> know<00:04:49.010> one<00:04:49.220> color<00:04:49.490> on<00:04:49.730> each<00:04:49.760> sides

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
can do you know one color on each sides

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.420 
can do you know one color on each sides
like<00:04:50.480> for<00:04:50.630> example<00:04:50.720> you're<00:04:51.200> doing<00:04:51.500> green<00:04:51.830> you

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
like for example you're doing green you

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.490 
like for example you're doing green you
can<00:04:52.580> always<00:04:52.820> do<00:04:53.030> yellow<00:04:53.330> green<00:04:53.660> or<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.290> can

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
can always do yellow green or you can

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.270 
can always do yellow green or you can
always<00:04:54.650> do<00:04:54.920> blue<00:04:55.220> green<00:04:56.560> okay<00:04:57.560> as<00:04:57.830> long<00:04:58.010> as<00:04:58.190> it

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
always do blue green okay as long as it

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.700 
always do blue green okay as long as it
has<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.490> green<00:04:58.700> on<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.510> will<00:04:59.660> create<00:05:00.260> like

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
has the green on it it will create like

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.500 
has the green on it it will create like
they<00:05:01.160> call<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.520> an<00:05:01.700> A<00:05:01.880> like<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.210> color

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
they call it an A like this color

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.260 
they call it an A like this color
meaning<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.770> colors<00:05:04.100> are<00:05:04.220> right<00:05:04.940> next<00:05:05.120> to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
meaning the colors are right next to

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.980 
meaning the colors are right next to
each<00:05:05.390> other<00:05:05.570> on<00:05:05.840> on<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.710> color<00:05:06.920> wheel<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:08.060> if

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
each other on on the color wheel and if

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.360 
each other on on the color wheel and if
you<00:05:09.110> still<00:05:09.320> wanted<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.650> make<00:05:09.860> something<00:05:10.070> pop

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
you still wanted to make something pop

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.730 
you still wanted to make something pop
up<00:05:10.580> out<00:05:10.760> of<00:05:10.850> all<00:05:11.180> those<00:05:11.330> three<00:05:11.540> colors<00:05:11.870> make<00:05:12.620> an

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
up out of all those three colors make an

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.010 
up out of all those three colors make an
opposite<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.370> either<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.600> three<00:05:14.810> colors

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
opposite of it either the three colors

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.930 
opposite of it either the three colors
next<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.680> two<00:05:16.040> colors<00:05:16.280> next<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.730> red

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
next to the two colors next to the red

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.000 
next to the two colors next to the red
it<00:05:17.180> will<00:05:17.330> make<00:05:17.510> those<00:05:17.750> those<00:05:18.320> color<00:05:18.560> pop<00:05:18.800> pop

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
it will make those those color pop pop

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.740 
it will make those those color pop pop
like<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> eyes<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:20.240> if<00:05:20.360> you're<00:05:20.480> doing

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
like the eyes so if you're doing

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.020 
like the eyes so if you're doing
yellow-green<00:05:21.290> for<00:05:21.500> example<00:05:21.920> you<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.760> always

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
yellow-green for example you can always

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.240 
yellow-green for example you can always
do<00:05:23.210> read<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:24.200> will<00:05:24.380> still<00:05:24.560> pop<00:05:24.740> up<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.160> or

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
do read it will still pop up and or

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.909 
do read it will still pop up and or
whatever<00:05:25.580> next<00:05:25.910> to<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.210> which<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.600> i<00:05:26.810> believe

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
whatever next to it which is i believe

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.930 
whatever next to it which is i believe
the<00:05:27.919> red<00:05:28.669> purple<00:05:28.910> or<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:30.470> blue<00:05:30.830> purple<00:05:31.010> now

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
the red purple or the blue purple now

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.280 
the red purple or the blue purple now
I'm<00:05:32.090> getting<00:05:32.210> lost<00:05:32.480> because<00:05:32.810> there's<00:05:33.050> there's

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
more colors you know to figure it out

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.780 
more colors you know to figure it out
now<00:05:36.350> another<00:05:36.680> tool<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.160> wanted<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.520> show

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
now another tool that I wanted to show

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.840 
now another tool that I wanted to show
is<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:39.020> found<00:05:39.470> this<00:05:39.590> website<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:40.370> actually

is I found this website that actually
gives<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.330> color<00:05:41.600> schemes<00:05:41.990> for<00:05:42.230> websites<00:05:42.830> but

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
gives you color schemes for websites but

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.460 
gives you color schemes for websites but
you<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.340> always<00:05:43.490> imply<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.030> apply<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.050> not

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
you can always imply it apply it not

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.270 
you can always imply it apply it not
imply<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:45.860> apply<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.669> onto<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.950> your<00:05:48.950> painting

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
imply it apply it onto the your painting

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.159 
imply it apply it onto the your painting
scheme<00:05:49.520> so<00:05:49.790> if<00:05:50.000> you're<00:05:50.150> not<00:05:50.270> sure<00:05:50.330> what<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:51.020> do

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
scheme so if you're not sure what to do

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.850 
scheme so if you're not sure what to do
and<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:52.430> basically<00:05:52.940> you<00:05:53.419> click<00:05:53.630> a<00:05:53.990> main<00:05:54.590> color

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
and it basically you click a main color

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.040 
and it basically you click a main color
that<00:05:55.070> you<00:05:55.100> wanted<00:05:55.400> a<00:05:55.490> painted<00:05:55.790> at<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.180> then

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
that you wanted a painted at and then

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.409 
that you wanted a painted at and then
you<00:05:57.169> click<00:05:57.410> on<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.890> top<00:05:58.130> buttons<00:05:58.490> if<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.270> want

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
you click on the top buttons if you want

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.150 
you click on the top buttons if you want
to<00:05:59.480> do<00:05:59.600> secondary<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.560> now<00:06:00.860> I<00:06:00.890> guess

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
to do secondary and now I guess

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.130 
to do secondary and now I guess
whichever<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.850> it<00:06:01.970> shows<00:06:02.360> you<00:06:02.510> what<00:06:02.900> color

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
whichever and it shows you what color

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.510 
whichever and it shows you what color
schemes<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.560> actually<00:06:04.040> works<00:06:04.280> together

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
schemes that actually works together

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.060 
schemes that actually works together
with<00:06:04.760> it<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.180> think<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:06.050> it's<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.560> really<00:06:06.800> really

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
with it I think it it's a really really

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.510 
with it I think it it's a really really
great<00:06:07.340> tool<00:06:08.050> especially<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.800> know<00:06:09.890> if<00:06:10.100> you're

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
great tool especially you know if you're

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.870 
great tool especially you know if you're
doing<00:06:11.510> a<00:06:12.020> new<00:06:12.590> chapter<00:06:12.890> for<00:06:13.100> Space<00:06:13.580> Marines

doing a new chapter for Space Marines

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.990 
doing a new chapter for Space Marines
and<00:06:14.060> you're<00:06:14.210> confused<00:06:14.690> all<00:06:15.350> you<00:06:15.500> gotta<00:06:15.680> do

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
and you're confused all you gotta do

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.760 
and you're confused all you gotta do

obviously click on it check it out and
hopefully<00:06:23.840> it<00:06:24.110> helps<00:06:24.440> because<00:06:24.650> color<00:06:25.280> theory

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
hopefully it helps because color theory

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.970 
hopefully it helps because color theory
is<00:06:25.880> technically<00:06:26.660> everything<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:27.590> were<00:06:27.800> you

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
is technically everything that were you

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.710 
is technically everything that were you
that's<00:06:28.370> what<00:06:28.550> you're<00:06:28.669> doing<00:06:29.060> while<00:06:29.540> you're

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
that's what you're doing while you're

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.840 
that's what you're doing while you're
painting<00:06:30.080> your<00:06:30.380> painting<00:06:31.220> colors<00:06:31.580> onto

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
painting your painting colors onto

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.450 
painting your painting colors onto
models<00:06:32.479> yes<00:06:32.990> they're<00:06:33.260> not<00:06:33.470> flat<00:06:33.919> grounds

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
models yes they're not flat grounds

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.750 
models yes they're not flat grounds
you're<00:06:34.580> not

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
you're not

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.230 
you're not
design<00:06:35.000> posters<00:06:35.540> or<00:06:35.690> anything<00:06:36.110> but<00:06:37.090> Chung<00:06:38.090> is

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
design posters or anything but Chung is

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.510 
design posters or anything but Chung is
right<00:06:38.480> on<00:06:38.660> one<00:06:38.840> thing<00:06:39.080> paint<00:06:39.890> whatever<00:06:40.130> that

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
right on one thing paint whatever that

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.030 
right on one thing paint whatever that
makes<00:06:40.760> it<00:06:40.940> looks<00:06:41.240> good<00:06:41.570> but<00:06:42.290> understanding

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
makes it looks good but understanding

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.640 
makes it looks good but understanding
card<00:06:43.310> theory<00:06:43.820> better<00:06:44.060> I<00:06:44.330> think<00:06:45.080> helps<00:06:45.470> you

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
card theory better I think helps you

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.170 
card theory better I think helps you
create<00:06:46.040> or<00:06:47.410> understand<00:06:48.410> why<00:06:48.920> it<00:06:49.250> looks<00:06:49.520> good<00:06:49.760> I

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
create or understand why it looks good I

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.460 
create or understand why it looks good I
think<00:06:50.840> it's<00:06:50.990> very<00:06:51.050> essential<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:52.630> um<00:06:53.630> I<00:06:53.720> mean

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
think it's very essential and um I mean

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.380 
think it's very essential and um I mean
hopefully<00:06:55.040> this<00:06:55.310> tutorial<00:06:55.490> helps<00:06:56.240> you<00:06:56.360> a

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
hopefully this tutorial helps you a

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.720 
hopefully this tutorial helps you a
little<00:06:56.660> bit<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:57.650> understand<00:06:58.130> about<00:06:58.340> color

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
little bit to understand about color

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.150 
little bit to understand about color
theory<00:06:59.000> I'm<00:06:59.330> just<00:06:59.690> doing<00:07:00.500> the<00:07:00.590> basics<00:07:01.010> of

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
theory I'm just doing the basics of

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.760 
theory I'm just doing the basics of
color<00:07:01.340> theory<00:07:01.760> obviously<00:07:02.750> there's<00:07:03.500> like

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
color theory obviously there's like

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.800 
color theory obviously there's like
classes<00:07:04.340> and<00:07:04.550> classes<00:07:04.760> I<00:07:05.180> mean<00:07:05.420> I<00:07:05.510> have<00:07:05.690> to

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
classes and classes I mean I have to

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.690 
classes and classes I mean I have to
take<00:07:05.990> color<00:07:06.170> theory<00:07:06.530> for<00:07:06.680> over<00:07:06.890> a<00:07:06.920> year<00:07:07.010> to

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
take color theory for over a year to

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.690 
take color theory for over a year to
actually<00:07:07.850> fully<00:07:08.330> understand<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:08.960> but<00:07:09.620> keep<00:07:10.580> in

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
actually fully understand it but keep in

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.070 
actually fully understand it but keep in
mind<00:07:10.730> you<00:07:11.120> know<00:07:11.240> if<00:07:11.360> it<00:07:11.480> looks<00:07:11.660> good<00:07:11.750> in<00:07:11.960> your

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
mind you know if it looks good in your

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.010 
mind you know if it looks good in your
eyes<00:07:12.230> it<00:07:12.500> looks<00:07:12.680> good<00:07:12.950> but<00:07:13.850> color<00:07:14.720> theory

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
eyes it looks good but color theory

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.960 
eyes it looks good but color theory
enhances<00:07:15.800> the<00:07:16.310> i<00:07:17.000> guess<00:07:17.660> the<00:07:17.690> theory<00:07:18.230> like<00:07:18.470> why

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
enhances the i guess the theory like why

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.700 
enhances the i guess the theory like why
why<00:07:19.970> does<00:07:20.150> it<00:07:20.270> look<00:07:20.390> good<00:07:20.600> how<00:07:21.260> can<00:07:21.500> i<00:07:21.590> achieve

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
why does it look good how can i achieve

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.220 
why does it look good how can i achieve
this<00:07:22.040> again<00:07:22.400> on<00:07:22.550> other<00:07:22.790> models<00:07:23.270> so<00:07:23.870> hopefully

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
this again on other models so hopefully

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.260 
this again on other models so hopefully
you<00:07:24.320> would<00:07:24.410> understand<00:07:24.890> it<00:07:25.040> but<00:07:25.250> what<00:07:26.120> do<00:07:26.210> you

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
you would understand it but what do you

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.520 
you would understand it but what do you
guys<00:07:26.390> think<00:07:26.450> I<00:07:26.840> want<00:07:27.110> to<00:07:27.170> know<00:07:27.260> what<00:07:27.410> you<00:07:27.500> guys

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
guys think I want to know what you guys

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.560 
guys think I want to know what you guys
think<00:07:27.860> do<00:07:28.040> you<00:07:28.070> think<00:07:28.160> code<00:07:29.150> theory<00:07:29.450> is

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
think do you think code theory is

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.940 
think do you think code theory is
important<00:07:30.050> when<00:07:30.560> you're<00:07:30.650> painting<00:07:30.860> your

important when you're painting your

important when you're painting your
models<00:07:31.370> do<00:07:31.520> you<00:07:31.610> think<00:07:31.910> it's<00:07:32.720> just<00:07:32.840> like<00:07:33.110> you

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
models do you think it's just like you

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.340 
models do you think it's just like you
know<00:07:33.380> whatever's<00:07:33.860> it's<00:07:34.340> it's<00:07:35.300> too<00:07:35.570> much<00:07:35.870> stuff

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.350 
know whatever's it's it's too much stuff

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.310 
know whatever's it's it's too much stuff
