absolutely<00:00:20.880> killing<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.329> pretty<00:00:22.200> much<00:00:22.349> land

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
absolutely killing it pretty much land

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
absolutely killing it pretty much land
any<00:00:22.860> trick<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.579> of<00:00:23.669> it<00:00:23.970> off<00:00:24.239> a<00:00:24.300> jump

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
any trick you can think of it off a jump

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.300 
any trick you can think of it off a jump
and<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.259> steering's<00:00:25.649> coming<00:00:25.950> along<00:00:26.099> quite

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and the steering's coming along quite

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
and the steering's coming along quite
nicely<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.820> well<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.930> that's<00:00:28.200> why<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.649> him

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
nicely as well so that's why we got him

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
nicely as well so that's why we got him
in<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> he's<00:00:29.399> gonna<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.759> performing<00:00:30.329> a<00:00:30.390> nice

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in and he's gonna be performing a nice

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.570 
in and he's gonna be performing a nice
tail<00:00:31.079> slide<00:00:31.739> to<00:00:32.160> seven<00:00:32.460> years

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.850 

tailed<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.450> serve<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:37.930> good<00:00:38.200> fun<00:00:38.440> trick<00:00:38.710> it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
tailed to serve is a good fun trick it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.560 
tailed to serve is a good fun trick it
was<00:00:38.920> actually<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.370> first<00:00:39.580> intermediate<00:00:40.150> jib

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
was actually the first intermediate jib

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.510 
was actually the first intermediate jib
trick<00:00:40.810> that<00:00:40.960> I<00:00:41.050> did<00:00:41.260> learn<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:42.190> once<00:00:42.370> you're

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
trick that I did learn so once you're

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.220 
trick that I did learn so once you're
comfortable<00:00:42.850> with<00:00:42.940> boxes<00:00:43.330> and<00:00:43.450> rails<00:00:43.480> it's

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
comfortable with boxes and rails it's

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.870 
comfortable with boxes and rails it's
actually<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.560> good<00:00:44.770> next<00:00:45.100> step<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.430> take<00:00:45.580> you<00:00:45.730> to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
actually a good next step to take you to

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.160 
actually a good next step to take you to
them

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.290 

approach<00:00:51.800> on<00:00:52.010> your<00:00:52.130> heel<00:00:52.340> edge<00:00:52.520> carving<00:00:53.150> a

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
approach on your heel edge carving a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.360 
approach on your heel edge carving a
slight<00:00:53.630> arc<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.650> initiate<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.100> nice

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
slight arc this is to initiate a nice

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.670 
slight arc this is to initiate a nice
smooth<00:00:55.700> frontside<00:00:56.210> spirit<00:00:56.660> this<00:00:57.380> arc

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
smooth frontside spirit this arc

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.320 
smooth frontside spirit this arc
sometimes<00:00:58.190> makes<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.580> difficult<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.150> lock

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
sometimes makes it difficult to lock

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.180 
sometimes makes it difficult to lock
onto<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.690> rail<00:00:59.870> in<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.110> straight<00:01:00.410> line<00:01:00.650> so<00:01:00.920> it's

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
onto the rail in a straight line so it's

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.620 
onto the rail in a straight line so it's
best<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.490> learn<00:01:01.700> on<00:01:01.910> something<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.270> little<00:01:02.510> bit

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
best to learn on something a little bit

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.530 
best to learn on something a little bit
wider<00:01:02.870> say<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.740> box<00:01:04.040> but<00:01:04.820> because<00:01:05.150> Mike<00:01:05.360> he

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
wider say a box but because Mike he

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.030 
wider say a box but because Mike he
kills<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.110> much<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.560> thought<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.860> would<00:01:06.920> be

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
kills it so much we thought it would be

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.780 
kills it so much we thought it would be
best<00:01:07.220> if<00:01:07.340> he<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.550> go<00:01:07.700> around<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:10.490> trick

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
best if he to go around this trick

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.580 
best if he to go around this trick
requires<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.270> good<00:01:11.479> amount<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.870> frontside<00:01:12.229> spin

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
requires a good amount of frontside spin

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.590 
requires a good amount of frontside spin
so<00:01:12.979> as<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.280> approach<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.910> take-off<00:01:14.270> wind

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
so as you approach to the take-off wind

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.300 
so as you approach to the take-off wind
up<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.960> pops<00:01:15.170> straight<00:01:15.500> into<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> quarter

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
up and pops straight into a quarter

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.260 
up and pops straight into a quarter

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.620 
since the trick start of the tailslide
you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> lock<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> rail<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.509> as
