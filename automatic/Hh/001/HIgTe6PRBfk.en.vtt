00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.620
 in the block 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.680
 sexy we can have a new block or one 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.980
 widgets in the column or in one of the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.990
 place a column 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.939
 The difference between these two is that one 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.930
 block does not contain any information yet 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.119
 widget 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 if we want a new block 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 places we click on a new block 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 a new empty block is placed in the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.230
 we can easily change the title 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.770
 sir very original 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.350
 We can test and content this block 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.589

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.039
 image text left 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.039
 and so on 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.159
 I'm just going back to layout 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.540
 at a fidget we have more control over the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.580
 position of this is put down 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.020
 for example, I want one 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.490
 search widget places now I can choose 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.990
 where i want him, but here the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.720
 in the middle and there is a ready-made one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.650
 search widget 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 posted that I take one away then I go 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:50.080
 over the blocks and click on delete 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.910
 block and seen again or possibly 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.320
 possible to go above or below the content 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:04.380

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.380
