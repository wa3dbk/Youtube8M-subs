excuse<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:20.120> got<00:03:20.360> lazy<00:03:20.540> I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
excuse I have is that I just got lazy I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.740 
excuse I have is that I just got lazy I
could<00:03:21.019> not<00:03:21.140> be<00:03:21.290> positive<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.760> took<00:03:23.060> quite<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
could not be positive it took quite a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.050 
could not be positive it took quite a
while<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.190> thought<00:03:25.459> I'd<00:03:25.519> do

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
while to do it so I just thought I'd do

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:35.240 
while to do it so I just thought I'd do
it<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.870> way

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.470 

as<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.550> see<00:03:36.730> i<00:03:36.760> use<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.150> exact<00:03:37.450> same

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
as you can see i use the exact same

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.480 
as you can see i use the exact same
principle<00:03:38.110> if<00:03:38.200> i<00:03:38.319> wanted<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> change<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.250> color

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
principle if i wanted to change a color

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.490 
principle if i wanted to change a color
i<00:03:39.700> made<00:03:40.000> sure<00:03:40.030> they<00:03:40.330> painted<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.810> white<00:03:41.080> first

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
i made sure they painted it white first

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.580 
i made sure they painted it white first
because<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.090> otherwise<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.260> colors

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
because that just otherwise the colors

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.340 
because that just otherwise the colors
can<00:03:44.770> blend<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.360> colors<00:03:46.720> won't<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.170> as

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
can blend and the colors won't be as

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.490 
can blend and the colors won't be as
bright<00:03:51.240> for<00:03:52.240> instance<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.780> very<00:03:52.930> tops<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.350> his

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
bright for instance the very tops of his

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.320 
bright for instance the very tops of his
eyes<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.890> wanted<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.310> be<00:03:54.459> blue<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.090> why<00:03:55.300> I

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
eyes I wanted to be blue so that's why I

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.030 
eyes I wanted to be blue so that's why I
painted<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.900> white<00:03:56.110> first<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.709> then<00:03:56.830> come

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
painted it white first and then come

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.650 
painted it white first and then come
back<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.400> with<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.640> blue<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.150> blue<00:03:58.360> will<00:03:58.540> be

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
back in with the blue the blue will be

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:08.790 
back in with the blue the blue will be
really<00:03:58.959> really<00:03:59.080> bright

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.050 

exactly<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.950> same<00:04:10.160> thing<00:04:10.400> proceeds<00:04:10.820> pink

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
exactly the same thing proceeds pink

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.090 
exactly the same thing proceeds pink
nose<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.630> wanted<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.320> be<00:04:12.380> really<00:04:12.560> bright<00:04:12.830> so

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.800 
nose I wanted it to be really bright so
I'm<00:04:13.220> painted<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.760> white<00:04:13.940> first<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:14.630> went

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
I'm painted it white first and then went

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:43.570 
I'm painted it white first and then went
back<00:04:14.870> over<00:04:15.050> with<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.650> pink

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.830

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
the middle of its face and I couldn't be

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.560 
the middle of its face and I couldn't be
bothered<00:04:50.370> painting<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.090> probably<00:04:51.240> could've

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
bothered painting it I probably could've

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.170 
bothered painting it I probably could've
but<00:04:52.140> what<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.530> wanted<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.800> do<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.220> show<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.520> how

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180

but what I wanted to do is show you how
I<00:04:54.210> use<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.050> other<00:04:55.200> end<00:04:55.470> of<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.830> really<00:04:56.130> a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
I use the other end of a really a

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.520 
I use the other end of a really a
paintbrush<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:57.420> not<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> big<00:04:57.840> paintbrush<00:04:58.290> but

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
paintbrush it's not a big paintbrush but

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.710 
paintbrush it's not a big paintbrush but
the<00:04:58.620> other<00:04:58.800> end<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.310> is<00:04:59.520> huge<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.270> it's

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
the other end of it is huge and it's

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.720 
the other end of it is huge and it's
much<00:05:01.050> bigger<00:05:01.350> than<00:05:01.470> my<00:05:01.740> biggest<00:05:02.160> dotting<00:05:02.550> tool

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
much bigger than my biggest dotting tool

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.420 
much bigger than my biggest dotting tool
