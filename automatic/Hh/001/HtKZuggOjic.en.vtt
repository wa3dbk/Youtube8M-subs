this is how to do this basically on our
Android<00:00:36.180> phone<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:37.020> older<00:00:37.350> phones<00:00:38.059> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
Android phone some older phones you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
Android phone some older phones you
couldn't<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:41.809> because<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:42.930> didn't<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
couldn't do because they didn't have the

couldn't do because they didn't have the
functionality<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.140> may

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
functionality to just do it and you may

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
functionality to just do it and you may
have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> contact<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:47.039> network<00:00:47.520> provider<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
do it but on Android phones basically

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.330 
do it but on Android phones basically
all<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> call<00:00:52.920> feature<00:00:53.129> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
all you do is so the the call feature is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
all you do is so the the call feature is
called<00:00:53.489> call<00:00:53.820> rejection<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
called call rejection so what you do is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.420 
called call rejection so what you do is
from<00:00:55.920> applications<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.590> settings<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.920> go

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
from applications go to settings and go

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
from applications go to settings and go
to<00:00:59.460> call<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> top

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to call and you can see at the top

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.319 
to call and you can see at the top
you've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.590> call<00:01:01.920> rejection<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you've got call rejection there that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
you've got call rejection there that
needs<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:04.949> default<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.580> turned

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
needs to be on by default it's turned

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.620 
needs to be on by default it's turned
off<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.100> usually<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.490> off<00:01:08.670> mode<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
off so usually it's on that off mode you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.700 
off so usually it's on that off mode you
can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> says<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> reject<00:01:10.799> mode<00:01:10.979> off

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
can see it says all to reject mode off

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.600 
can see it says all to reject mode off
what<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> need<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:15.770> tap<00:01:16.770> auto<00:01:17.009> reject

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
what you need to do is tap auto reject

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
what you need to do is tap auto reject
mode<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.810> gives<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> options<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.680> for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mode and it gives you options there for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
mode and it gives you options there for
off<00:01:20.009> all<00:01:20.610> numbers<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.450> blacklist

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
off all numbers on your blacklist

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.340 
off all numbers on your blacklist
obviously<00:01:23.009> off<00:01:23.220> doesn't<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:23.850> anything<00:01:24.350> you're

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
obviously off doesn't do anything you're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
obviously off doesn't do anything you're
not<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.950> call<00:01:26.100> rejection<00:01:26.369> feature<00:01:26.790> all
