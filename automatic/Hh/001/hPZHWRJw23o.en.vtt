00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
the workbench workbench put this in
position<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> make

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
position and then I just have to make

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:38.660 
position and then I just have to make
sure<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:28.549> press<00:01:29.549> deep<00:01:30.090> enough<00:01:33.170> you'll<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:37.670> and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.050 
sure I press deep enough you'll see and
the<00:01:39.090> retainers<00:01:39.860> coming<00:01:40.860> loose<00:01:41.040> inside<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the retainers coming loose inside and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.960 
the retainers coming loose inside and
then<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> magnets<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:45.060> will<00:01:45.329> come<00:01:45.479> out

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
then with the magnets it will come out

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.810 
then with the magnets it will come out
difficult<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> show<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:50.340> here's<00:01:50.579> ready

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
difficult to show you what here's ready

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
difficult to show you what here's ready
one<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> has<00:01:51.390> been<00:01:51.570> removed<00:01:52.430> together<00:01:53.430> with

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

taking<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.710> by<00:01:58.890> one

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
taking out one by one

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.080 
taking out one by one
and<00:01:59.820> then<00:02:00.630> hope<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.530> find<00:02:01.850> which<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.060> are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and then hope I can find which one are

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.690 
and then hope I can find which one are
the<00:02:03.329> sticky<00:02:03.630> force

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the sticky force

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.400 
the sticky force
this<00:02:05.700> one<00:02:05.880> seems<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.390> quite<00:02:06.570> loose<00:02:06.810> going

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
this one seems to be quite loose going

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.820 
this one seems to be quite loose going
up<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:07.770> freely<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.619> one

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
up and down freely but I know this one

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.940 
up and down freely but I know this one
is<00:02:11.040> a<00:02:11.070> sticky<00:02:11.490> one<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.540> will<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.900> why<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.740> is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
is a sticky one so we will see why it is

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.420 
is a sticky one so we will see why it is
so<00:02:14.100> sticky<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.790> hope<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:16.260> bent<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.860> we'll

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
so sticky I hope it's not bent but we'll

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
so sticky I hope it's not bent but we'll
try<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> find<00:02:17.880> out
