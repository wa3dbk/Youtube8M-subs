00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.879
 a tomato square the yellow variety to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.500
 stuffing is produced at the conservatory of 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.199
 the tomato of the bourdaisière castle 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.859
 the chief gardener nicolas toutain 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.610
 we have these features 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.160
 that's a variety 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.050
 what is original in the form of peppers 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.090
 as may be others 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.770
 varieties but we still have not 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.690
 many of these among this 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.250
 collection of tomatoes really shaped it 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.020
 peppers hollow like peppers 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.150
 therefore as indicated 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 I do not feel yellow to stuff it's a 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.010
 tomato that is great for stuffing it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.059
 is really hollow with anna no juice 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.470
 at all 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.870
 it's a pretty firm load that goes well 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.190
 supported cooking and so it'll do 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.670
 a stuffed tomato that does not burst at 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.570
 the cooking 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.500
 so that's still enough 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.270
 appreciable after so this tomato 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.060
 yellow to stuff it's really for 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.010
 stuffing in salad it will not have so much 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.550
 of interest because that's the flesh is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 still a little thick and juicy 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.930
 so it's really for to accommodate 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.790
 stuffing in culture so 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.759
 it's a tomato that would be more of a mi 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.899
 season and after we see that it's a 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.770
 plant that has growth anyway 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.750
 quite vigorous 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.729
 so he can do who can do a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.740
 meter eighty quite easily and 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.270
 which is very easily cultivated this one 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.600
 there is no problem for this 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.820
 variety stuffing yellow stands well 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.740
 standing in a laurence jacchus dish 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.140
