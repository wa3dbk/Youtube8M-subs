00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
in that area if you go too fast you hit

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.230 
in that area if you go too fast you hit
the<00:01:54.030> top<00:01:54.240> shot<00:01:54.450> again<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> get<00:01:57.000> past

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the top shot again so just to get past

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.830 
the top shot again so just to get past
this<00:01:57.420> part<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> slow<00:01:58.229> down<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:59.840> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this part with the slow down here so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.639 
this part with the slow down here so
that's<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:02.159> careful<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> hammer<00:02:02.820> there

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
that's that be careful the hammer there

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.260 
that's that be careful the hammer there
so<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.710> got<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.700> got<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.090> down<00:02:06.240> here

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so we got and we got still down here

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.050 
so we got and we got still down here

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
checkpoint so if you are able to collect

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.720 
checkpoint so if you are able to collect
all<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> stars<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.760> game<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.030> get<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.209> bonus

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
all the stars and game you get a bonus

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.520 
all the stars and game you get a bonus
so<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.819> do<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.030> little<00:02:26.390> stunt<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
so we do a little stunt and that's a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.210 
so we do a little stunt and that's a
forward<00:02:27.830> flip<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:29.000> landed<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.099> each

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
forward flip and we landed it so in each

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.720 
forward flip and we landed it so in each
game<00:02:31.459> they<00:02:31.700> want<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.150> do<00:02:33.310> maximum<00:02:34.310> four

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
game they want you to do maximum four

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.850 
game they want you to do maximum four
different<00:02:35.569> tricks<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.019> get<00:02:36.170> points<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.739> we

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
different tricks to get points and we

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.140 
different tricks to get points and we
all<00:02:36.980> needed<00:02:37.250> one<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.670> forward<00:02:38.060> flip<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
all needed one the forward flip and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.520 
all needed one the forward flip and
there<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.180> couple<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.510> bonuses<00:02:41.780> at<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> end<00:02:42.260> and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
there a couple of bonuses at the end and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.199 
there a couple of bonuses at the end and
that's<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> total<00:02:43.040> score<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:46.280> was<00:02:46.700> you

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
that's the total score so that was you

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.819 
that's the total score so that was you
know<00:02:47.299> one<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> earliest<00:02:47.930> levels<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.709> what

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
know one of the earliest levels and what

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.940 
know one of the earliest levels and what
we'll<00:02:48.980> do<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:50.150> show<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.170> one<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.739> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
we'll do now is to show you one of the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.750 
we'll do now is to show you one of the
harder<00:02:52.630> levels<00:02:53.829> that<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:54.890> might<00:02:55.190> see<00:02:55.489> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
harder levels that you might see and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.270 
harder levels that you might see and
this<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.390> second<00:02:56.780> cup<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.799> final<00:02:58.130> level

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
this is the second cup the final level

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.640 
this is the second cup the final level
in<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:58.640> cup<00:03:00.940> same<00:03:01.940> controls<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.660> we'll<00:03:02.840> start

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in that cup same controls so we'll start

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.199 
in that cup same controls so we'll start
and<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.489> requires<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.849> little<00:03:04.970> bit<00:03:05.090> of

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
and this one requires a little bit of

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.920 
and this one requires a little bit of
patience<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:06.470> stop<00:03:06.680> from<00:03:06.860> time<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.190> time

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
patience to stop from time to time

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.160 
patience to stop from time to time
because<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.260> these<00:03:09.349> objects<00:03:10.310> here<00:03:11.170> nice

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
because of these objects here nice

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.979 
because of these objects here nice
little<00:03:12.500> platform<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:16.720> green<00:03:17.720> things

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
little platform and the green things

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.860 
little platform and the green things
here<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.319> speed<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:20.299> part<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.600> pretty

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
here is speed you up this part is pretty

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.059 
here is speed you up this part is pretty
cool<00:03:21.049> because<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.440> kind<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.680> like<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.829> roller

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
cool because it's kind of like a roller

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.979 
cool because it's kind of like a roller
coaster<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:25.579> got<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.819> lot<00:03:26.269> of<00:03:26.299> air<00:03:26.780> right

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
coaster and we got a lot of air right

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.190 
coaster and we got a lot of air right
there<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.530> did<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> nice<00:03:27.920> forward<00:03:28.579> spin<00:03:30.880> and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
there so did a nice forward spin and

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.690 
there so did a nice forward spin and
we've<00:03:33.200> got<00:03:33.319> another<00:03:33.560> platform<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.400> let's<00:03:34.549> try

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
we've got another platform so let's try

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.500 
we've got another platform so let's try
backwards<00:03:35.480> spin<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:36.109> time<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:38.359> we'll

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
backwards spin this time and so we'll

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.819 
backwards spin this time and so we'll
try<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.780> again<00:03:40.870> gotta<00:03:41.870> be<00:03:41.989> patient<00:03:42.139> in<00:03:42.560> this

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
try that again gotta be patient in this

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:53.449 
try that again gotta be patient in this
area<00:03:46.660> okay<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.019> we<00:03:48.139> clear<00:03:48.500> that

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.039 

and<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:55.599> green<00:03:55.840> part<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:56.200> always<00:03:56.319> pretty<00:03:56.590> fun

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.580 

so<00:04:02.049> let's<00:04:02.109> do<00:04:02.439> a<00:04:02.469> front<00:04:03.219> flip<00:04:03.430> there<00:04:04.409> now<00:04:05.409> make

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
so let's do a front flip there now make

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.990 
so let's do a front flip there now make
sure<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.769> land<00:04:06.129> flat<00:04:06.790> or<00:04:07.239> else<00:04:07.620> scheme<00:04:08.620> over

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
sure you land flat or else scheme over

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.890 
sure you land flat or else scheme over
so<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.090> time<00:04:10.120> we'll<00:04:10.420> do<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.569> black<00:04:11.280> flip<00:04:12.900> there

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
so this time we'll do a black flip there

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.650 
so this time we'll do a black flip there
you<00:04:14.079> go<00:04:14.230> yeah<00:04:14.769> for<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.549> little<00:04:16.150> spinning<00:04:16.509> wheel

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
you go yeah for a little spinning wheel

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.479 
you go yeah for a little spinning wheel
acquires<00:04:17.199> hitting<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.650> once<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:18.039> break<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
acquires hitting it once to break it and

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.890 
acquires hitting it once to break it and
then<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.759> second<00:04:19.090> time<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.329> can<00:04:19.449> actually<00:04:19.750> go

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
then the second time you can actually go

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.210 
then the second time you can actually go
through<00:04:19.979> let's<00:04:20.979> do<00:04:21.160> another<00:04:21.280> one<00:04:21.639> right<00:04:22.479> here

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
through let's do another one right here

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.960 
through let's do another one right here
and<00:04:24.220> that's<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.570> end<00:04:25.660> of<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> level<00:04:26.580> so<00:04:27.580> the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
and that's the end of the level so the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.710 
and that's the end of the level so the
graphics<00:04:28.330> are<00:04:28.419> incredible<00:04:30.270> sound<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.509> good

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
graphics are incredible sound is good

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.180 
graphics are incredible sound is good
and<00:04:31.900> we've<00:04:32.050> managed<00:04:32.380> two<00:04:32.560> out<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.740> four<00:04:32.979> tricks

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
and we've managed two out of four tricks

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.610 
and we've managed two out of four tricks
so<00:04:33.400> that's<00:04:33.550> not<00:04:33.639> too<00:04:33.820> bad<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:35.080> we<00:04:35.229> did<00:04:35.410> get

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
so that's not too bad and we did get

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.499 
so that's not too bad and we did get
that<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.280> first<00:04:36.490> try<00:04:36.849> and<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.330> get<00:04:37.479> a

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
that and the first try and you get a

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.010 
that and the first try and you get a
bonus<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.990> result<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:40.030> it's<00:04:40.360> not<00:04:40.509> bad<00:04:40.780> at<00:04:40.900> all

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
bonus the result so it's not bad at all

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.920 
bonus the result so it's not bad at all
and<00:04:41.320> at<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.340> end<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.490> each<00:04:42.610> cup<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.720> get<00:04:43.900> a

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
and at the end of each cup you get a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.810 
and at the end of each cup you get a
trophy<00:04:44.789> and<00:04:46.289> this<00:04:47.289> gets<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:48.039> course<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.550> gets

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
trophy and this gets of course it gets

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.719 
trophy and this gets of course it gets
pushed<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.870> score<00:04:50.110> loop<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:51.580> can

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
pushed on to score loop so that you can

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.930
