one we're looking for is our network

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.580 
one we're looking for is our network
that<00:01:39.210> we've<00:01:39.360> set<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.570> called<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.140> connected

that we've set up called get connected

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.700 
that we've set up called get connected
if<00:01:40.770> you've<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:40.979> security<00:01:41.700> setup<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.390> your

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
if you've got security setup on your

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.109 
if you've got security setup on your
network<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> office<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> should

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
network in the office which you should

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
network in the office which you should
have<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.409> you're<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
have then here you're going to have to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.319 
have then here you're going to have to
enter<00:01:47.220> your<00:01:47.340> code<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> I'm<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.149> put

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
enter your code in and I'm going to put

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
enter your code in and I'm going to put
that<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that in here I think that's the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.460 
that in here I think that's the
important<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:51.060> AJ<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
important thing as well AJ that the the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
important thing as well AJ that the the
security<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.009> actually<00:01:53.340> quite<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:53.579> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
security is actually quite good just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.460 
security is actually quite good just
like<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> secure<00:01:54.750> connection<00:01:55.049> once

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like you have a secure connection once

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
like you have a secure connection once
you've<00:01:55.619> set<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.250> router<00:01:56.460> with

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you've set that up on your router with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
you've set that up on your router with
your<00:01:57.180> laptops<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> same<00:01:58.649> type<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
your laptops you have that same type of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.520 
your laptops you have that same type of
security<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.329> HP<00:02:00.479> printer<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.290> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
security with the HP printer as well so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
security with the HP printer as well so
when<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.159> sending<00:02:02.520> documents<00:02:02.759> they're

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
when you are sending documents they're

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.370 
when you are sending documents they're
not<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> flying<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.200> space

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
not just gonna be flying out to space

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.170 
not just gonna be flying out to space
where<00:02:04.829> anyone<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:06.000> going

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
where anyone can get them they're going

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.029 
where anyone can get them they're going
securely<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.020> encrypted<00:02:07.560> right<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
securely and encrypted right to the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.859 
securely and encrypted right to the
printer<00:02:08.369> itself<00:02:08.459> absolutely<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.690> what

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
printer itself absolutely so now what

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.969 
printer itself absolutely so now what
I've<00:02:09.959> done<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.229> I've<00:02:10.319> entered<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.860> our

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
I've done is I've entered in our

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.870 
I've done is I've entered in our
passcode<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> passkey<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
passcode or a passkey and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.760 
passcode or a passkey and
the<00:02:13.030> printer<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.750> connected<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.560> Network

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the printer is connected to that Network

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
the printer is connected to that Network
so<00:02:15.100> that's<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:16.030> only<00:02:16.300> reason<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.720> we

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
so that's it the only reason that we

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.570 
so that's it the only reason that we
need<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.320> tethered<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.800> anything<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.340> for

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
need to be tethered to anything is for

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
need to be tethered to anything is for
power<00:02:18.790> they<00:02:19.270> haven't<00:02:19.420> quite<00:02:19.630> figured<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:20.020> how

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
power they haven't quite figured out how

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.140 
power they haven't quite figured out how
to<00:02:20.260> send<00:02:20.470> power<00:02:20.650> wirelessly<00:02:21.280> yet<00:02:21.640> i'm<00:02:22.000> waiting

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to send power wirelessly yet i'm waiting

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.030 
to send power wirelessly yet i'm waiting
for<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.690> day<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> nice<00:02:23.560> thing<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.800> is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
office environment as well you don't

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.790 
office environment as well you don't
have<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.050> your<00:02:38.170> office<00:02:38.350> anymore

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
most sense to have that printer located

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.220 
most sense to have that printer located
so<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.910> next<00:02:45.940> step<00:02:46.240> after<00:02:46.480> we've<00:02:46.750> set<00:02:46.990> up<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
so the next step after we've set up the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.350 
so the next step after we've set up the
wireless<00:02:47.440> aspect<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.460> it's<00:02:48.760> connected<00:02:49.240> with

literally<00:03:07.450> anywhere<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.740> office<00:03:09.040> which

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
literally anywhere in the office which

literally anywhere in the office which
is<00:03:09.310> kind<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.610> nice<00:03:09.760> feature<00:03:09.790> exactly<00:03:10.690> i

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
is kind of a nice feature exactly i

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.180 
is kind of a nice feature exactly i
think<00:03:10.960> about<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.290> for<00:03:11.470> your<00:03:11.620> employees<00:03:11.830> that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
think about this for your employees that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.920 
think about this for your employees that
might<00:03:12.250> be<00:03:12.490> on<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.760> road<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.210> that<00:03:13.570> now<00:03:13.720> they

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
might be on the road is that now they

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.300 
might be on the road is that now they
can<00:03:14.110> actually<00:03:14.380> be<00:03:14.500> Road<00:03:14.710> wires<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.160> come

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
can actually be Road wires that come

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.830 
can actually be Road wires that come
into<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.640> office<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.000> simply<00:03:16.420> connect<00:03:16.720> to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
into the office and simply connect to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.390 
into the office and simply connect to
that<00:03:16.930> wireless<00:03:17.320> printer<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.250> actually

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that wireless printer and it actually

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.880 
that wireless printer and it actually
saves<00:03:18.700> money<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.210> well<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:20.140> I've<00:03:20.320> got<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> web

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
saves money as well so I've got a web

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.680 
saves money as well so I've got a web
page<00:03:21.100> here<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:21.610> want<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:22.000> print<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.480> and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
page here that I want to print out and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.480 
page here that I want to print out and
again<00:03:22.930> I'm<00:03:23.110> wirelessly<00:03:23.710> connected<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.280> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
again I'm wirelessly connected to the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.180 
again I'm wirelessly connected to the
the<00:03:24.820> printer<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.870> just<00:03:26.050> simply<00:03:26.260> hit<00:03:26.590> print

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
the printer and I just simply hit print

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.890 
the printer and I just simply hit print
I<00:03:27.430> select<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.720> officejet<00:03:29.200> pro<00:03:29.440> 8500<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
I select the officejet pro 8500 and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.690 
I select the officejet pro 8500 and
presto<00:03:31.900> cos<00:03:32.080> Inga<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.560> mean<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.130> fast<00:03:33.520> as

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
presto cos Inga I mean is that fast as

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.370 
presto cos Inga I mean is that fast as
printing<00:03:34.030> right<00:03:34.180> now<00:03:34.300> as<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.020> printing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
printing right now as this is printing

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.380 
printing right now as this is printing
out<00:03:35.470> here<00:03:35.770> another<00:03:36.370> reason<00:03:36.790> for<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> cost

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
out here another reason for the cost

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.850 
out here another reason for the cost
savings<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.960> that<00:03:38.140> if<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.560> can<00:03:38.710> have

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
savings is that if you can have

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.410 
savings is that if you can have
everybody<00:03:39.340> connected<00:03:39.700> through<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.210> network

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
everybody connected through the network

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.270 
everybody connected through the network
to<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> printer<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.590> means<00:03:41.800> that<00:03:41.890> everyone

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
to a printer it means that everyone

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.890 
to a printer it means that everyone
doesn't<00:03:42.610> need<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.000> have<00:03:43.209> their<00:03:43.390> own<00:03:43.420> printer

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
doesn't need to have their own printer

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.180 
doesn't need to have their own printer
on<00:03:44.020> their<00:03:44.170> desk<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:44.590> that's<00:03:44.770> another<00:03:44.980> great

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
on their desk so that's another great

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.610 
on their desk so that's another great
feature<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:46.060> again<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.780> know<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.080> mobility

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
feature but again you know the mobility

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.260 
feature but again you know the mobility
factor<00:03:48.010> I<00:03:48.040> think<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> huge<00:03:48.550> one<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.090> fact

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
factor I think is a huge one the fact

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.850 
factor I think is a huge one the fact
that<00:03:49.390> Mike<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.630> able<00:03:50.020> to<00:03:50.140> go<00:03:50.260> into<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.500> different

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
that Mike is able to go into a different

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.990 
that Mike is able to go into a different
room<00:03:51.040> or<00:03:51.400> really<00:03:51.700> print<00:03:51.970> any<00:03:52.090> one<00:03:52.240> house

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.920 

the<00:03:58.000> nice<00:03:58.150> thing<00:03:58.180> about<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:58.630> particular

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the nice thing about this particular

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.930 
the nice thing about this particular
printer<00:03:59.470> or<00:03:59.740> should<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.010> say<00:04:00.040> all-in-one<00:04:00.730> that

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
printer or should I say all-in-one that

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.400 
printer or should I say all-in-one that
it<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.300> an<00:04:01.450> all-in-one<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.900> has<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.050> built-in

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it is an all-in-one it has a built-in

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.980 
it is an all-in-one it has a built-in
scanner<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:03.070> memory<00:04:03.640> card<00:04:03.880> slot<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.210> I<00:04:04.660> can

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
scanner and memory card slot so I can

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.620 
scanner and memory card slot so I can
also<00:04:05.170> have<00:04:05.620> AJ<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.280> example<00:04:06.790> scan<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:07.420> a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
also have AJ for example scan in a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.230 
also have AJ for example scan in a
contract<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.830> have<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.280> beamed<00:04:09.550> wirelessly

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
contract and have it beamed wirelessly

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.090 
contract and have it beamed wirelessly
over<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.720> my<00:04:10.870> laptop<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.500> I'll<00:04:11.620> do<00:04:11.740> that<00:04:11.890> right

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
over to my laptop so I'll do that right

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070 
over to my laptop so I'll do that right
now<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.640> I've<00:04:12.880> got<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> couple<00:04:13.270> of<00:04:13.450> options<00:04:13.660> for

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
now and I've got a couple of options for

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.660 
now and I've got a couple of options for
scanning<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.650> fits<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.980> book<00:04:15.190> or<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> magazine

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
scanning it I fits a book or a magazine

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.940 
scanning it I fits a book or a magazine
that<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.270> put<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:16.540> just<00:04:16.750> flat<00:04:16.989> down<00:04:17.230> or<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.680> can

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
that can put it just flat down or I can

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.100 
that can put it just flat down or I can
use<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.250> sheet<00:04:18.489> feeder<00:04:18.760> because<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.360> day<00:04:20.050> to

to go into the scan menu and now I've
got<00:04:25.690> some<00:04:25.900> choices<00:04:26.170> here<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.830> can<00:04:27.190> scan<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.580> to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
got some choices here I can scan it to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000 
got some choices here I can scan it to
memory<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.570> can<00:04:28.840> scan<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.170> and<00:04:29.320> push<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.980> a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
memory I can scan it and push it to a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.650 
memory I can scan it and push it to a
computer<00:04:30.400> that's<00:04:30.670> what<00:04:30.850> I'm<00:04:30.970> going<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.150> do<00:04:31.330> but

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
computer that's what I'm going to do but

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.660 
computer that's what I'm going to do but
I<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.930> even<00:04:32.020> scan<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.710> a<00:04:32.740> device<00:04:33.190> here<00:04:33.520> so

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
I can even scan it to a device here so

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.640 
I can even scan it to a device here so
if<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.850> was<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.060> put<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> flash<00:04:34.780> memory<00:04:35.020> card<00:04:35.440> or

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
if I was to put a flash memory card or

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.220 
if I was to put a flash memory card or
an<00:04:35.740> SD<00:04:36.040> card<00:04:36.070> inside<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:37.150> component<00:04:37.960> here

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
an SD card inside of the component here

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.660 
an SD card inside of the component here
I<00:04:38.410> can<00:04:38.800> simply<00:04:39.070> scan<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.370> right<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.580> that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
I can simply scan it right to that

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.100 
I can simply scan it right to that
device<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.150> let's<00:04:40.300> scan<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.810> goes<00:04:40.960> to

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
device but let's scan it so it goes to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.190 
device but let's scan it so it goes to
Mike<00:04:41.260> scan<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:42.070> computer<00:04:42.810> let's<00:04:43.810> make<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.020> a

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
Mike scan to computer let's make it a

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.340 
Mike scan to computer let's make it a
PDF<00:04:44.650> document<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:46.510> what<00:04:46.690> it's<00:04:46.810> gonna<00:04:46.960> do<00:04:47.200> now

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
PDF document and what it's gonna do now

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.410 
PDF document and what it's gonna do now
is<00:04:47.620> prepare<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.130> scan<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:49.060> can<00:04:49.210> see<00:04:49.330> it

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
is prepare to scan you can see it

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.760 
is prepare to scan you can see it
automatically<00:04:49.900> takes<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.320> from<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.590> sheet

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
automatically takes it from the sheet

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.350 
automatically takes it from the sheet
for<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.950> nice<00:04:51.100> thing<00:04:51.310> about<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.730> is<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.060> if

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
for the nice thing about that is that if

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.270 
for the nice thing about that is that if
I<00:04:52.540> had<00:04:52.720> more<00:04:53.020> than<00:04:53.080> one<00:04:53.350> page<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.860> send<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.160> Mike

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
I had more than one page to send to Mike

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.680 
I had more than one page to send to Mike
I<00:04:54.430> could<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:54.760> simply<00:04:54.880> leave<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.360> on<00:04:55.450> there

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
I could just simply leave it on there

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.330 
I could just simply leave it on there
and<00:04:55.870> head<00:04:55.990> head<00:04:56.320> head<00:04:56.350> away<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:57.010> then<00:04:57.130> as

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
a JPEG or in this case where I've saved

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.030 
a JPEG or in this case where I've saved
it<00:05:06.220> as<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.370> PDF<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.690> again<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.170> shows<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.860> that

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
it as a PDF and again it shows you that

it as a PDF and again it shows you that
it's<00:05:09.310> all<00:05:09.700> wireless<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.510> I'm<00:05:10.690> completely<00:05:11.320> free

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
it's all wireless so I'm completely free

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.280 
it's all wireless so I'm completely free
of<00:05:11.710> cables<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:12.580> again<00:05:12.850> then<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.600> know<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.110> guess

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
of cables so again then you know I guess

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.720 
of cables so again then you know I guess
