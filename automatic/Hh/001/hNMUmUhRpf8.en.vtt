00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 welcome dogs i would like today 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.540
 tell about elementary in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.360
 cooking tips for peaceful fishing 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 fish such as carp bream and roach 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.539
 carp well let's start with us 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.640
 need we need raw 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 egg 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:31.830
 which we have to boil hard boiled 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.340
 I opened you have to further us 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.649
 need a pencil 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:46.640
 more precisely this is the iron part of it we remove or 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:52.920
 pliers or hands so I took off 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:01:01.219
 drew a grater from here and take our 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:08.600
 take the egg on the fishing start 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.600
 like this scroll in protein 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:23.790
 either with a stick or with the same pencil 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:27.659
 starting to push our protein can 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.560
 be white if yolk's a little bit 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560
 already prepared 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 very easy everything is done so neatly 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 we get 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 better of course the protein is hooked 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.090
 if you have me here 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.850
 the white yolk together is also very 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.580
 well you can still take just such 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 mold 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:16.630
 it is split 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:21.400
 which I cut off will get 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:27.450
 I will show you how it is possible 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:35.100
 do exactly the same way we press 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:40.690
 scrolling so now we take spices 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 We press and we have our protein 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:50.740
 place the yolk back to good for 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.950
 use on the float rod on 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.950
 donku it crashes crashes 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.290
 here and the sofa on the hook in different ways 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.970
 I use from such a mold 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.239
 from such rent now we will dress on 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.239
 hook 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:28.230
 first day they little nadadochku 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.230
 Elementary orakalom so 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.930
 the protein keeps well the yolk splits 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.930
 montale 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:49.180
 very good takes fish how to recognize and 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.180
 denim bigger 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:04:00.190
 so too we pierce such a case even 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.430
 hook can be hidden sting hook 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.190
 or use a slightly larger beam 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.920
 I think everyone understands everything 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.520
 watched subscribe to my channel 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.520
