I<00:00:17.460> started<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.150> by<00:00:18.480> stamping<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.470> ledger

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
I started out by stamping the ledger

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.150 
I started out by stamping the ledger
image<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.939> pool<00:00:21.390> shadow<00:00:21.779> ink<00:00:22.109> onto<00:00:22.410> some

with<00:00:31.289> some<00:00:31.859> stays<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.489> ink<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:35.120> you'll<00:00:36.120> want

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
with some stays on ink and you'll want

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
with some stays on ink and you'll want
to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.540> sure<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.110> an<00:00:37.230> ink<00:00:37.469> similar<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to be sure to use an ink similar to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850 
to be sure to use an ink similar to
stays<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.000> won't<00:00:39.360> bleed<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.590> put

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.420 
stamped image now I'm going to pull out
some<00:01:04.570> of<00:01:04.600> my<00:01:04.839> watercolor<00:01:05.350> pencils<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.070> start

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
some of my watercolor pencils and start

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.300 
some of my watercolor pencils and start
to<00:01:06.580> color<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.300> image<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.979> if<00:01:09.160> you've

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
to color in the image now if you've

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.609 
to color in the image now if you've
never<00:01:09.340> worked<00:01:09.910> with<00:01:10.180> watercolor<00:01:11.170> pencils

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
never worked with watercolor pencils

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.520 
never worked with watercolor pencils
before<00:01:11.860> they<00:01:12.760> look<00:01:13.030> exactly<00:01:13.330> like<00:01:13.780> regular

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
before they look exactly like regular

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.490 
before they look exactly like regular
colored<00:01:14.830> pencils<00:01:15.250> but<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.540> pigment<00:01:17.050> used<00:01:17.260> in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
colored pencils but the pigment used in

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.280 
colored pencils but the pigment used in
these<00:01:17.619> pencils<00:01:18.160> is<00:01:18.399> water<00:01:18.640> soluble<00:01:19.290> which

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
these pencils is water soluble which

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.370 
these pencils is water soluble which
means<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.210> colors<00:01:22.570> will<00:01:22.720> easily<00:01:22.930> blend

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
means that the colors will easily blend

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.790 
means that the colors will easily blend
together<00:01:23.560> just<00:01:24.310> by<00:01:24.520> adding<00:01:24.729> water<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:26.560> going

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
together just by adding water I'm going

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.180 
together just by adding water I'm going
to<00:01:26.890> start<00:01:27.190> out<00:01:27.369> by<00:01:27.700> tracing<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.500> stems<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
to start out by tracing the stems of the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:42.800 
to start out by tracing the stems of the
flower<00:01:30.550> with<00:01:31.420> my<00:01:31.930> green<00:01:32.170> pencil

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.160 

now<00:01:43.810> I'm<00:01:43.960> going<00:01:44.230> to<00:01:44.260> take<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.800> thin<00:01:45.190> paint<00:01:45.610> brush

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now I'm going to take a thin paint brush

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.390 
now I'm going to take a thin paint brush
dip<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.200> into<00:01:47.410> some<00:01:47.980> water

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
dip it into some water

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.170 
dip it into some water
and<00:01:48.630> trace<00:01:49.630> all<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.320> those<00:01:50.560> stems<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:51.820> just

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
and trace all of those stems that I just

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.130 
and trace all of those stems that I just
colored<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:54.120> it's<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.240> little<00:01:55.450> hard<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.750> see

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
colored and it's a little hard to see

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.760 
colored and it's a little hard to see
here<00:01:56.170> but<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.820> color<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.900> starting<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.500> spread

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
here but the color is starting to spread

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.370 
here but the color is starting to spread
and<00:02:00.160> all<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.730> rough<00:02:00.970> lines<00:02:01.300> from<00:02:01.780> your<00:02:01.990> pencil

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
and all the rough lines from your pencil

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.450 
and all the rough lines from your pencil
are<00:02:02.650> disappearing<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:08.500> I'm<00:02:08.619> going<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.920> color

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
are disappearing here I'm going to color

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
and the leaves using a little bit

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.190 
and the leaves using a little bit
different<00:02:11.770> method<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.490> put<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:13.600> water<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.140> my

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
paintbrush and then rub it directly on

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.280 
paintbrush and then rub it directly on

to the tip of my pencil and once I have
color<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.010> brush<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.700> will<00:02:22.180> start<00:02:22.780> painting

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
color on my brush I will start painting

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.030 
color on my brush I will start painting
the<00:02:23.410> Leafs<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.780> need<00:02:26.110> more<00:02:26.380> color<00:02:26.680> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the Leafs and as I need more color and

just go back to the pencil and add water
as<00:02:30.070> necessary

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.229

now I'm going to color in the flowers

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.020 
now I'm going to color in the flowers
using<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.379> same<00:02:44.650> method<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:45.310> taking<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
using this same method of taking the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.240 
using this same method of taking the
color<00:02:46.269> directly<00:02:46.900> from<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.739> tip<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.099> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
color directly from the tip of the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.850 
color directly from the tip of the
pencil
