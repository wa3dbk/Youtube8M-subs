the larger items like the chassis we

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.350 
the larger items like the chassis we
also<00:00:15.679> use<00:00:16.009> them<00:00:16.250> for<00:00:16.400> producing<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:16.910> tool<00:00:17.150> and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
also use them for producing the tool and

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.660 
also use them for producing the tool and
block<00:00:17.509> patterns<00:00:18.110> which<00:00:18.830> are<00:00:18.950> the<00:00:19.040> basis<00:00:19.490> for

200 miles an hour and it's really

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.640 
200 miles an hour and it's really
important<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.630> car<00:00:44.900> looks<00:00:45.290> at<00:00:45.500> it's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
important that the car looks at it's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.410 
important that the car looks at it's
very<00:00:45.710> best<00:00:46.040> because<00:00:46.880> of<00:00:47.000> course<00:00:47.210> it's

through a whole range of frequencies to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.930 
through a whole range of frequencies to
see<00:01:29.440> where<00:01:29.740> different<00:01:30.190> parts<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.670> car

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
see where different parts of the car

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.390 
see where different parts of the car
vibrates<00:01:31.510> just<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:32.470> in<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.680> road<00:01:32.860> car<00:01:33.160> when

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
vibrates just like in a road car when

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.710 
vibrates just like in a road car when
you<00:01:33.520> get<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> certain<00:01:33.880> speed<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.600> your

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
you get to a certain speed in your

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.170 
you get to a certain speed in your
dashboard<00:01:34.979> starts<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.070> vibrate<00:01:36.220> different

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
dashboard starts to vibrate different

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.460 
dashboard starts to vibrate different
parts<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.479> our<00:01:37.600> race<00:01:37.810> car<00:01:38.080> will<00:01:38.229> do<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> same

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
parts of our race car will do the same

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.609 
parts of our race car will do the same
thing<00:01:38.950> but<00:01:39.610> it's<00:01:39.759> extremely<00:01:40.210> violent<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.500> we

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
thing but it's extremely violent so we

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.910 
thing but it's extremely violent so we
need<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.920> know<00:01:42.070> where<00:01:42.250> those<00:01:42.430> points<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:43.920> also

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
need to know where those points are also

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.550 
need to know where those points are also
and<00:01:45.520> more<00:01:45.850> interestingly<00:01:46.150> we've<00:01:47.140> recorded

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
and more interestingly we've recorded

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
and more interestingly we've recorded
telemetry<00:01:48.040> which<00:01:48.490> means<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.940> we<00:01:49.090> can

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
telemetry which means that we can

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.999 
telemetry which means that we can
simulate<00:01:49.479> any<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.140> circus<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.680> we<00:01:50.830> race

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
simulate any of the circus that we race

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
simulate any of the circus that we race
on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 

now<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.909> use<00:01:57.119> computer<00:01:57.750> simulation

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now with all we use computer simulation

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.499 
now with all we use computer simulation
more<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.009> these<00:01:59.250> days<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.970> engineering

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
more and more these days for engineering

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.749 
more and more these days for engineering
analysis<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.740> still<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> requirement<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
analysis there's still a requirement to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
analysis there's still a requirement to
make<00:02:03.000> physical<00:02:03.270> tests<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.590> may<00:02:04.799> put<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> nose

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
make physical tests we may put a nose

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
make physical tests we may put a nose
onto<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.000> rig<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> fatigue<00:02:07.229> test

regulation<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.590> apply<00:02:13.830> hydraulic<00:02:14.580> loads

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
regulation is to apply hydraulic loads

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.150 
regulation is to apply hydraulic loads
to<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.060> chassis<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.959> squeeze<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.950> put

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
to the chassis we squeeze it and we put

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
to the chassis we squeeze it and we put
loads<00:02:17.430> onto<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.030> fact<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.660> load<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.959> we

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
loads onto it in fact the load that we

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.750 
loads onto it in fact the load that we
put<00:02:19.440> onto<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.830> role<00:02:20.040> hoop<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.640> the
