00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.410
 tailored to lengths and areas in the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.410
 retina 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.960
 the taking of images and the measurements of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.940
 lengths and areas are essential 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.610
 in the diagnosis and control of 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.000
 retinal lesions because they help us 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.720
 build an ophthalmology more and more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.750
 scientific measures are made of 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.030
 several ways but especially one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 taking as a unit of measurement the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 diameter and disc area 'two with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 Direct measurements on the screen of the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.610
 computer of the images obtained with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 a retinograph measures obtained with the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.340
 retinograph the retinograph is a device 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 with special lenses and a camera 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.610
 to photograph the retina your computer 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.560
 allows to process color images 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.409
 contrast brightness and measure directly 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.049
 distances and areas Fundus the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.970
 Real images of the retina appear 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.210
 very broad on the screen of the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.820
 computer but every retinograph has a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 own extension code that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.220
 allows you to calculate 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.560
 real of each part of the image captured 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 see this example the computer of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.119
 retinograph always indicates that the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.720
 actual diameter of the optical disc of this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.630
 patient is 1620 microns although 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.580
 we increase the image as standard 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.159
 they use microns for distances 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 small and millimeters for distances 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.009
 greater the microns are represented with the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.280
 Greek letter very remember that a 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.100
 millimeter equals 1000 microns on 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.100
 optical disk as a unit of measurement in the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 retina when comparing measurements within the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.080
 same image the proportions are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.750
 they keep even though we increase them the disc 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.209
 optical is used as a unit of measurement in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.580
 the retina for lengths is used the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.030
 diameter of disk and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.040
 surfaces the disc area has to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.340
 agreement it is accepted that the diameter of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.739
 disk is about 1500 microns 15 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.069
 millimeters but it's actually something 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.800
 greater than 18 to 2 millimeters on average 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.410
 when exploring the retina 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.220
 imagine that the person is watching us 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.290
 with said eye the yellow arrows 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.720
 indicate an injury that corresponds to a 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.470
 macular degeneration associated with age 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.550
 May such injury has 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.010
 approximately half of the area of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.620
 disk and it is located in the temporary zone 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.320
 lower than the center of the macula 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.780
 therefore we will describe the injury as 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.030
 one mesh approximately average 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.480
 temporary disk area less than 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.570
 center of the macula measures regarding 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.420
 optical disc and with retinograph in the 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.810
 Macular injury is usually used 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.980
 microns as a unit of measure 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.530
 we present an eye fund with 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 diabetic retinopathy arrows 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.230
 indicate a ring of exudates in the area 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.680
 temporal superior of the macula whose area 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.500
 36 42 square millimeters is superior 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.400
 to the disk area 27 42 millimeters 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
 squares 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.150
 said ring of exudates is located at 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.160
 10 45 millimeters that is to say less than a 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 Diameter of disc with respect to cm 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.200
 of the macula therefore we will say that there is 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.600
 a ring of hard exudates greater than one 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.030
 disk area less than a diameter of 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.550
 disc from the center of the macula that like 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.640
 we will see in your day corresponds with a 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.060
 clinically significant macular edema 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.950
 that requires laser treatment 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.130
 macular degeneration associated with age 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.590
 in the next case we observe an eye 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.070
 left with a plus is signaled by 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.090
 arrows 317 microns temporary at 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.630
 center of the macula the disc has 48 55 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.240
 square millimeters and the injury 340 3 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.600
 square millimeters ie the injury 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.740
 is approximately 70% of the area of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.440
 disk therefore this is a ademar 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.690
 TiVo oozes hemorrhagic 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.870
 approximately 70% of the disc area 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.420
 located about 300 microns temporary at 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.810
 center of the macula colloid melanoma 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.210
 the next example is a melanoma of 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.120
 choroid that is the most malignant tumor 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.030
 frequent in the fundus of the adult 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.290
 given its size and location 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.270
 we will use the millimeters to 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.650
 lengths and square millimeters 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.020
 for surfaces the tumor is at 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.680
 35 d from distance with respect to the disc 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.850
 optical 640 5 mm as measured by the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.699
 retinograph and 15 of 10 27 45 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.160
 millimeters from the center of the macula 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:12.419
 horizontal diameter of the melanoma is 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.150
 about 45 of 10 82 35 millimeters according to 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.510
 indicates the retinograph the disc area 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 is 25 87 square millimeters and the 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.570
 tumor has about 11 disk areas that 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.510
 correspond to 31 24 millimeters 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.510
 square therefore we are facing a 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.720
 melanoma of ccoo reid is 82 35 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:38.880
 45 mm diameter diameter 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.100
 horizontal located at 640 5 millimeters 35 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.260
 from the temporary edge of the disk 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:49.000
 optical and about 27 45 millimeters 15 of des 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.480
 with respect to the center of the macula 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.150
 precise measurements are essential 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.250
 for a scientific ophthalmology 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.530
 allow to assess eye injuries 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.170
 correctly compare the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.480
 results in the successive controls and 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.320
 draw conclusions from the effectiveness of 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.320
 treatments
