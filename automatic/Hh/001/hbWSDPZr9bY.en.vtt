forging seen for a couple of years you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.459

probably<00:00:44.640> recognize<00:00:45.149> blazes<00:00:45.929> name<00:00:46.140> he's<00:00:46.289> got

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
probably recognize blazes name he's got

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.669 
probably recognize blazes name he's got
quite<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> few<00:00:47.010> solid<00:00:47.309> maps<00:00:47.670> under<00:00:48.089> his<00:00:48.239> belt

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
quite a few solid maps under his belt

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.709 
quite a few solid maps under his belt
but<00:00:49.679> I<00:00:50.190> would<00:00:50.460> argue<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.179> certainly

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but I would argue that this is certainly

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.169 
but I would argue that this is certainly
one<00:00:51.929> of<00:00:51.960> his<00:00:52.170> best<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.339> don't<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.789> anyone

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
one of his best and I don't think anyone

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.069 
one of his best and I don't think anyone
would<00:00:54.359> dispute<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.409> claim<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:57.079> dispute

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
would dispute that claim so dispute

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.160 
would dispute that claim so dispute
actually<00:00:59.069> reminds<00:00:59.519> me<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.909> the<00:01:00.120> story<00:01:00.179> Bungie

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
actually reminds me of the story Bungie

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.259 
actually reminds me of the story Bungie
tells<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.069> design<00:01:02.550> process<00:01:02.729> behind

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
tells about the design process behind

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.310 
tells about the design process behind
hillo<00:01:03.809> threes<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.470> pit<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:06.420> story<00:01:06.930> kind

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
hillo threes the pit and that story kind

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.390 
hillo threes the pit and that story kind
of<00:01:07.850> they<00:01:08.850> talk<00:01:09.090> about<00:01:09.120> how<00:01:09.860> they<00:01:10.860> went<00:01:11.130> through

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
of they talk about how they went through

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.480 
of they talk about how they went through
different<00:01:11.910> iterations<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.650> pit<00:01:13.920> where

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
different iterations on the pit where

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
different iterations on the pit where
originally<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.660> center<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.140> map<00:01:16.320> was

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
originally the center of the map was

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
originally the center of the map was
this<00:01:16.710> lowered<00:01:17.250> trench<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.480> obviously

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
this lowered trench and that obviously

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.990 
this lowered trench and that obviously
didn't<00:01:19.230> work<00:01:19.260> because<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:19.740> no

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
didn't work because there's no

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070 
didn't work because there's no
segmentation<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.180> map<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:21.960> they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
segmentation in the map and then they

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.010 
segmentation in the map and then they
tried<00:01:22.410> like<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.010> raised<00:01:23.370> platform<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
tried like a raised platform in the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
tried like a raised platform in the
center<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> could<00:01:25.800> get<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:25.980> top<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
center that you could get on top of and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
center that you could get on top of and
then<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.480> course<00:01:27.540> they<00:01:27.870> eventually<00:01:28.050> went<00:01:28.410> with

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
then of course they eventually went with

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.100 
then of course they eventually went with
the<00:01:28.620> negative<00:01:28.980> space<00:01:29.130> actual<00:01:29.850> wall<00:01:30.150> dividing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the negative space actual wall dividing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.880 
the negative space actual wall dividing
the<00:01:31.230> pit<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:32.280> dispute<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.990> more

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the pit but dispute actually is more

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
the pit but dispute actually is more
akin<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.300> second<00:01:37.170> option<00:01:37.520> where<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
akin to the second option where there is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.240 
akin to the second option where there is
actually<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.870> raised<00:01:40.230> platform<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.160> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
actually this raised platform in the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
actually this raised platform in the
middle<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.720> dispute<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.050> of<00:01:43.110> shaped

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
middle and dispute is kind of shaped

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.950 
middle and dispute is kind of shaped
like<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> pit<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.610> has<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.150> minor

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
like the pit it it has some minor

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.550 
like the pit it it has some minor
similarities<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.350> map

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
similarities there so the way this map

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
similarities there so the way this map
works<00:01:49.830> though<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.580> has<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
works though is it actually has the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.570 
works though is it actually has the
bases<00:01:52.230> on<00:01:52.380> either<00:01:52.500> end<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> has

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
bases on either end and then it has

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.200 
bases on either end and then it has
these<00:01:53.910> lowered<00:01:54.720> courtyards<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.880> center

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
these lowered courtyards in the center

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.770 
these lowered courtyards in the center
and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.630> actual<00:01:58.050> central<00:01:58.620> platform<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
and then the actual central platform and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
and then the actual central platform and
there<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.470> lot<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.820> interesting

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
there are a lot of really interesting

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.360 
there are a lot of really interesting
sight<00:02:03.630> lines<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.200> map<00:02:04.410> particularly<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
sight lines on this map particularly in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.370 
sight lines on this map particularly in
the<00:02:05.610> middle<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.180> central<00:02:07.140> platform

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the middle so that central platform

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.070 
the middle so that central platform
actually<00:02:07.940> more<00:02:08.940> or<00:02:09.060> less<00:02:09.209> blocks<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> line<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
actually more or less blocks the line of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.770 
actually more or less blocks the line of
sight<00:02:10.229> between<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.979> bases<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.629> whole

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
sight between the bases but that whole

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.839 
sight between the bases but that whole
central<00:02:13.109> area<00:02:13.499> is<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:13.980> pretty<00:02:14.189> open<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
central area is actually pretty open and

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.280 
central area is actually pretty open and
then

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
then

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.709 
then
central<00:02:15.829> platform<00:02:16.099> is<00:02:16.549> really<00:02:17.299> really

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
central platform is really really

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.839 
central platform is really really
powerful<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.469> can<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> lot<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.670> map

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
powerful you can see a lot of the map

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.849 
powerful you can see a lot of the map
from<00:02:20.090> up<00:02:20.269> there<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.349> get<00:02:21.469> some<00:02:21.620> really

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
from up there you can get some really

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.380 
from up there you can get some really
powerful<00:02:22.099> sight<00:02:22.609> lines<00:02:22.849> but<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.239> also

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
powerful sight lines but it's also

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.020 
powerful sight lines but it's also
really<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:23.989> exposed<00:02:24.799> and<00:02:25.189> in<00:02:25.760> order<00:02:25.879> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
really really exposed and in order to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.970 
really really exposed and in order to
get<00:02:26.269> up<00:02:26.390> there<00:02:26.629> you<00:02:26.659> either<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.530> do<00:02:27.680> some

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
get up there you either have to do some

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.670 
get up there you either have to do some
pretty<00:02:28.310> tricky<00:02:28.790> jumps<00:02:29.180> which<00:02:29.689> well<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.290> say

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
pretty tricky jumps which well I say

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.009 
pretty tricky jumps which well I say
they're<00:02:30.859> tricky<00:02:31.189> you<00:02:32.060> might<00:02:32.510> not<00:02:32.659> find<00:02:32.870> them

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
they're tricky you might not find them

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.960 
they're tricky you might not find them
tricky<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.739> think<00:02:34.189> they're<00:02:34.340> hard<00:02:34.700> because

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
tricky but I think they're hard because

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.569 
tricky but I think they're hard because
i<00:02:35.209> suck<00:02:35.269> at<00:02:35.480> jumping<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.950> have<00:02:37.189> to<00:02:37.370> go

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
i suck at jumping or you have to go

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.390 
i suck at jumping or you have to go
around<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> outside<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.750> map<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
around the outside of the map to you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610 
around the outside of the map to you
know<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:41.120> up<00:02:41.239> there<00:02:41.420> from<00:02:41.689> one<00:02:42.439> of<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
know it get up there from one of the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.440 
know it get up there from one of the
sides<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.159> of<00:02:43.519> course<00:02:43.730> one<00:02:43.939> side<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.299> map

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
sides and of course one side of the map

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.209 
sides and of course one side of the map
actually<00:02:44.689> has<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.049> sniper<00:02:45.709> rifle<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:46.189> the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
actually has the sniper rifle and the

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.569 
actually has the sniper rifle and the
other<00:02:46.370> side<00:02:46.639> has<00:02:46.939> the<00:02:47.239> over<00:02:47.689> shield<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.579> those

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
other side has the over shield and those

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.240 
other side has the over shield and those
are<00:02:49.609> both<00:02:49.819> really<00:02:50.150> useful<00:02:50.829> particularly<00:02:51.829> in

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
are both really useful particularly in

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.000 
are both really useful particularly in
offensive<00:02:53.019> scenarios<00:02:54.019> when<00:02:54.409> you're<00:02:54.590> pushing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
offensive scenarios when you're pushing

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.629 
offensive scenarios when you're pushing
the<00:02:55.430> enemy<00:02:55.790> flag<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.260> also<00:02:57.470> defensively<00:02:58.430> as

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
the enemy flag but also defensively as

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.780 
the enemy flag but also defensively as
well<00:02:58.669> and<00:02:59.060> then<00:02:59.709> our<00:03:00.709> sorry<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.430> rocket

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
well and then our sorry that the rocket

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.940 
well and then our sorry that the rocket
launcher<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.989> over<00:03:03.260> shield<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.650> rocket

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
launcher and the over shield the rocket

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.580 
launcher and the over shield the rocket
launchers<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.459> center<00:03:04.790> under<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
launchers in the center under the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.920 
launchers in the center under the
central<00:03:06.980> platform<00:03:07.189> that<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.750> more

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
central platform that is that is more

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.629 
central platform that is that is more
offensive<00:03:09.530> than<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.010> sniper<00:03:10.310> rifle

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
offensive than the sniper rifle

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.729 
offensive than the sniper rifle
obviously<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:11.659> all<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:12.169> weapons<00:03:12.439> have<00:03:12.590> their

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
obviously but all the weapons have their

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.280 
obviously but all the weapons have their
place<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.250> they're<00:03:14.150> all<00:03:14.299> quite<00:03:14.629> useful<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
place and they're all quite useful and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.220 
place and they're all quite useful and
definitely<00:03:15.889> worth<00:03:16.280> contesting<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.989> those

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
definitely worth contesting so those

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.830 
definitely worth contesting so those
lines<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.919> sight<00:03:19.069> from<00:03:19.400> top<00:03:19.879> mid<00:03:20.120> are<00:03:20.359> really

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
lines of sight from top mid are really

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.110 
lines of sight from top mid are really
really<00:03:21.079> important<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:22.220> hold<00:03:22.370> during<00:03:22.699> flag

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
really important to hold during flag

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.199 
really important to hold during flag
games<00:03:23.479> and<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:24.290> course<00:03:24.319> during<00:03:25.010> flag<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
games and of course during flag the

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.180 
games and of course during flag the
fastest<00:03:26.750> way<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.959> pull<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.500> flags<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.949> right

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
fastest way to pull the flags is right

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.949 
fastest way to pull the flags is right
through<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.579> center<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.449> you'll<00:03:29.569> find<00:03:29.840> that

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
through the center but you'll find that

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.369 
through the center but you'll find that
it's<00:03:30.139> very<00:03:30.440> very<00:03:30.859> dangerous<00:03:31.400> very<00:03:31.659> exposed<00:03:32.659> in

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
it's very very dangerous very exposed in

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.009 
it's very very dangerous very exposed in
those<00:03:33.620> courtyards<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:35.780> it's

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
those courtyards and you know so it's

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.300 
those courtyards and you know so it's
kind<00:03:36.229> of<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.379> risk<00:03:36.560> versus<00:03:36.829> reward<00:03:36.949> thing

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
kind of a risk versus reward thing

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.250 
kind of a risk versus reward thing
whether<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.729> want<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.970> go<00:03:38.389> through<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.750> risky

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
whether you want to go through the risky

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.580 
whether you want to go through the risky
center<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:39.799> around<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.699> outside<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.959> in

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
center or around the outside and in

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.530 
center or around the outside and in
addition<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.250> those<00:03:43.370> tricky<00:03:43.819> jumps<00:03:44.120> up<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.449> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
addition to those tricky jumps up to the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.599 
addition to those tricky jumps up to the
center<00:03:44.930> there<00:03:45.109> are<00:03:45.199> lots<00:03:45.409> and<00:03:45.680> lots<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.400> other

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
center there are lots and lots of other

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.969 
center there are lots and lots of other
little<00:03:46.879> slide<00:03:47.269> jumps<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.930> other<00:03:48.500> little

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
little slide jumps and other little

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.610 
little slide jumps and other little
trick<00:03:49.340> jumps<00:03:49.669> around<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:50.120> map<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:51.199> lots<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
trick jumps around the map and lots of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.460 
trick jumps around the map and lots of
opportunities<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> get<00:03:52.970> flag<00:03:53.329> throws<00:03:53.840> up<00:03:54.199> into

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
opportunities to get flag throws up into

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.500 
opportunities to get flag throws up into
the<00:03:54.560> bases<00:03:54.979> and<00:03:55.099> whatnot<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:56.030> it's<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.329> really

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the bases and whatnot so it's a really

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.899 
the bases and whatnot so it's a really
really<00:03:56.870> fantastic<00:03:57.169> flag<00:03:57.919> map<00:03:58.189> and<00:03:58.699> it's<00:03:58.819> a

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
really fantastic flag map and it's a

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.089 
really fantastic flag map and it's a
solid<00:03:59.090> Slayer<00:03:59.479> map<00:03:59.689> as<00:03:59.900> well<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.319> imagine<00:04:01.040> you

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
solid Slayer map as well I imagine you

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.469 
solid Slayer map as well I imagine you
could<00:04:01.220> get<00:04:01.400> some<00:04:01.549> solid<00:04:01.909> games<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.359> other

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
could get some solid games of other

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.479 
could get some solid games of other
things<00:04:02.750> like<00:04:02.930> capsule<00:04:03.409> or<00:04:03.560> King<00:04:04.129> the<00:04:04.220> hell<00:04:04.370> on

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
things like capsule or King the hell on

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.899 
things like capsule or King the hell on
here<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:06.530> one<00:04:07.010> last<00:04:07.129> thing<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> note<00:04:07.699> with

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
here so a one last thing to note with

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.640 
here so a one last thing to note with
this<00:04:08.030> map<00:04:08.269> i<00:04:08.419> guess<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.750> was<00:04:08.780> originally

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
this map i guess it was originally

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.149 
this map i guess it was originally
designed<00:04:09.829> in<00:04:10.250> Halo<00:04:10.579> 4<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:12.530> guess<00:04:12.709> I<00:04:12.859> kind<00:04:13.099> of

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
designed in Halo 4 and I guess I kind of

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.860 
designed in Halo 4 and I guess I kind of
shows<00:04:13.400> through<00:04:13.729> in<00:04:13.939> some<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.329> scaling

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
shows through in some of the scaling

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.039 
shows through in some of the scaling
obviously<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.620> had<00:04:15.769> sprint<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:16.459> Halo<00:04:16.669> 4<00:04:17.049> so

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
obviously we had sprint in Halo 4 so

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.890 
obviously we had sprint in Halo 4 so
some<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> scaling<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.519> could<00:04:19.759> argue<00:04:20.599> that

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
some of the scaling you could argue that

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.800 
some of the scaling you could argue that
some<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.889> map<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.639> maybe<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.120> little<00:04:23.539> bit

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
some of the map is maybe a little bit

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.629 
some of the map is maybe a little bit
over-scaled<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:24.710> nothing<00:04:25.250> that's<00:04:25.400> going<00:04:25.550> to

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
over-scaled but nothing that's going to

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.560 
over-scaled but nothing that's going to
hurt<00:04:25.760> gameplay

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
hurt gameplay

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.960 
hurt gameplay
it<00:04:27.570> badly<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:28.680> it's<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.250> it's<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.550> really<00:04:29.699> solid

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
it badly so it's a it's a really solid

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.080 
it badly so it's a it's a really solid
four<00:04:30.480> before<00:04:30.810> map<00:04:31.020> lots<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:32.090> interesting

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
four before map lots of interesting

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.020 
four before map lots of interesting
sight<00:04:33.330> lines<00:04:33.540> just<00:04:33.900> well<00:04:34.199> segmented<00:04:34.800> map<00:04:35.030> and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
sight lines just well segmented map and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.490 
sight lines just well segmented map and
it's<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.240> great-looking<00:04:36.449> map<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.080> course<00:04:37.290> and

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
it's a great-looking map of course and

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260 
it's a great-looking map of course and
it's<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.889> fantastic<00:04:38.340> capture<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> flag

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
it's just a fantastic capture the flag

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.510 
it's just a fantastic capture the flag
