00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
i go into here there's three different

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.360 
i go into here there's three different
types<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.390> potion<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.130> sword<00:01:29.130> works

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
types of potion that this sword works

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.220 
types of potion that this sword works
with<00:01:29.580> there's<00:01:29.790> slowness<00:01:30.300> four<00:01:30.870> minutes<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
with there's slowness four minutes of

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.520 
with there's slowness four minutes of
slowness<00:01:31.760> poison<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.240> instant<00:01:34.140> health<00:01:34.320> -

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
slowness poison to and instant health -

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
slowness poison to and instant health -
i<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> fact<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.730> these<00:01:35.910> are<00:01:35.970> all

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
i like the fact that these are all

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
i like the fact that these are all
higher<00:01:36.990> tier<00:01:37.380> potions<00:01:37.800> they're<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.100> harder

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
higher tier potions they're a bit harder

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.070 
higher tier potions they're a bit harder
to<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.610> hold<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.150> let's<00:01:39.300> let's<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
to get hold of so let's let's do the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.230 
to get hold of so let's let's do the
slowness<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.620> first<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.910> one<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
slowness one first this one is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
slowness one first this one is
especially<00:01:42.480> useful<00:01:42.870> with<00:01:43.620> zombies<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.550> we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

effect on the mobs he uses wither so you
saw<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:18.959> taking<00:02:19.290> damage<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.769> even

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
saw that it was taking damage there even

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.559 
saw that it was taking damage there even
when<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.190> wasn't<00:02:20.370> punching<00:02:20.849> him<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.269> can<00:02:21.390> see

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
when I wasn't punching him you can see

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.630 
when I wasn't punching him you can see
that<00:02:21.720> again

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that again

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.240 
that again
yeah<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.540> taken<00:02:24.780> damage<00:02:24.930> even<00:02:25.409> though<00:02:25.830> I'm

yeah it's taken damage even though I'm

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
yeah it's taken damage even though I'm
not<00:02:26.700> damaging<00:02:27.150> him<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.650> he<00:02:28.769> used<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.040> wither

not damaging him and he used the wither

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.970 
not damaging him and he used the wither
effect<00:02:29.519> instead<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.819> poison<00:02:30.780> because<00:02:30.980> poison

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
effect instead of poison because poison

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
effect instead of poison because poison
doesn't<00:02:32.370> affect<00:02:32.640> Undead<00:02:33.120> mobs<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.900> fact<00:02:34.110> quite

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
doesn't affect Undead mobs in fact quite

doesn't affect Undead mobs in fact quite
a<00:02:34.350> few<00:02:34.910> hostile<00:02:35.910> mobs<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.209> not<00:02:36.330> affected

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
a few hostile mobs and not affected

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.000 
a few hostile mobs and not affected
my<00:02:36.810> poison<00:02:36.990> at<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.380> where<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.650> where<00:02:37.860> there

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
my poison at all where is where there

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.560 
my poison at all where is where there
seems<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.400> lot<00:02:38.520> more<00:02:38.640> universal<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
seems to be a lot more universal so that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.350 
seems to be a lot more universal so that
was<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.720> very<00:02:40.320> good<00:02:40.790> change<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
was a very good change to that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
was a very good change to that
and<00:02:42.450> finally<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.260> instant<00:02:43.620> health<00:02:43.890> 2<00:02:44.250> potion

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
and finally the instant health 2 potion

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.880 
and finally the instant health 2 potion
effect<00:02:45.090> actually<00:02:46.080> affects<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> player

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
effect actually affects the player

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.230 
effect actually affects the player
rather<00:02:47.220> than<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.520> zombie<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.180> it

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
rather than the zombie so you can see it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.030 
rather than the zombie so you can see it
gives<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.660> extra<00:02:48.870> hearts<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> can

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
gives you two extra hearts so I can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.670 
gives you two extra hearts so I can
actually<00:02:50.570> keep<00:02:51.570> regaining<00:02:52.050> these<00:02:52.320> hearts

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
actually keep regaining these hearts

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.110 
actually keep regaining these hearts
while<00:02:52.830> fighting<00:02:53.070> these<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.700> zombie

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
while fighting these up this zombie

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.530 
while fighting these up this zombie
which<00:02:54.630> makes<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> lot<00:02:55.290> more<00:02:55.920> powerful

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
which makes you a lot more powerful

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.290 
which makes you a lot more powerful
against<00:02:57.540> mobs<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.650> you'll<00:02:59.610> take<00:02:59.640> hit<00:03:00.090> and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
against mobs because you'll take hit and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.140 
against mobs because you'll take hit and
by<00:03:00.630> by<00:03:01.470> attacking<00:03:01.860> mobs<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.370> almost<00:03:02.640> steal

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
by by attacking mobs you almost steal

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.760 
by by attacking mobs you almost steal
their<00:03:03.420> hearts<00:03:03.630> from<00:03:03.990> which<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.350> really<00:03:04.590> nice

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
their hearts from which is a really nice

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.210 
their hearts from which is a really nice
really<00:03:05.760> nice<00:03:05.880> game<00:03:06.420> mode<00:03:06.660> feeling<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
really nice game mode feeling to it and

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.729 
really nice game mode feeling to it and
I<00:03:08.490> don't<00:03:08.610> think<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.360> overpowered<00:03:10.020> for

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
I don't think this is overpowered for

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920 
I don't think this is overpowered for
several<00:03:11.610> reasons<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.630> for<00:03:12.810> two

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
several reasons and I like it for two

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.130 
several reasons and I like it for two
reasons<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.590> first<00:03:14.220> reason<00:03:14.750> actually<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
reasons the first reason actually it is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.360 
reasons the first reason actually it is
technically<00:03:16.500> one<00:03:16.709> reason<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.100> there's<00:03:17.220> two

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
technically one reason but there's two

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.040 
technically one reason but there's two
parts<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.270> first<00:03:18.510> reason<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.840> simply

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
parts to it the first reason is simply

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.710 
parts to it the first reason is simply
that<00:03:19.140> golden<00:03:19.950> swords<00:03:20.400> are<00:03:20.610> useless

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
that golden swords are useless

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.500 
that golden swords are useless
because<00:03:21.959> they<00:03:22.080> break<00:03:22.350> very<00:03:22.770> quickly<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
because they break very quickly and in a

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.330 
because they break very quickly and in a
normal<00:03:24.780> survival<00:03:25.290> settings<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.010> don't<00:03:26.250> know

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
normal survival settings I don't know

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.070 
normal survival settings I don't know
about<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.120> don't<00:03:27.180> really<00:03:27.450> use<00:03:27.630> potions

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
about you but I don't really use potions

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.170 
about you but I don't really use potions
much<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> think<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.550> adds<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:30.000> really

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
much so I think that it adds a really

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.110 
much so I think that it adds a really
nice<00:03:30.330> effect<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:32.340> reason<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.970> I

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
nice effect like that the reason that I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.729 
nice effect like that the reason that I
don't<00:03:33.180> think<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:33.600> overpowered<00:03:34.050> is<00:03:34.260> because

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
don't think it's overpowered is because

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.000 
don't think it's overpowered is because
golden<00:03:35.610> swords<00:03:36.030> break<00:03:36.720> quickly<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.860> can

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
golden swords break quickly so you can

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
golden swords break quickly so you can
only<00:03:38.130> fight<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.580> few<00:03:38.940> mobs<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.510> sword

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
only fight a few mobs with the sword

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.740 
only fight a few mobs with the sword
before<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:41.489> runs<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.299> need<00:03:42.480> another

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
before it runs out and you need another

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.410 
before it runs out and you need another
one<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.410> I've<00:03:43.920> only<00:03:44.040> hit<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.459> couple<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.000> moms<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
one so I've only hit a couple of moms so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.970 
one so I've only hit a couple of moms so
what<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.870> four<00:03:46.170> or<00:03:46.290> five<00:03:46.350> now<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
what is it like four or five now and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.210 
what is it like four or five now and
it's<00:03:47.100> nearly<00:03:47.340> dead<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.420> don't<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:49.220> get

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
it's nearly dead so you don't really get

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.449 
it's nearly dead so you don't really get
get<00:03:50.820> an<00:03:50.940> effect<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.070> being<00:03:53.250> too

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
get an effect of of it being too

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.160 
get an effect of of it being too
overpowered<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.000> my<00:03:54.120> opinion<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:54.810> see<00:03:54.959> here

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
overpowered in my opinion I can see here

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.860 
overpowered in my opinion I can see here
I'm<00:03:55.340> mixing<00:03:56.340> all<00:03:56.489> three<00:03:56.760> effects<00:03:57.180> here<00:03:57.360> he

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
I'm mixing all three effects here he

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.150 
I'm mixing all three effects here he
also<00:03:57.989> mentions<00:03:58.320> both<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.739> saturation

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
also mentions both at the saturation

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.970 
also mentions both at the saturation
effect<00:03:59.580> will<00:03:59.820> affect<00:04:00.260> players<00:04:01.260> other<00:04:01.560> players

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
effect will affect players other players

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.620 
effect will affect players other players
nearby<00:04:02.370> within<00:04:02.700> three<00:04:02.970> blocks<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.450> so

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
nearby within three blocks of you so

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.479 
nearby within three blocks of you so
sort<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.260> nice<00:04:04.410> multiplayer<00:04:05.010> aspect<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.459> it

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
sort of a nice multiplayer aspect to it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.090 
sort of a nice multiplayer aspect to it
as<00:04:05.670> well<00:04:06.079> so<00:04:07.079> yeah<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.260> think<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.650> isn't<00:04:07.920> really

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
as well so yeah I think it isn't really

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.800 
as well so yeah I think it isn't really
overpowered<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> potions<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.540> course

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
overpowered and the potions of course

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.710 
overpowered and the potions of course
you<00:04:10.500> have<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.890> grind<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.910> little<00:04:11.970> bit<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:12.690> a

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
you have to grind a little bit and get a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.000 
you have to grind a little bit and get a
little<00:04:12.870> bit<00:04:13.019> through<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> game<00:04:13.530> before<00:04:13.799> you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
little bit through the game before you

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.560 
little bit through the game before you
can<00:04:14.160> use<00:04:14.430> those<00:04:14.640> potions<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.239> their<00:04:15.360> higher

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
can use those potions and their higher

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.880 
can use those potions and their higher
tier<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.200> need<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> little<00:04:16.769> bit

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
tier so you need to put a little bit

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.830 
tier so you need to put a little bit
more<00:04:17.040> work<00:04:17.340> into<00:04:17.880> producing<00:04:18.299> them<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.780> they

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
more work into producing them and they

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.300 
more work into producing them and they
take<00:04:19.019> up<00:04:19.140> some<00:04:19.260> inventory<00:04:19.650> space<00:04:19.859> so

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
take up some inventory space so

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.030 
take up some inventory space so
all-in-all<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.479> like<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.750> plugin<00:04:22.040> the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
all-in-all I really like this plugin the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.820 
all-in-all I really like this plugin the
plug-in<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:23.580> be<00:04:23.660> changed<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.990> support<00:04:25.470> other

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
plug-in can be changed to support other

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.270 
plug-in can be changed to support other
potion<00:04:26.640> effects<00:04:27.270> as<00:04:27.450> well<00:04:27.720> quite<00:04:28.140> easily<00:04:28.350> but

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
potion effects as well quite easily but

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.620 
potion effects as well quite easily but
I've<00:04:29.460> decided<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.910> leave<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.090> with<00:04:30.300> just<00:04:30.510> these

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
I've decided to leave it with just these

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.690 
I've decided to leave it with just these
three<00:04:30.690> because<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.410> think<00:04:31.590> it's<00:04:32.220> quite<00:04:32.430> nicely

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
three because I think it's quite nicely

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.430 
three because I think it's quite nicely
balanced<00:04:33.120> with<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.419> three<00:04:33.600> effects<00:04:33.960> it

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
balanced with just three effects it

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.080 
balanced with just three effects it
might<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.890> bit<00:04:34.979> too<00:04:35.220> much<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:35.669> fer<00:04:35.880> if

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
might be a little bit too much if fer if

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.560 
might be a little bit too much if fer if
more<00:04:36.660> things<00:04:36.840> were<00:04:36.990> added<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:38.400> I'm<00:04:38.790> not<00:04:38.970> really

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
more things were added so I'm not really

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.900 
more things were added so I'm not really
gonna<00:04:39.780> explain<00:04:40.229> too<00:04:40.800> much<00:04:40.830> how<00:04:41.310> this<00:04:41.520> works

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
gonna explain too much how this works

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.610 
gonna explain too much how this works
since<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.450> not<00:04:42.540> my<00:04:42.750> design<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:43.470> there's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
since it's not my design but there's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.279 
since it's not my design but there's
always<00:04:43.740> there<00:04:44.010> will<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.430> schematic<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:46.110> a

discussing<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.640> for<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.790> little<00:05:32.880> bit<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.300> it

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
discussing it for a little bit and it

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.630 
discussing it for a little bit and it
looks<00:05:33.870> like<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.500> really<00:05:34.800> cool<00:05:35.010> idea<00:05:35.190> I'm

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
looks like a really cool idea I'm

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.520 
looks like a really cool idea I'm
definitely<00:05:36.030> going<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.210> be<00:05:36.300> trying<00:05:36.600> this<00:05:36.840> one<00:05:37.050> I

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
definitely going to be trying this one I

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.950 
definitely going to be trying this one I
think<00:05:37.860> it's<00:05:38.130> gonna<00:05:38.220> have<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.460> nice<00:05:38.700> effect<00:05:39.060> to

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
think it's gonna have a nice effect to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.780 
think it's gonna have a nice effect to
the<00:05:40.080> gameplay<00:05:40.470> if<00:05:41.190> you<00:05:41.280> have<00:05:41.400> an<00:05:41.460> idea<00:05:41.730> for

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
the gameplay if you have an idea for

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.920 
the gameplay if you have an idea for
something<00:05:41.910> you'd<00:05:42.150> like<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.360> see<00:05:42.510> me<00:05:42.630> try<00:05:42.780> and
