accelerates<00:01:43.109> the<00:01:43.350> longer<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.920> scroll

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
accelerates the longer that you scroll

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.130 
accelerates the longer that you scroll
through<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> list<00:01:44.700> meaning<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.719> can<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
through the list meaning you can get to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.800 
through the list meaning you can get to
the<00:01:46.229> end<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.429> at<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> w's<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> matter

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the end way down at the w's in a matter

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
the end way down at the w's in a matter
of<00:01:48.899> seconds<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.890> another<00:01:50.159> big<00:01:50.460> requested

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

form<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.310> riff<00:01:53.609> repeater<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.689> let's<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.109> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
form of riff repeater so let's go to a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080

received numerous suggestions that it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
received numerous suggestions that it
would<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> great<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.850> could<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.060> select

that<00:02:10.229> speed<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> we've<00:02:11.310> implemented<00:02:11.849> just

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that speed and we've implemented just

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.540 
that speed and we've implemented just
that<00:02:12.599> feature<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.590> let's<00:02:13.769> take<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.159> outro

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that feature so let's take the outro

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.580 
that feature so let's take the outro

arrangement which is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.960 
arrangement which is
really<00:02:17.680> difficult<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.370> let's<00:02:18.760> run<00:02:18.940> it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
really difficult and let's run it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.830 
really difficult and let's run it
through<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.270> accelerator<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:22.270> generally

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
through the accelerator now generally

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.990 
through the accelerator now generally
the<00:02:23.020> accelerator<00:02:23.560> was<00:02:23.800> used<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.340> first<00:02:24.610> gauge

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the accelerator was used to first gauge

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.330 
the accelerator was used to first gauge
your<00:02:25.030> performance<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.500> give<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> set

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
your performance and then give you a set

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.400 
your performance and then give you a set
speed<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.880> play<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.239> riff<00:02:28.390> back<00:02:28.630> at<00:02:28.870> based<00:02:29.200> on

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
speed to play the riff back at based on

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.680 
speed to play the riff back at based on
your<00:02:29.560> initial<00:02:29.680> performance<00:02:30.099> it<00:02:30.730> still<00:02:31.420> works

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
your initial performance it still works

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.479 
your initial performance it still works
that<00:02:31.930> way<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.770> you'd<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.160> actually

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
that way but if you'd like to actually

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.940 
that way but if you'd like to actually
undercut<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.750> process<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.560> set<00:02:35.769> your<00:02:35.920> own

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
undercut that process and set your own

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.430 
undercut that process and set your own
speed<00:02:36.430> automatically<00:02:37.269> we've<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:37.959> given<00:02:38.319> you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440

the<00:02:38.560> ability<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.099> do<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.480> let's<00:02:40.900> complete<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the ability to do so so let's complete a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.720 
the ability to do so so let's complete a
quick<00:02:41.530> tuning<00:02:41.920> check<00:02:42.160> here<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.550> then<00:02:42.640> I'll

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
quick tuning check here and then I'll

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:58.770 
quick tuning check here and then I'll
show<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:42.970> how<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.150> done<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.450> says<00:02:58.630> to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
show you how it's done so it says to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300 
show you how it's done so it says to
play<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.080> section<00:02:59.319> once<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.980> get<00:03:00.100> your

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
play the section once to get your

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.910 
play the section once to get your
starting<00:03:00.730> speed<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:02.290> let's<00:03:02.470> say<00:03:02.620> we<00:03:02.799> don't

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.130 
starting speed but let's say we don't
want<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.310> do<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.459> we'll<00:03:04.420> push<00:03:04.630> start<00:03:04.959> and

immediately and it'll go right down to
70<00:03:35.069> so<00:03:36.069> this<00:03:36.280> should<00:03:36.459> make<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.760> riff<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.090> little

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
70 so this should make the riff a little

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.259 
70 so this should make the riff a little
bit<00:03:37.420> more<00:03:37.600> manageable<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:38.290> play<00:03:39.269> especially

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
bit more manageable to play especially

00:03:40.269 --> 00:04:03.240 
bit more manageable to play especially
if<00:03:40.359> it's<00:03:40.540> really<00:03:40.870> difficult

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.310 

now<00:04:03.790> you'll<00:04:04.000> notice<00:04:04.210> upon<00:04:04.690> completing<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
now you'll notice upon completing the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.710 
now you'll notice upon completing the
riff<00:04:05.470> at<00:04:05.650> seventy<00:04:06.040> percent<00:04:06.160> speed

riff at seventy percent speed

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.330

successfully you're actually thrown back

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.970 
successfully you're actually thrown back
into<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.850> riff<00:04:10.090> at<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.510> same<00:04:10.750> speed<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.440> this

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
into the riff at the same speed and this

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.250 
into the riff at the same speed and this
will<00:04:12.220> go<00:04:12.460> like<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.270> at<00:04:13.540> seventy<00:04:14.110> percent

you've completed the accelerator

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.220 
you've completed the accelerator
activity<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.360> now<00:04:52.510> that<00:04:52.750> I've<00:04:52.840> resumed

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
activity so now that I've resumed

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.110 
activity so now that I've resumed
acceleration<00:04:54.010> if<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.550> play<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.910> song

successfully<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:55.930> seventy<00:04:56.350> percent<00:04:56.500> you'll

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
successfully at seventy percent you'll

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.850 
successfully at seventy percent you'll
notice<00:04:57.850> that<00:04:57.880> after<00:04:58.330> successfully<00:04:59.290> doing<00:04:59.620> so

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
notice that after successfully doing so

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.510 
notice that after successfully doing so
you'll<00:05:00.760> level<00:05:01.030> up<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.390> phrase<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.530> higher

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
you'll level up the phrase to a higher

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:21.030 
you'll level up the phrase to a higher
speed<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:05.110> larger<00:05:05.440> percentage

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.710 

so<00:05:22.040> this<00:05:22.250> will<00:05:22.430> actually<00:05:22.610> level<00:05:23.120> up<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.419> speed

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
so this will actually level up the speed

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.040 
so this will actually level up the speed
and<00:05:23.960> get<00:05:24.410> to<00:05:24.560> eighty-one<00:05:25.010> percent<00:05:25.040> now

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
and get to eighty-one percent now

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.210 
and get to eighty-one percent now
successful<00:05:27.050> completion<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.740> will<00:05:27.979> level

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
successful completion of this will level

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.939 
successful completion of this will level
up<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.460> speed<00:05:28.699> so<00:05:28.970> forth<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:30.080> get<00:05:30.290> to<00:05:30.470> 100

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
up the speed so forth and you get to 100

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.460 
up the speed so forth and you get to 100
and<00:05:31.160> complete<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:32.180> activity<00:05:32.690> it's<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.229> great

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
and complete the activity it's a great

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.379 
and complete the activity it's a great
way<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.680> practice<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.460> it's<00:05:34.850> also<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.180> great
