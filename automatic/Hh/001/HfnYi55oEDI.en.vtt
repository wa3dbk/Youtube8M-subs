and the j1 and both have close to the
same<00:00:33.780> features<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.710> feature<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.219> I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
same features but the one feature that I

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060 
same features but the one feature that I
was<00:00:35.460> interested<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.200> was<00:00:37.200> both<00:00:37.440> equals<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
was interested in was both equals so I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
was interested in was both equals so I
went<00:00:38.250> preferred<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> cheaper<00:00:39.390> camera<00:00:39.719> for

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
went preferred the cheaper camera for

this<00:00:40.050> review<00:00:40.350> now<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> other<00:00:42.059> cameras

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this review now with the other cameras

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.970 
this review now with the other cameras
that<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> talked<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.379> stuff<00:00:43.590> why<00:00:43.770> would

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that I talked about and stuff why would

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.450 
that I talked about and stuff why would
I<00:00:44.010> bring<00:00:44.450> this<00:00:45.450> knife<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.260> gunfight<00:00:46.710> well

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I bring this knife the gunfight well

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.380 
I bring this knife the gunfight well
here's<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> reason<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
here's the reason and by the way this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
here's the reason and by the way this
isn't<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:51.930> great<00:00:52.260> price<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> lens

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
isn't a really great price with the lens

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
isn't a really great price with the lens
you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.690> gh2<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> same

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you can get a gh2 for basically the same

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
you can get a gh2 for basically the same
price<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.180> 600<00:00:57.719> bucks<00:00:59.780> anyway<00:01:00.780> besides

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
price it's like 600 bucks anyway besides

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.340 
price it's like 600 bucks anyway besides
the<00:01:01.350> point<00:01:02.210> what<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the point what this can do is it can

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310 
the point what this can do is it can
shoot<00:01:04.939> 400<00:01:05.939> frames<00:01:06.060> per<00:01:06.299> second<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.689> 1200

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
shoot 400 frames per second and 1200

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
shoot 400 frames per second and 1200
frames<00:01:07.500> per<00:01:07.710> second<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.460> 1200<00:01:09.030> frames<00:01:09.360> per

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
frames per second now 1200 frames per

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
frames per second now 1200 frames per
second<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> image<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.680> small<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
second the image is so small that it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
second the image is so small that it's
basically<00:01:12.659> unusable<00:01:12.960> unless<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.490> know

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
basically unusable unless I don't know

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
basically unusable unless I don't know
maybe<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> magic<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
maybe there's some kind of magic that I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
maybe there's some kind of magic that I
don't<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:18.000> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
don't know about that will make that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.859 
don't know about that will make that
usable<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> 400<00:01:21.090> frames<00:01:21.270> per<00:01:21.540> second

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
usable but the 400 frames per second

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
usable but the 400 frames per second
mode<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.770> best<00:01:25.159> definitely<00:01:26.159> under<00:01:26.400> $1000

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
mode is the best definitely under $1000

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.859

and<00:01:27.330> best<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> can<00:01:28.290> find<00:01:29.600> anywhere<00:01:30.600> near

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

and best that I can find anywhere near
that<00:01:31.079> price<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.860> shoots<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.610> 640<00:01:33.509> by<00:01:33.750> 240<00:01:34.560> at

that price it shoots it's 640 by 240 at

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.760 
that price it shoots it's 640 by 240 at
400<00:01:35.670> frames<00:01:35.850> per<00:01:36.180> second<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.560> isn't

because<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:50.909> shooting<00:01:51.829> anamorphic<00:01:53.930> which<00:01:54.930> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because I'm shooting anamorphic which is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
because I'm shooting anamorphic which is
another<00:01:55.470> interesting<00:01:55.920> point<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.149> aspect

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
another interesting point the aspect

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
another interesting point the aspect
ratio<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.290> crops<00:01:58.560> down<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> sensor<00:01:59.310> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
ratio when it crops down the sensor to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.679 
ratio when it crops down the sensor to
the<00:01:59.670> slow-motion<00:02:00.450> mode<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.049> essentially<00:02:01.829> an

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
the slow-motion mode is essentially an

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.819 
the slow-motion mode is essentially an
anamorphic<00:02:03.689> sized<00:02:03.990> aspect<00:02:04.799> ratio<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:06.829> what

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
anamorphic sized aspect ratio so what

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
anamorphic sized aspect ratio so what
I've<00:02:07.979> been<00:02:08.250> working<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> make

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I've been working on is a way to make

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
I've been working on is a way to make
that<00:02:09.929> usable<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> way<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> make

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that usable now there is a way to make

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.010 
that usable now there is a way to make
that<00:02:11.849> useful<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> clips<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
that useful in that all the clips that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.650 
that useful in that all the clips that
you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.230

digitally<00:02:19.120> enhanced<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.320> because

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
digitally enhanced and that is because

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.070 
digitally enhanced and that is because
you're<00:02:22.240> not<00:02:22.360> gonna<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.570> able<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.750> see<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> menu

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
you're not gonna be able to see the menu

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.270 
you're not gonna be able to see the menu
because<00:02:23.200> i<00:02:23.380> can't<00:02:23.620> focus

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
because i can't focus

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.150 
because i can't focus
close<00:02:24.970> enough<00:02:25.420> here<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.090> menu<00:02:29.160> there

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
close enough here but in the menu there

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.870 
close enough here but in the menu there
are<00:02:31.440> options<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.190> know<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.640> being<00:02:33.790> a

nikon camera and being a small nikon
camera<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.220> does<00:02:36.490> have<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> good<00:02:37.030> set<00:02:37.450> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480

manual<00:02:38.440> controls<00:02:39.310> for<00:02:39.840> most<00:02:40.840> functions<00:02:41.380> it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
manual controls for most functions it's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.920 
manual controls for most functions it's
really<00:02:42.430> annoying<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.970> use<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.360> focus<00:02:43.570> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
really annoying to use the focus and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.750 
really annoying to use the focus and
everything<00:02:44.020> but<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.250> set<00:02:45.550> things

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
everything but you can set things

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.260 
everything but you can set things
manually<00:02:46.240> which<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.750> better<00:02:47.290> than<00:02:47.620> say<00:02:47.890> ad<00:02:48.460> 90

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.930

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.750 
when you get into picture control
there's<00:02:58.240> an<00:02:58.390> option<00:02:59.080> for<00:02:59.110> picture<00:02:59.590> control<00:02:59.920> in

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
there I've chosen the neutral picture

there I've chosen the neutral picture

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
and after of what sharpening at default

and after of what sharpening at default
and<00:03:11.440> sharpening<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:11.950> Sarah<00:03:12.130> looks<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:12.550> you

and sharpening and Sarah looks like you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
and sharpening and Sarah looks like you
would<00:03:13.510> never<00:03:13.780> use<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.560> sharpening<00:03:14.980> up

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
would never use the sharpening up

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.860 
would never use the sharpening up
because<00:03:15.610> when<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.000> goes<00:03:16.150> into<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.540> crop

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
because when it goes into that crop

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.980 
because when it goes into that crop
sensor<00:03:17.290> mode<00:03:17.470> or<00:03:17.710> that<00:03:18.160> cropped<00:03:18.670> down

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
sharpening looks really really terrible

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.860 
sharpening looks really really terrible
and<00:03:25.810> in<00:03:26.290> there<00:03:26.470> there<00:03:26.860> there's<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.510> good<00:03:28.510> amount

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and in there there there's a good amount

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930 
and in there there there's a good amount
of<00:03:28.960> controls<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.710> thing<00:03:29.920> about<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.670> get

of controls the thing about is you get

you can click this into original quality
and<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.300> could<00:03:49.450> probably<00:03:49.630> read<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:53.970> but

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and you could probably read that but

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.030 
and you could probably read that but
that's<00:03:55.300> what<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.570> did<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:56.020> make<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.530> usable

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that's what I did to make this usable

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.230 
that's what I did to make this usable
and<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.400> tell<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.640> difference<00:03:57.970> when<00:03:58.090> I

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
and you can tell the difference when I

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.790 
and you can tell the difference when I
first<00:03:58.480> started<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:58.990> looked<00:03:59.170> terrible<00:03:59.590> and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
first started it looked terrible and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.920 
first started it looked terrible and
then<00:04:00.400> using<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.780> actually

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
then using it like that it actually

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.160 
then using it like that it actually
becomes<00:04:02.260> slightly<00:04:02.830> usable<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.720> other<00:04:04.900> thing

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
becomes slightly usable the other thing

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.850 
becomes slightly usable the other thing
is<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:06.570> we're<00:04:07.570> gonna<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:08.080> added

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
is is that we're gonna I added

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.770 
is is that we're gonna I added
information<00:04:09.010> with<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> little<00:04:09.910> bit<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.150> noise<00:04:10.360> a

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
information with a little bit of noise a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.920 
information with a little bit of noise a
little<00:04:11.350> bit<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:12.000> magic<00:04:13.000> bullet<00:04:13.360> grain<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
little bit of magic bullet grain and

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.750 
little bit of magic bullet grain and
then<00:04:16.930> with<00:04:17.170> twixtor<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.920> was<00:04:18.160> able<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.640> up

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
then with twixtor I was able to get up

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.870 
then with twixtor I was able to get up
to<00:04:19.650> 3200<00:04:20.650> frames<00:04:20.890> per<00:04:21.070> second<00:04:21.400> which<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.669> lot

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
to 3200 frames per second which is a lot

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.190 
to 3200 frames per second which is a lot
more<00:04:22.060> than<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.419> get<00:04:22.660> out<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.080> say<00:04:24.060> 60

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
more than I can get out of say 60

per second camera wars sometimes I can

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.120 
per second camera wars sometimes I can
get<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> thousand<00:04:27.810> frames<00:04:27.930> per<00:04:28.200> second<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:31.130> wish

get a thousand frames per second I wish

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.530 
get a thousand frames per second I wish
there<00:04:32.610> was<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:33.510> higher<00:04:34.200> end<00:04:34.500> way<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.300> run<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.510> a

there was a higher end way to run that a

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.240 
there was a higher end way to run that a
higher<00:04:36.750> anyway<00:04:37.080> but<00:04:37.290> yes<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> higher<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.100> way

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
higher anyway but yes a higher and way

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.430 
higher anyway but yes a higher and way
to<00:04:38.310> get<00:04:38.730> high<00:04:39.390> frames<00:04:39.720> per<00:04:39.930> second<00:04:40.290> but<00:04:40.380> I

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
to get high frames per second but I

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.890 
to get high frames per second but I
don't<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:40.830> that's<00:04:41.070> going<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.400> happen

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
don't think that's going to happen

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.700 
don't think that's going to happen
anytime<00:04:42.900> soon<00:04:43.370> unfortunately<00:04:44.370> if<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.390> want

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
anytime soon unfortunately if you want

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.430 
anytime soon unfortunately if you want
at<00:04:46.710> least<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.370> probably<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:47.850> next<00:04:48.440> six

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
at least in the probably the next six

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.680 
at least in the probably the next six
months<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.100> be<00:04:50.340> able<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.610> shoot<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:51.000> 400<00:04:51.510> frames

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
months to be able to shoot at 400 frames

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.470 
months to be able to shoot at 400 frames
per<00:04:51.960> second<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.580> probably<00:04:54.090> your<00:04:54.300> best

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
per second this is probably your best

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.810 
per second this is probably your best
bet<00:04:54.690> now<00:04:55.170> for<00:04:55.680> me<00:04:57.320> there's<00:04:58.400> there's<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.550> problem

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
bet now for me there's there's a problem

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.760 
bet now for me there's there's a problem
with<00:05:00.060> my<00:05:00.090> camera<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.140> got<00:05:01.350> and

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
with my camera that I just got and

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.410 
with my camera that I just got and
testing<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.610> think<00:05:03.030> there's<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.270> problem

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
testing it I think there's a problem

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.750 
testing it I think there's a problem
with<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:04.020> white<00:05:04.740> balance<00:05:04.950> it's<00:05:05.370> been

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
with the white balance it's been

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.390 
with the white balance it's been
balancing<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.540> strange<00:05:07.020> colors<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.250> the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
balancing and strange colors that is the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.430 
balancing and strange colors that is the
one<00:05:08.670> thing<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.210> bothers<00:05:09.750> me<00:05:09.780> about<00:05:10.020> this

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
one thing that bothers me about this

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.250 
one thing that bothers me about this
because<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.950> can't<00:05:11.220> set<00:05:11.700> my<00:05:12.210> white<00:05:12.810> balance<00:05:13.910> via

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
because I can't set my white balance via

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.020 
because I can't set my white balance via
Kelvin<00:05:16.260> menu<00:05:16.860> like<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.070> do<00:05:17.190> on<00:05:17.430> my<00:05:17.460> other

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
Kelvin menu like I do on my other

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.890 
Kelvin menu like I do on my other
cameras<00:05:18.570> all<00:05:18.690> my<00:05:18.810> other<00:05:18.960> cameras<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.900> mean

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
cameras all my other cameras so I mean

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.870 
cameras all my other cameras so I mean
in<00:05:22.080> terms<00:05:22.320> of<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.590> compact<00:05:23.220> camera<00:05:23.430> this<00:05:23.700> is

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
in terms of a compact camera this is

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.910 
in terms of a compact camera this is
probably<00:05:24.360> has<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:25.020> most<00:05:25.050> amount<00:05:25.440> of<00:05:25.530> controls

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
probably has the most amount of controls

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.220 
probably has the most amount of controls
I<00:05:26.220> haven't<00:05:26.880> tested<00:05:27.030> at<00:05:27.360> gf3

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
I haven't tested at gf3

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.140 
I haven't tested at gf3
it<00:05:28.530> probably<00:05:29.130> has<00:05:29.340> all<00:05:29.550> those<00:05:29.700> manual

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
it probably has all those manual

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.660 
it probably has all those manual
controls<00:05:30.510> but<00:05:30.780> for<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.020> Nikon<00:05:31.440> it's<00:05:32.400> very

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
controls but for a Nikon it's very

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.740 
controls but for a Nikon it's very
impressive<00:05:33.240> for<00:05:33.540> people<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.550> well<00:05:35.750> I'd

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
impressive for people that well I'd

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.810 
impressive for people that well I'd
still<00:05:37.050> go<00:05:37.200> with<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:37.650> Panasonic<00:05:37.980> just<00:05:38.550> because

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
still go with the Panasonic just because

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.850 
still go with the Panasonic just because
you<00:05:39.630> can't<00:05:39.900> get<00:05:40.020> adapters<00:05:40.500> for<00:05:40.710> your<00:05:40.800> other

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
you can't get adapters for your other

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.150 
you can't get adapters for your other
Nikon<00:05:41.310> lenses<00:05:41.700> but<00:05:41.970> they're<00:05:42.570> going<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.990> be

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
Nikon lenses but they're going to be

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.670 
Nikon lenses but they're going to be
stratospheric<00:05:44.160> and

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
stratospheric and

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.620 
stratospheric and
you<00:05:46.680> know<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.830> won't<00:05:47.400> have<00:05:47.640> any<00:05:47.970> wide-angle

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
you know you won't have any wide-angle

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.270 
you know you won't have any wide-angle
lens<00:05:48.810> if<00:05:49.020> you're<00:05:49.140> going<00:05:49.290> to<00:05:49.530> adapt<00:05:49.860> your<00:05:50.070> old

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280

lens if you're going to adapt your old
Nikon<00:05:50.730> lenses<00:05:51.120> in<00:05:51.690> any<00:05:51.930> case<00:05:52.230> this<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:52.920> a<00:05:53.100> good

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
Nikon lenses in any case this is a good

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.770 
Nikon lenses in any case this is a good
option<00:05:54.570> for<00:05:55.490> web<00:05:56.490> slow<00:05:56.850> motion<00:05:57.180> videos<00:05:57.480> it's

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
option for web slow motion videos it's

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.820 
option for web slow motion videos it's
the<00:05:58.500> Casio<00:05:59.430> had<00:05:59.790> the<00:06:00.090> last<00:06:00.330> high-speed<00:06:01.230> motion

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
the Casio had the last high-speed motion

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.710 
the Casio had the last high-speed motion
camera<00:06:02.160> that<00:06:02.340> would<00:06:02.460> shoot<00:06:02.700> at<00:06:03.180> a<00:06:03.390> lower

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
camera that would shoot at a lower

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.800 
camera that would shoot at a lower
resolution<00:06:04.020> than<00:06:04.470> this<00:06:04.800> back<00:06:05.580> in<00:06:05.850> 2008<00:06:06.630> and

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
resolution than this back in 2008 and

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.720 
resolution than this back in 2008 and
it's<00:06:06.900> been<00:06:07.080> discontinued<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:07.950> buying<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.580> now

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
it's been discontinued and buying it now

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.360 
it's been discontinued and buying it now
is<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:09.000> more<00:06:09.270> expensive<00:06:09.600> this<00:06:10.320> is<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.560> very<00:06:11.190> good

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
is it more expensive this is a very good

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.530 
is it more expensive this is a very good
option<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:14.160> counter<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.120> don't<00:06:15.360> know

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
option and to counter that I don't know

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.840 
option and to counter that I don't know
of<00:06:15.660> any<00:06:15.810> other<00:06:15.870> cameras<00:06:16.470> that<00:06:16.650> will<00:06:17.460> do<00:06:17.670> the

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
of any other cameras that will do the

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.750 
of any other cameras that will do the
same<00:06:18.030> thing<00:06:18.270> this<00:06:18.570> will<00:06:18.810> do<00:06:19.020> at<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.980> speed<00:06:20.460> so

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
same thing this will do at that speed so

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.990 
same thing this will do at that speed so
it's<00:06:20.910> impressive<00:06:21.230> for<00:06:22.230> doing<00:06:22.530> that<00:06:22.940> in<00:06:23.940> terms

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
it's impressive for doing that in terms

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.340 
it's impressive for doing that in terms
of<00:06:24.480> other<00:06:24.750> video<00:06:25.140> performance<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:27.350> codec

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
of other video performance the codec

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.290 
of other video performance the codec
kind<00:06:28.620> of<00:06:28.710> falls<00:06:28.920> apart<00:06:29.310> when<00:06:29.580> used<00:06:29.940> so<00:06:30.240> I

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
kind of falls apart when used so I

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.240 
kind of falls apart when used so I
wouldn't<00:06:30.600> really<00:06:30.810> recommend<00:06:30.930> it<00:06:31.470> over<00:06:31.830> say<00:06:32.220> a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
wouldn't really recommend it over say a

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.930 
wouldn't really recommend it over say a
hacked<00:06:32.670> gh1<00:06:33.510> or<00:06:34.020> gh2<00:06:34.350> but<00:06:35.310> when<00:06:35.550> you<00:06:35.670> pan

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
hacked gh1 or gh2 but when you pan

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.490 
hacked gh1 or gh2 but when you pan
you're<00:06:36.330> going<00:06:36.480> to<00:06:36.540> get<00:06:36.660> macro<00:06:37.050> blocking

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
you're going to get macro blocking

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.100 
you're going to get macro blocking
because<00:06:37.590> they're<00:06:37.830> just

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
because they're just

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.470 
because they're just
isn't<00:06:38.350> enough<00:06:38.590> data<00:06:38.830> in<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.580> codec<00:06:39.970> but<00:06:40.330> for

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
isn't enough data in the codec but for

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.730 
isn't enough data in the codec but for
slow<00:06:40.630> motion<00:06:40.810> this<00:06:41.080> is<00:06:41.200> the<00:06:41.290> only<00:06:41.470> one<00:06:41.590> that

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
slow motion this is the only one that

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.250 
slow motion this is the only one that
does<00:06:41.860> what<00:06:42.040> it<00:06:42.070> does<00:06:42.160> so<00:06:42.550> take<00:06:42.940> that<00:06:43.150> as<00:06:43.300> you

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
does what it does so take that as you

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.380 
does what it does so take that as you
will<00:06:44.440> and<00:06:44.740> so<00:06:45.070> it's<00:06:45.250> a<00:06:45.340> cool<00:06:45.550> little<00:06:45.700> camera<00:06:46.180> a

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
will and so it's a cool little camera a

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.840 
will and so it's a cool little camera a
little<00:06:47.140> flash<00:06:49.170> but<00:06:50.170> I'd<00:06:50.440> only<00:06:50.470> use<00:06:50.770> it<00:06:51.100> in

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
little flash but I'd only use it in

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.490 
little flash but I'd only use it in
video<00:06:52.510> purposes<00:06:53.080> for<00:06:54.450> super<00:06:55.450> slow<00:06:55.630> motion<00:06:55.870> for
