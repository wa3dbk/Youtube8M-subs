Hi! This is Leslie Sack with expertvillage.com.
You can check my website at www.lesliesack.com.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.500
We are doing cross body lead for the men.
Now it is really important to understand when

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.130
you are doing the basic steps, the basic pattern
the forward and back then go to basic you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.480
can turn it left or you can turn it right.
What is going to happen the front being the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.080
man and the leader, if I need to change my
direction and I usually turn when I am going

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.360
backwards. I'm going to go back a little bit
then I'm going to turn a little bit left then

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.150
go back on my right foot. I could also go
right I'm going to turn when I go backwards.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.300
So you could understand you could turn the
basic either right or left. Right feels a

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:00.399
little different. Just try it for yourself
and see which one you like better. It would

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.881
work either way. When are going to cross body
lead, cross body lead changes you not suddenly.

00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:04.881
Here's a cross body lead. I am going to go
forward and then change a 180 degrees, change

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:17.830
directions all in one basic. So you want to
know the right way to do it, I will show you.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.782
Your forward on the left, back to the right.
So I am going to do forward first and I did

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:30.090
it turn in a pigeon toe right foot in a little
bit and then I do a Â¼ turn to my left. So

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.310
now my partner is on my right side and I am
going to bring her through and my right foot

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.409
is going to come in underneath me and I'm
going to rock back and that is the end of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.630
my basic. So most of it happened in the first
3 steps. So it's 1, 2, 3, hold4 and you'll

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.930
bring her through on 5, 6, 7, 8. Okay, one
more time. So 1, 2, 3, hold, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:19.900
1, 2, 3, hold, 4, 5, 6, 7, hold, 8. 1,2,3
she stays over to your right side, bring her

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:28.170
through 5. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is important
on the 3, 1, 2, 3 you open your feet which

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.650
is going to stepping between your feet and
you don't want to get stepped on. Then you

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.652
go through.
