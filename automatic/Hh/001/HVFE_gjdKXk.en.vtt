have the light bar assembly here it

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
have the light bar assembly here it
already<00:01:45.679> has<00:01:45.950> double<00:01:46.429> sided<00:01:46.610> tape<00:01:46.759> attached

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
to the back of it I pulled that back

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.730 
to the back of it I pulled that back
because<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.840> was<00:01:50.929> just<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.259> little<00:01:51.440> bit<00:01:51.530> quicker

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740

you're going to route the cable just

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.110 
you're going to route the cable just
like<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:12.160> then<00:02:13.160> we're<00:02:13.670> going<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.850> pull<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
like that then we're going to pull the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.350 
like that then we're going to pull the
tape<00:02:14.329> off<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.660> back<00:02:15.640> put<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:16.970> side

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.290 

so<00:02:19.930> we're<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.320> install<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.850> light<00:02:22.030> bar

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
so we're going to install the light bar

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.400 
so we're going to install the light bar
right<00:02:23.020> inside<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.680> housing<00:02:24.430> assembly<00:02:25.410> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
right inside the housing assembly just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.880 
right inside the housing assembly just
like<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.400> press<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:29.260> too<00:02:29.530> hard

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
like that just press it in not too hard

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.860 
like that just press it in not too hard
use<00:02:30.070> your<00:02:30.250> fingers<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.820> don't<00:02:31.480> recommend<00:02:31.690> you

use your fingers I don't recommend you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.090 
use your fingers I don't recommend you
using<00:02:32.050> any<00:02:32.320> tools<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.860> don't<00:02:32.980> want

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
using any tools because you don't want

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.120 
using any tools because you don't want
to<00:02:33.160> damage<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.550> LEDs<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:35.290> double-sided

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
to damage the LEDs and this double-sided

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
to damage the LEDs and this double-sided
tape<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.580> pretty<00:02:36.820> strong<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.780> don't<00:02:38.440> think

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
tape is pretty strong so I don't think

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.810 
tape is pretty strong so I don't think

straightforward but there could be a few
questions<00:03:24.100> about<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.410> we<00:03:26.740> screw<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.130> in

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
questions about this so we screw that in

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.360 
questions about this so we screw that in
make<00:03:27.820> sure<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.209> snug<00:03:28.330> don't<00:03:29.160> over<00:03:30.160> tighten
