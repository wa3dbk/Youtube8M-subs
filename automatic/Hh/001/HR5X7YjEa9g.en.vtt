00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.880
 we are back in ours 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.880
 instead of the first thing I show you here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.400
 want is the groundwater map this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.199
 consists of a simulation skate on 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.900
 the water resources in this area too 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.470
 The green areas are visible 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.940
 more and the brown less water on 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.699
 Let's take a look at the water tower 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.190
 the city supplies the tower is one 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.930
 simple simulation unit the rules 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.019
 Performs around the city ​​with water too 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.659
 supplying water is pumped out running 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.750
 the animation goes down at the same time 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.430
 the groundwater map of the water levels 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 the pumped out water is packed 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.739
 and in the form of active simulation objects 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.659
 these are then sent over 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 the pipes to the consumers in the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.270
 buildings 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.640
 here is a whole row of houses 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.299
 their daily water needs just 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 is covered 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.530
 the buildings need in certain 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.159
 time intervals always new 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.890
 supplies 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.200
 the industry sector has now the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 soil pretty badly pollutes the ground 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.310
 Pollution is already up 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.890
 Water tower penetrated when my tower 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.899
 Now water is getting out of the ground 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.499
 automatically also polluted water 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.320
 promoted 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:37.469
 the germs are then through the active ones 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.659
 redistributes objects when the sims releases 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.149
 the contaminated water diseases 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.850
 here we see a group of sims the 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.679
 had to report sick sick sims 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 can not work and so on 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.659
 financial burden on the city 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.659
 become
