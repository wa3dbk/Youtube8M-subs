00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.479
 the need to reduce emissions from civilian households was due to the 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.590
 derivatives are pointing in the same direction 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.840
 to use cleaner fuels, alcohol has the advantage of being less 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.480
 pollution that causes comparison with petroleum-derived fuels 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.919
 ten years ago the 'teacher' already registered 6 whistles the federal university of 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.460
 developed a low-cost alcohol micro-distillery for the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.689
 production of this fuel for the producer's own consumption 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.260
 for consumption in a group of associates and the small and medium 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.070
 farmer always so late and that can the productive chain that can provide a 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 local 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.320
 socially correct is correctly correct with a lower cost what 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.300
 he makes every effort 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.980
 he does not have one however to the wings of the cane 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.470
 you can hear more the two of the animals will mix with the remains 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.870
 of distillation John saw another federal recipe and action 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.940
 and the producer of cachaça also to be able to take advantage of the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.450
 discarded that transformed into fuel alcohol with great efficiency of 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.360
 200 liters of cachaça 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 the teacher states that 70 liters of alcohol can be withdrawn for 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 author, whatever the easiest thing and the building itself that already has 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.939
 all the equipment since the campaign already has slight 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.319
 we already have two movies in the room and even the still today says that finding your dowry 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.670
 The hours lambic idle while we and a senate building and I passed lap of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.009
 ratification of production has given fuel is much easier to 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:33.460
 he 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.190
 what to wear well I wanted to make column appeals in the book production of 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.540
 fuel alcohol on farm in cooperative system 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.370
 the process puts the whole process in detail through technology 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.260
 developed by the 'teacher' the alcohol produced on the farm will have the same 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.830
 quality of those marketed at petrol stations throughout the country 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.939
 the main objective of the 'teacher' 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.740
 to elevate the technique developed the small producer that well peter the al-khor 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.189
 without stopping to produce with food that allows us to develop a 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700
 most appropriate technology by the 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.350
 because being more to do opera what will help exactly is to add value to the 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.980
 production of live and produce cane that will produce 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.599
 foods that 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.459
 I waited for fuel 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.349
 alternative baroque as fuel 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.250
 it is of these fuels there is no doubt or it is impossible to compete 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.759
 but today our people 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.499
 to cut sugar cane like in cane sugar struck in that sense 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:35.540
 why he baptized spreading Canada on the prism in a way that 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:36.809
 we need to feed too
