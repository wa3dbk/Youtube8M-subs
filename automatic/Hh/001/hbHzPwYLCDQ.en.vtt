how<00:00:14.759> these<00:00:14.940> apply<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> numbers<00:00:16.379> we're

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
how these apply with the numbers we're

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
how these apply with the numbers we're
going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> numbers<00:00:17.130> we're<00:00:17.910> going<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
going to the numbers we're going to do a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.380 
going to the numbers we're going to do a
1<00:00:18.960> through<00:00:19.109> 5<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.770> pools<00:00:20.210> counting<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
1 through 5 with pools counting with the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.150 
1 through 5 with pools counting with the
cross<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> always<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> come<00:00:22.890> across

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
cross so I always like to come across

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
cross so I always like to come across
because<00:00:23.340> that's<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.510> side<00:00:24.779> bang<00:00:25.080> bang

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
because that's the right side bang bang

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.259 
because that's the right side bang bang
you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.460> pull<00:00:26.670> off<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.000> come<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you can just pull off and come to the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.519 
you can just pull off and come to the
hook<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:27.990> now<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.470> go

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hook but right now we're going to go

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.849 
hook but right now we're going to go
across<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> numbers<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.960> pool<00:00:31.230> he's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
across so the numbers with pool he's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.990 
across so the numbers with pool he's
gonna<00:00:31.980> control<00:00:32.309> me<00:00:32.369> now<00:00:32.520> he's<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.790> partner

try<00:01:57.590> counter<00:01:57.920> me<00:01:58.040> pool<00:01:58.990> cross<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:01.369> do<00:02:01.460> this

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
try counter me pool cross so we do this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:12.980 
try counter me pool cross so we do this
on<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.729> few<00:02:01.790> times

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.800 

that's<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.580> how<00:02:15.580> we<00:02:15.640> work<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> pool<00:02:16.390> during

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that's that how we work the pool during

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.680 
that's that how we work the pool during

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
our combo so he's controlling me he's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.900 
our combo so he's controlling me he's
telling<00:02:19.960> what<00:02:20.110> coming<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.160> how<00:02:21.880> to
