this tutorial will demonstrate a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.530 
this tutorial will demonstrate a
chemical<00:00:05.220> peel<00:00:05.400> gone<00:00:05.790> terribly<00:00:06.210> terribly

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
chemical peel gone terribly terribly

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.259 
chemical peel gone terribly terribly
wrong<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.259> for<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.519> decided<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.150> kind

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
wrong and for this one I decided to kind

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.690 
wrong and for this one I decided to kind
of<00:00:09.360> make<00:00:09.690> up<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.170> scenario<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.130> create<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> wound

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of make up a scenario and create a wound

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.070 
of make up a scenario and create a wound
to<00:00:11.820> go<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.509> have<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.960> in

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
to go with it kind of have to do that in

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.509 
to go with it kind of have to do that in
the<00:00:13.170> real<00:00:13.290> world<00:00:13.469> that's<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> real<00:00:14.280> makeup

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the real world that's a real makeup

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
the real world that's a real makeup
artist<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.809> premise<00:00:16.080> behind<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
artist so the premise behind this is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
artist so the premise behind this is
that<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> went<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> chemical<00:00:17.880> peel<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.869> my

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that I went to get a chemical peel on my

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.349 
that I went to get a chemical peel on my
hands<00:00:19.260> obviously<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.789> ended<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.119> staying

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
hands obviously and it ended up staying

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.840 
hands obviously and it ended up staying
on<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.170> too<00:00:22.320> long<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.850> basically

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
on a little bit too long and basically

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
on a little bit too long and basically
my<00:00:24.150> skin<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.840> dissolved<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.769> hand<00:00:26.160> there's

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
my skin has dissolved a hand there's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
thin layer of clear liquid latex from

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
thin layer of clear liquid latex from
Kryolan<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.340> thin<00:00:47.610> layer<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
Kryolan this thin layer is going to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.500 
Kryolan this thin layer is going to
serve<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> base<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> blisters

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.640 

now<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.780> q-tip<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.170> want<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.440> begin

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
now with a q-tip you want to begin

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.930 
now with a q-tip you want to begin
mapping<00:00:57.100> out<00:00:57.220> where<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.460> want<00:00:57.610> your<00:00:57.730> blisters

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
mapping out where you want your blisters

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.720 
mapping out where you want your blisters
to<00:00:58.180> be<00:00:58.330> there's<00:00:59.020> no<00:00:59.200> real<00:00:59.440> pattern<00:00:59.740> just<00:01:00.400> kind

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
to be there's no real pattern just kind

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.870 
to be there's no real pattern just kind
of<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.390> know<00:01:01.510> clusters<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.050> blisters<00:01:02.620> or<00:01:03.040> big

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
of you know clusters of blisters or big

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880 
of you know clusters of blisters or big
huge<00:01:04.090> blisters<00:01:04.570> just<00:01:04.930> use<00:01:05.260> your<00:01:05.410> imagination

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
huge blisters just use your imagination

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.440 
huge blisters just use your imagination
with<00:01:06.010> this<00:01:06.130> one<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:06.940> definitely<00:01:07.300> a

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
with this one this is definitely a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.030 
with this one this is definitely a
layering<00:01:07.780> process<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.500> want<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.740> use<00:01:08.920> your

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
layering process you want to use your

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:19.620 
layering process you want to use your
q-tip<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.700> build<00:01:09.850> up<00:01:10.030> those<00:01:10.180> blisters

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.780 

liquid<00:01:20.630> latex<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.260> flexible<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.520> once<00:01:22.670> it

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
liquid latex is flexible but once it

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.950 
liquid latex is flexible but once it
dries<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.000> may<00:01:23.240> become<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.540> little<00:01:23.630> bit<00:01:23.840> too

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
dries it may become a little bit too

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.110 
dries it may become a little bit too
tight<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.350> uncomfortable<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.490> make<00:01:25.640> sure<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
tight and uncomfortable so make sure to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.030 
tight and uncomfortable so make sure to
flex<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.810> area<00:01:27.080> a<00:01:27.110> bit<00:01:27.140> as<00:01:27.440> you're<00:01:27.560> working

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
flex the area a bit as you're working

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.160 
flex the area a bit as you're working
and<00:01:28.220> while<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.940> latex<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.480> drying<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:32.170> add

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and while the latex is drying and add

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.140 
and while the latex is drying and add
more<00:01:33.380> latex<00:01:33.740> as<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:34.400> fit<00:01:36.790> once<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.970> area

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
more latex as you see fit once the area

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.330 
more latex as you see fit once the area
is<00:01:38.420> dry<00:01:38.660> add<00:01:39.020> another<00:01:39.380> thin<00:01:39.650> layer<00:01:39.680> of<00:01:39.860> red

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
is dry add another thin layer of red

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.290 
is dry add another thin layer of red
with<00:01:40.550> a<00:01:40.580> sponge

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
with a sponge

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.850 
with a sponge
this<00:01:41.840> step<00:01:42.050> will<00:01:42.230> cut<00:01:42.470> some<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
this step will cut some of the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.580 
this step will cut some of the
yellowness<00:01:43.190> at<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.460> liquid<00:01:43.730> latex<00:01:47.440> for<00:01:48.440> some

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
yellowness at the liquid latex for some

yellowness at the liquid latex for some
shine<00:01:48.860> action<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.460> went<00:01:49.700> in<00:01:49.760> with<00:01:49.880> castor<00:01:50.330> oil

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360
