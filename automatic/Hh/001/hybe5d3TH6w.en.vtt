motorcycle at 179 miles an hour we did

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
motorcycle at 179 miles an hour we did
that<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.219> thirty<00:00:47.489> four<00:00:47.730> percent<00:00:47.760> power<00:00:48.410> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that with thirty four percent power so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.660 
that with thirty four percent power so
it<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> go<00:00:49.890> quite<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.280> faster

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it is going to go quite a bit faster

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
it is going to go quite a bit faster
this<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> third<00:00:51.420> fastest<00:00:52.230> electric

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
at 213 miles an hour so we want to try

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710 
at 213 miles an hour so we want to try
to<00:01:08.070> slide<00:01:08.369> into<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.670> number<00:01:09.000> two<00:01:09.180> slot<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> i

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to slide into that number two slot and i

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
to slide into that number two slot and i
think<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.020> capable<00:01:10.500> once<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think is capable once we get the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
think is capable once we get the
batteries<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.850> controller<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> everything

batteries of controller and everything

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
batteries of controller and everything
talking<00:01:12.960> together<00:01:13.049> we're<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> does

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
talking together we're going to does

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590

this<00:01:14.040> bike<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.640> over<00:01:14.670> 200<00:01:15.270> miles

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this bike is going to go over 200 miles

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
this bike is going to go over 200 miles
now<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:16.200> targets<00:01:16.590> 240<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> motorcycle

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
now our targets 240 with this motorcycle

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.859 
now our targets 240 with this motorcycle
right<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.380> 440<00:01:22.380> volt<00:01:22.700> system<00:01:23.869> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
right here it's a 440 volt system it's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
right here it's a 440 volt system it's
150<00:01:25.380> kilowatt<00:01:25.770> motor<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.250> equals<00:01:26.670> 200

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
150 kilowatt motor which equals 200

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.069 
150 kilowatt motor which equals 200
horsepower<00:01:28.850> 458<00:01:29.850> foot-pounds<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> torque<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
horsepower 458 foot-pounds of torque so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
horsepower 458 foot-pounds of torque so
it's<00:01:31.439> basically<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.280> electric<00:01:32.850> motor<00:01:33.030> out

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it's basically it's a electric motor out

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's basically it's a electric motor out
of<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.420> school<00:01:33.720> bus<00:01:35.390> 440<00:01:36.390> volts<00:01:36.950> their<00:01:37.950> uses
