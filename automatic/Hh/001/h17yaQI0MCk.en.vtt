00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
of what the JDM 45 sounds like was to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.920 
of what the JDM 45 sounds like was to
list<00:03:55.930> Paul<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:57.310> be<00:03:57.459> very<00:03:57.760> or<00:03:58.299> is<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.629> very

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
list Paul can be very or is a very

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.490 
list Paul can be very or is a very
versatile<00:03:59.650> amp<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.549> very<00:04:00.790> heavy<00:04:01.500> but

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
versatile amp can be very heavy but

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.830 
versatile amp can be very heavy but
depends<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.280> pedals<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.060> use<00:04:04.330> so

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
depends on the pedals that you use so

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.210 
depends on the pedals that you use so
