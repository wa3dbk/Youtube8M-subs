and of course I sort of realized I
didn't<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.350> move<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.650> buddy<00:01:19.830> much<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> do

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
didn't really move my buddy much and do

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
didn't really move my buddy much and do

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
anything and I had no rhythm to my

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.740 
anything and I had no rhythm to my
playing<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:23.880> sort<00:01:24.120> of<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> big

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
playing and and that was sort of a big

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.140 
playing and and that was sort of a big
light<00:01:24.990> bulb<00:01:25.229> moment<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.740> up<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:27.030> know

it<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.920> what<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.430> all<00:02:37.610> ends<00:02:37.880> up

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
it and and what the way this all ends up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699 
it and and what the way this all ends up
is<00:02:38.180> everything<00:02:38.510> your<00:02:39.019> planes<00:02:39.290> can<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.560> have

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709

and running right from the start the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.220 
and running right from the start the
first<00:03:07.850> thing<00:03:07.910> it'll<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.569> it'll<00:03:08.810> make<00:03:09.049> you

string<00:03:16.750> all<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.840> strings<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> now<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.489> can

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
string all the strings so now you can

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.729 
string all the strings so now you can
see<00:03:19.820> I've<00:03:19.940> got<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.540> movement<00:03:20.989> from<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
see I've got this this movement from the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.580 
see I've got this this movement from the
wrist<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.549> elbow<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:24.019> all<00:03:24.260> this<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.530> very

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
wrist and the elbow and all this is very

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.500 
wrist and the elbow and all this is very
critical<00:03:25.040> for<00:03:25.489> being<00:03:25.820> able<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.060> flipping<00:03:26.450> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
critical for being able to flipping a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.810 
critical for being able to flipping a
guitar<00:03:26.810> or<00:03:27.410> play<00:03:27.590> mandolin<00:03:28.130> or<00:03:28.220> any<00:03:28.579> any

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
stringed instrument with a flat pick so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.750 
stringed instrument with a flat pick so
if<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.920> through<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.190> these<00:03:34.549> basic

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
if you go through all these basic

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.849 
if you go through all these basic
there's<00:03:35.150> only<00:03:35.239> four<00:03:35.510> basic<00:03:35.900> patterns<00:03:36.230> there's

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
there's only four basic patterns there's

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:43.280 
there's only four basic patterns there's
a<00:03:36.950> down<00:03:37.130> down<00:03:37.700> down<00:03:38.150> down<00:03:38.480> down<00:03:38.989> down<00:03:39.290> up<00:03:39.890> down

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.640 

and<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:46.300> is<00:03:46.420> another<00:03:46.750> pet<00:03:47.020> it's<00:03:47.200> got<00:03:47.319> two<00:03:47.470> ups

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and this is another pet it's got two ups

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.120 
and this is another pet it's got two ups
in<00:03:47.770> a<00:03:47.860> row<00:03:48.040> it's<00:03:48.730> out<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.120> light<00:03:49.660> red<00:03:49.810> hair<00:03:49.990> boy

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.710 

so<00:03:57.130> then<00:03:57.250> two<00:03:57.430> ops<00:03:57.550> in<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.730> row<00:03:57.880> turn<00:03:58.240> up<00:03:58.360> quite<00:03:58.690> a

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
so then two ops in a row turn up quite a

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.350 
so then two ops in a row turn up quite a
lot<00:03:58.959> in<00:03:59.230> infidel<00:03:59.800> tune<00:03:59.980> music<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.640> all<00:04:01.239> in

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
lot in infidel tune music and all in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.770 
lot in infidel tune music and all in
other<00:04:01.510> patterns<00:04:01.840> also<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> we'll<00:04:03.370> go<00:04:03.520> through

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
other patterns also so we'll go through

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.390 
other patterns also so we'll go through
patterns<00:04:04.780> one<00:04:04.959> by<00:04:05.140> one<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.590> then<00:04:06.069> I'll<00:04:06.190> show

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
patterns one by one and then I'll show

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.750 
patterns one by one and then I'll show
you<00:04:06.459> exactly<00:04:07.180> how<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:08.140> apply<00:04:08.830> them<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.160> to

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
you exactly how to apply them to to

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.150 
you exactly how to apply them to to
fiddle<00:04:09.940> tunes<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.540> things<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.160> or

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
fiddle tunes and things like this or

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.740 
fiddle tunes and things like this or
your<00:04:12.520> other<00:04:12.670> playing<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.300> if<00:04:13.510> you're<00:04:13.630> having

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
any timing troubles this is the secret

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.710 
any timing troubles this is the secret
to<00:04:17.410> fixing<00:04:17.709> them<00:04:17.859> up<00:04:18.120> getting<00:04:19.120> your<00:04:19.209> body<00:04:19.390> in

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
together and and we're in 4/4 time with

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.450 
together and and we're in 4/4 time with
most<00:04:49.660> of<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:49.930> lesson<00:04:50.169> you'll<00:04:51.160> even<00:04:51.310> notice

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
most of this lesson you'll even notice

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.090 
most of this lesson you'll even notice
in<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:52.030> know<00:04:52.150> groups<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.720> four<00:04:55.830> that's<00:04:56.830> sort

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
in you know groups of four that's sort

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.070 
in you know groups of four that's sort
of<00:04:57.190> it's<00:04:57.700> still<00:04:57.910> got<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> I'll<00:04:58.510> try<00:04:58.750> kick<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
of it's still got a I'll try kick the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.809
