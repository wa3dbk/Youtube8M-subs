K's<00:00:33.410> technology<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:34.980> saying<00:00:35.340> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
K's technology like I'm not saying that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.350 
K's technology like I'm not saying that
it's<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.360> 2k<00:00:37.399> football<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:39.180> what

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it's going to be 2k football but what

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's going to be 2k football but what
I'm<00:00:39.480> saying<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.640> technology<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I'm saying is that the technology that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.790 
I'm saying is that the technology that
they're<00:00:42.930> using<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:44.420> basically<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:46.020> if

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
they're using is basically that as if

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.549 
they're using is basically that as if
they<00:00:47.010> basically<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:48.329> taking<00:00:49.050> directly

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
they basically are now taking directly

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
they basically are now taking directly
from<00:00:49.770> 2<00:00:50.039> k's<00:00:50.309> playbook<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:53.030> using<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> same

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
from 2 k's playbook and using the same

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
from 2 k's playbook and using the same
mocap<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.890> except<00:00:56.520> they're<00:00:56.699> just

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
mocap that they use except they're just

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750 
mocap that they use except they're just
making<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:58.640> adjustments<00:00:59.640> and

so<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> spun<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:15.970> see<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.530> spun

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
so I spun as you can see I spun

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.820 
so I spun as you can see I spun
completely<00:02:18.250> clear<00:02:19.150> out<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.450> his<00:02:19.690> path<00:02:19.990> he

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
completely clear out of his path he

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.910 
completely clear out of his path he
didn't<00:02:21.250> get<00:02:21.400> sucked<00:02:21.730> into<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.410> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
didn't get sucked into know it to you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.460 
didn't get sucked into know it to you
didn't<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.310> sucked<00:02:24.580> into<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.060> into<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.170> slot

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
didn't get sucked into the into the slot

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.230 
didn't get sucked into the into the slot
machine<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.160> animations<00:02:27.790> or<00:02:27.880> anything<00:02:28.210> like

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
machine of animations or anything like

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.620 
machine of animations or anything like
that<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:30.640> he<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.390> position

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
that but because he was out of position

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.160 
that but because he was out of position
he<00:02:32.560> had<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.950> plant<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.750> how<00:02:34.960> they're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
he had to plant just like how they're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.320 
he had to plant just like how they're
talking<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.860> locomotion<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.760> much<00:02:36.970> he<00:02:37.150> had

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
talking up the locomotion so much he had

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.720 
talking up the locomotion so much he had
to<00:02:37.450> play<00:02:37.690> his<00:02:37.960> feet<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.440> come<00:02:38.950> back<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.520> make<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
to play his feet and come back to make a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.020 
to play his feet and come back to make a
play<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.020> he<00:02:41.830> he<00:02:42.130> recognized<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.850> play

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
play but then he he recognized to play

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.540 
play but then he he recognized to play
computer<00:02:43.720> recognizes<00:02:44.140> play<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:44.950> over<00:02:45.100> and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
computer recognizes play was over and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.870 
computer recognizes play was over and
then<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.110> said<00:02:47.260> once<00:02:47.650> again<00:02:48.010> realistic

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
then like I said once again realistic

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.420 
then like I said once again realistic
slow<00:02:49.120> down<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:49.600> like<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.020> would<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
slow down just like you would see on the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.750 
slow down just like you would see on the
field<00:02:51.760> or<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.840> any<00:02:53.080> real<00:02:53.440> game<00:02:53.770> realistically

field or in any real game realistically

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.020 
field or in any real game realistically
slow<00:02:55.209> him<00:02:55.360> down<00:02:55.390> there<00:02:56.550> just<00:02:57.550> like<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:57.910> you

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
slow him down there just like if you

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.840 
slow him down there just like if you
look<00:02:58.300> at<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.510> tackle<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.230> was<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.850> player

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
sees it he has the momentum cuz I'm

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.229 
sees it he has the momentum cuz I'm
still<00:03:05.110> stuck<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> spin<00:03:06.100> I'm<00:03:06.370> still<00:03:06.640> coming
