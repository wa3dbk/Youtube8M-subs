00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
he's done for the mission I don't think

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.239 
he's done for the mission I don't think
that<00:05:03.090> this<00:05:03.659> qualifies<00:05:03.990> us<00:05:04.529> from<00:05:04.740> using<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:05.249 
that this qualifies us from using the

that this qualifies us from using the
rest<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.669> campaign<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.210> don't<00:05:06.479> even<00:05:06.659> think

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
rest of the campaign I don't even think

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.149 
rest of the campaign I don't even think
we<00:05:06.870> use<00:05:07.139> in<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.439> rest<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.740> campaign<00:05:10.159> we

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159
