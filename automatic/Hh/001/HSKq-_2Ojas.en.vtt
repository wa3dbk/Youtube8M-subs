quilling<00:00:06.490> is<00:00:06.700> the<00:00:06.910> art<00:00:07.180> of<00:00:07.450> rolling<00:00:08.350> and

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
quilling is the art of rolling and

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.830 
quilling is the art of rolling and
shaping<00:00:09.040> paper<00:00:09.340> strips<00:00:09.879> to<00:00:10.330> get<00:00:10.570> different

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
shaping paper strips to get different

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.890 
shaping paper strips to get different
designs<00:00:11.379> in<00:00:11.680> our<00:00:12.309> previous<00:00:12.699> class<00:00:13.000> we<00:00:13.629> learned

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
designs in our previous class we learned

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.890 
designs in our previous class we learned
to<00:00:14.199> make<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.559> concentric<00:00:15.100> circle<00:00:15.610> rules<00:00:15.900> now

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
to make the concentric circle rules now

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.670 
to make the concentric circle rules now
we<00:00:16.960> will<00:00:17.260> make<00:00:17.440> a<00:00:17.710> sunflower<00:00:18.390> using<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.410> leaf

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
we will make a sunflower using the leaf

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.610 
we will make a sunflower using the leaf
shaped<00:00:21.280> code<00:00:21.880> let<00:00:22.780> us<00:00:22.930> learn<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.230> make<00:00:23.470> the

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
shaped code let us learn to make the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.340 
shaped code let us learn to make the
leaf<00:00:23.800> shaped<00:00:24.100> coil<00:00:24.430> you<00:00:25.240> take<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.510> yellow<00:00:25.930> strip

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
leaf shaped coil you take a yellow strip

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.000 
leaf shaped coil you take a yellow strip
and<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:28.360> first<00:00:28.690> step<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.530> make<00:00:29.740> a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
and the first step is to make a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.029 
and the first step is to make a
concentric<00:00:30.640> circle<00:00:31.060> roll<00:00:31.270> so<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.259> use<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> thin

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
concentric circle roll so you use a thin

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.010 
concentric circle roll so you use a thin
brush<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.699> rule<00:00:34.329> it<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:35.710> best<00:00:35.980> that<00:00:36.160> you<00:00:36.310> use

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
brush to rule it is best that you use

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920 
brush to rule it is best that you use
your<00:00:38.020> index<00:00:38.950> finger<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.430> thumb<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:40.510> rule<00:00:40.690> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
your index finger and thumb to rule the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:57.230 
your index finger and thumb to rule the
strip<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.760> easier<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.450> faster

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.370 

now<00:00:58.240> you<00:00:59.020> let<00:00:59.230> this<00:00:59.470> role<00:00:59.800> unfold<00:01:00.490> a<00:01:00.610> little<00:01:01.380> so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
now you let this role unfold a little so

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.990 
now you let this role unfold a little so
that<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:02.740> get<00:01:02.950> a<00:01:03.130> loose<00:01:03.400> oval<00:01:04.050> like<00:01:05.050> this<00:01:06.000> next

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
that we get a loose oval like this next

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.380 
that we get a loose oval like this next
you<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:08.020> to<00:01:08.050> press<00:01:08.620> this<00:01:08.950> rule<00:01:09.340> from<00:01:10.060> both

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
you have to press this rule from both

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.790 
you have to press this rule from both
the<00:01:10.630> sides<00:01:10.960> like<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:13.080> shape<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.350> into<00:01:14.620> a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
the sides like this and shape it into a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.200 
the sides like this and shape it into a
leaf

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:33.690 

you<00:01:22.780> can<00:01:22.990> paste<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:24.310> corner

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.940 

and<00:01:33.790> your<00:01:34.450> leaf<00:01:34.659> shaped<00:01:35.049> girl<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.850> ready<00:01:40.950> make

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
and your leaf shaped girl is ready make

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.730 
and your leaf shaped girl is ready make
more<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.369> these<00:01:42.610> leaf<00:01:42.970> shaped<00:01:43.360> curls<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.140> keep

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
more of these leaf shaped curls and keep

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.910 
more of these leaf shaped curls and keep
them<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.970> will<00:01:46.149> start<00:01:46.450> making<00:01:46.540> our<00:01:47.020> flower<00:01:47.350> by

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
them we will start making our flower by

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.789 
them we will start making our flower by
making<00:01:48.340> its<00:01:48.549> center<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:50.049> make<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> center<00:01:50.710> of

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
making its center to make the center of

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.310 
making its center to make the center of
the<00:01:50.950> flower<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.580> take<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> dark<00:01:52.509> brown<00:01:52.630> strip

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
the flower you take a dark brown strip

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:13.910 
the flower you take a dark brown strip
and<00:01:53.880> roll<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.030> into<00:01:55.240> a<00:01:55.390> circle<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.930> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.740 

is<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.849> edge<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.750> make<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.200> ring
