much<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> much<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
much use this much just because my

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.600 
much use this much just because my
binder<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> bigger<00:01:09.360> than<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
binder is bigger than this and like it's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.039 
binder is bigger than this and like it's
taller<00:01:11.880> than<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> hard<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
taller than it so it's kind of hard to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
taller than it so it's kind of hard to
get<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.439> fast<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.000> me<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> find<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
get it out fast so for me I find it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.490 
get it out fast so for me I find it
easier<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.320> go<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:18.380> open<00:01:19.380> it

easier to just go in like this open it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.969 
easier to just go in like this open it
up<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> buckles<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> unsnap

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979
