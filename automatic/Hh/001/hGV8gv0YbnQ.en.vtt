00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.900
 hello youtube friends this video this 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.300
 I hope I can help you 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.940
 this I bought this gun the batteries 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.150
 in some jobs in my house but from 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.650
 suddenly the gun my family home 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 he started having this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.199
 to present failures in the pressure this one 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.110
 He was much closer to the track 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.520
 wall to paint and did not know why 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.040
 it happened I thought that she 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 it had broken down this look for the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 page d 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.180
 the information of how 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.880
 so I 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 I started to see the gun here and now 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.120
 I discovered what is the fault what we have 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.120
 what to do is 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.250
 open the gun 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.530
 and that inside 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.539
 we see this a part 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.309
 plastic black color that is up to 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.909
 background to that part we're going to get it out with 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.829
 some tweezers 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.730
 can give off any problem in this 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.540
 punch 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.120
 and after that what we are going to do is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 clean it because that's where it accumulates 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.840
 the painting 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.360
 and what's going on 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.600
 every time we occupy our gun 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.990
 then we are going to remove the piece and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 we continue 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.520
 well we already take the piece is this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.820
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.570
 as you can see here this part has 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.570
 here as 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 a bulge 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.420
 and this we are going to separate it from this body 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.530
 complete here this is 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.380
 in the middle of the division we are going to take it out 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.870
 very carefully trying to make it 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 here where 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.780
 you see this mark we are not going to win it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.960
 this because it can break we're going to 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.960
 do 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 well we have already separated the pieces 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.370
 they see in this way how unique we are going to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.320
 to do is to clean them and with that our 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.080
 gun will be the first time 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.060
 we use it with a lot of power every time 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.600
 that they are covered or that they can not be 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.970
 working well let's do the same 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.660
 It was already beginning to work. I hope they were 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 liked the video
