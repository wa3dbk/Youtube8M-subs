00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you if you want to I will just try that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.460 
you if you want to I will just try that
out<00:02:44.130> real<00:02:44.370> quick<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.570> do<00:02:45.690> dismiss<00:02:46.170> delay

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
out real quick you can do dismiss delay

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.220 
out real quick you can do dismiss delay
which<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.830> how<00:02:47.040> slow<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:48.000> goes<00:02:48.300> away<00:02:48.480> after<00:02:48.900> you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
which is how slow it goes away after you

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.800 
which is how slow it goes away after you
activate<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.730> size<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
activate it and then we have size and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.480 
activate it and then we have size and
none<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.200> these<00:02:52.320> require<00:02:52.680> respring<00:02:53.160> switch<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
none of these require respring switch is

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.250 
none of these require respring switch is
pretty<00:02:53.730> cool<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.150> generally<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.140> about

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
pretty cool I generally like that about

so<00:04:16.950> instead<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.220> checking<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.669> weather<00:04:17.790> app

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
so instead of checking the weather app

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.690 
so instead of checking the weather app
you<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.900> turn<00:04:19.739> your<00:04:19.919> phone<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.609> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
can see the top there I have partly

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.500 
can see the top there I have partly
cloudy<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.490> then<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.640> know<00:04:23.729> it's<00:04:23.910> partly<00:04:24.180> cloudy

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510
