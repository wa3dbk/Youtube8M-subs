00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
probably wondering what this black

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
probably wondering what this black
rectangle<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> we've<00:02:23.340> gotten<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> few

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
rectangle is and we've gotten a few

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.020 
rectangle is and we've gotten a few
emails<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:25.110> our<00:02:25.380> customers<00:02:26.100> asking<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.910> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
emails from our customers asking what it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.060 
emails from our customers asking what it
is<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.110> part<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> case<00:02:28.740> and

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
is and if it's a part of the case and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.150 
is and if it's a part of the case and
it's<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.270> filler<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.140> case<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.890> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
it's just a filler for the case so it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280 
it's just a filler for the case so it
can<00:02:32.280> give<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.490> some<00:02:32.520> support<00:02:32.820> whenever<00:02:33.420> it's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
can give it some support whenever it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440 
can give it some support whenever it's
in<00:02:34.500> transit<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.280> being<00:02:35.760> shipped<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.270> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
in transit and being shipped to you so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.160 
in transit and being shipped to you so
it<00:02:36.540> doesn't<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:37.590> all<00:02:37.740> warped<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:39.210> transit

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it doesn't get all warped and in transit

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.800 
it doesn't get all warped and in transit
so<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.460> for<00:02:41.610> support<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.300> -<00:02:42.660> when

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
so that's just for support so - when

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.440 
so that's just for support so - when
putting<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.260> iPad<00:02:43.740> Mini<00:02:43.980> inside<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:45.030> need<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
putting the iPad Mini inside you need to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.500 
putting the iPad Mini inside you need to
take<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:47.970> do

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
take this out and so I'm going to do

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.170 
take this out and so I'm going to do
that<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.920> slips<00:02:50.760> out<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:52.580> that's<00:02:53.580> where<00:02:53.940> you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that it slips out and that's where you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.680 
that it slips out and that's where you
put<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.750> iPad<00:02:55.140> Mini<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> put<00:02:57.570> it

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
put the iPad Mini so I'm going to put it

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:09.980 
put the iPad Mini so I'm going to put it
in<00:03:02.480> slides<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:09.120> made<00:03:09.420> from<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.750> really

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
in slides in it's made from a really

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.500 
in slides in it's made from a really
durable<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.500> flexible<00:03:10.680> material<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.090> don't

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
durable and flexible material so I don't

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.070 
durable and flexible material so I don't
have<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.750> worry<00:03:13.020> about<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:14.640> breaking<00:03:18.080> and

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
have to worry about it breaking and

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.830 
have to worry about it breaking and
there<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.410> goes<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:20.010> fits<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.580> there<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.570> looks

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
there it goes it fits in there it looks

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.860 
there it goes it fits in there it looks
really<00:03:22.170> cool<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:24.740> handle<00:03:26.390> turns<00:03:27.390> into<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
really cool the handle turns into a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.610 
really cool the handle turns into a
stand<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:29.360> that's<00:03:30.360> very<00:03:30.720> convenient<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
stand and that's very convenient and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.190 
stand and that's very convenient and
then<00:03:31.920> let<00:03:32.490> me<00:03:32.610> show<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.910> what's<00:03:33.540> outwits

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
control and the power button is kind of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.000 
control and the power button is kind of
hidden<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.900> here<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.440> little<00:03:46.560> bit<00:03:46.709> covered

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
hidden up here it's a little bit covered

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.800 
hidden up here it's a little bit covered
it's<00:03:47.310> kind<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.700> little<00:03:47.940> bit<00:03:48.090> more<00:03:48.120> difficult

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
it's kind of a little bit more difficult

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500 
it's kind of a little bit more difficult
to<00:03:48.930> access<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.670> really<00:03:50.910> because<00:03:51.239> it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
to access but not really because it's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.180 
to access but not really because it's
it's<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> way<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.800> case<00:03:52.980> is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
it's there but just the way the case is

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.210 
it's there but just the way the case is
made<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:54.300> case<00:03:54.630> covers<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.350> power<00:03:55.950> button

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
made the case covers the power button

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
made the case covers the power button
just<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.459> little<00:03:56.670> bit<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.180> still<00:03:57.420> it's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
just a little bit but it's still it's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.960 
just a little bit but it's still it's
still<00:03:58.680> accessible<00:03:58.980> just<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.489> little<00:03:59.700> bit<00:03:59.820> more

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
still accessible just a little bit more

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.060 
still accessible just a little bit more
difficult<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.480> find<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.440> then<00:04:01.680> we've<00:04:01.950> also

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
difficult to find and then we've also

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.270 
difficult to find and then we've also
left<00:04:02.459> little<00:04:02.700> holes<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.900> speaker<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
left little holes for the speaker so the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.550 
left little holes for the speaker so the
sound<00:04:05.670> will<00:04:05.850> come<00:04:06.090> through<00:04:06.270> easy<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.930> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
sound will come through easy and a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.920 
sound will come through easy and a
little<00:04:07.739> flap<00:04:08.270> covers<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.510> power<00:04:10.489> or<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
little flap covers the power or the the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.880 
little flap covers the power or the the
a<00:04:13.580> little<00:04:14.580> flap<00:04:14.820> covers<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.690> charging<00:04:16.620> port

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
a little flap covers the charging port

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.039 
a little flap covers the charging port
and<00:04:17.130> that's<00:04:18.030> been<00:04:19.020> convenient<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.870> here<00:04:21.870> is

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and that's been convenient and here is
