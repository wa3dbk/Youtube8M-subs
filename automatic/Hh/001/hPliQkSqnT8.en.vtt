 chivas to do things well do 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 many goals in the institution of 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.520
 Guadalajara but good now I'm

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.090
 day you can go back to Guadalajara and do 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.820
 many goals for chivas from her as 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.700
 will face bolivia marco tomorrow I 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.410
 I think with the same essence that we have 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 I've been working with Miguel, I think that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.310
 we have understood your concept very well 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.980
 you have to lower the attitude intensity 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.720
 that has been shown and we have the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.610
 quality within those on the court 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.440
 colors that we are to be able to 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.690
 specify the goals that were needed 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.459
 with chile and good to win the game 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.220
 how many bases are you going to put in the bucket 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.020
 tomorrow, he left and we 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.870
 we know well then I will try to 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.880
 that is his debut dreamed of goal what 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.300
 that I remember I remember a classic in the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.520
 Aztec 31 30 I think eric was 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.069
 very well and with fabian frame passes and 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.590
 nothing always 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.230
 I understand very well is a player who 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.359
 we know we have been able to share 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.329
 field and well let's hope that tomorrow 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.329
 let's go online that they wanted 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.189
 spaces above that we can specify 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.579
 plays and good the most important thing to be 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.409
 blunt and make goals that is how 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.389
 we will win match not only debut 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.459
 exactly but also make the goal 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.139
 what are you doing lml there is a 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.810
 punishment that goes through but you're 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:51.290
 doing and I'm happy 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.660
 why they have dropped the goals I had 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.300
 minutes I had continuity that is what 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.860
 that what every player wants and good 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.310
 I hope I hope tomorrow 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.810
 first god to be able to debut and 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.660
 as soon as the team wins yes yes I can 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.519
 scoring goals would be something extraordinary 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.870
 the best of luck for both and I 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.569
 I have to get out of the way because I 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.150
 you have to give the kick of debut 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.090
 he made the water if they want to where 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 fall but but you have to give it your your 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.739
 debut this symbolically in selection 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.739
 national did not dial to see he was commissioned 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.540
 the fabian frame kick for the bucket 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.820
 towers to whom we thank you for the time 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.860
 and what is your forecast tomorrow 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.289
 the triumph but the forecast 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.479
 let's win I do not know how many goals fall 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.969
 I hope they are many but we are thinking about 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.550
 win we're going to win as long as there's that 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.259
 win good we said goodbye to the bucket and 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.259
