you've<00:00:00.299> spent<00:00:00.630> even<00:00:01.199> drawings<00:00:01.740> all<00:00:02.340> eight

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
you've spent even drawings all eight

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.370 
you've spent even drawings all eight
years<00:00:03.389> you've<00:00:03.540> never<00:00:03.689> got<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> better<00:00:04.080> people

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
years you've never got a better people

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.039 
years you've never got a better people
are<00:00:04.470> you've<00:00:04.589> sketched<00:00:04.890> although<00:00:05.839> all<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.930> got

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
are you've sketched although all you got

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.459 
are you've sketched although all you got
do<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> how<00:00:10.200> does<00:00:10.260> that

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
do now is make it so so how does that

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.640 
do now is make it so so how does that
work<00:00:10.679> because<00:00:11.690> that<00:00:12.690> must<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.019> there<00:00:13.259> there

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
work because that must be there there

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.530 
work because that must be there there
must<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> easy<00:00:14.130> part<00:00:14.250> right<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
must be the easy part right because the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.990 
must be the easy part right because the
hard<00:00:15.690> part<00:00:15.929> must<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.289> drawn<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.650> hmm<00:00:17.460> well<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
hard part must be drawn it hmm well I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
hard part must be drawn it hmm well I
don't<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.080> people<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.619> are

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
don't think that the people that are

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.480 
don't think that the people that are
helping<00:00:20.010> me<00:00:20.130> make<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.490> would<00:00:20.730> probably<00:00:20.970> agree

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
helping me make it would probably agree

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.550 
helping me make it would probably agree
it's<00:00:23.490> actually<00:00:23.750> turned<00:00:24.750> out<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it's actually turned out to be the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
it's actually turned out to be the
hardest<00:00:26.039> computer-generated<00:00:26.910> model<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hardest computer-generated model that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130 
hardest computer-generated model that
we've<00:00:28.050> ever<00:00:28.199> created<00:00:28.609> mm-hmm<00:00:29.609> why<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.660> very

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
we've ever created mm-hmm why is very

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
we've ever created mm-hmm why is very
complicated<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.309> obviously<00:00:32.640> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
complicated because you obviously you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
complicated because you obviously you
make<00:00:33.660> jewellery<00:00:33.899> hey<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:34.829> make

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
make jewellery hey you don't make

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
make jewellery hey you don't make
whiskey<00:00:35.399> buckets<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> fuss

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
whiskey buckets so this is this a fuss

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.420 
whiskey buckets so this is this a fuss
for<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.710> before<00:00:37.800> I've

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for you if you done this before I've

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.680 
for you if you done this before I've
never<00:00:38.670> done<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> whiskey<00:00:39.120> bottle<00:00:39.390> no<00:00:40.850> but<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
never done a whiskey bottle no but the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.440 
never done a whiskey bottle no but the
process<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.590> very<00:00:43.950> similar<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.180> glass

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
process is very similar and the glass

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.110 
process is very similar and the glass
really<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.739> side<00:00:47.129> creation<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
really is a side creation of what we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.740 
really is a side creation of what we
make<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.200> cage<00:00:49.730> metal<00:00:50.730> effect<00:00:51.059> anyway<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
make of the cage metal effect anyway so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
make of the cage metal effect anyway so
it<00:00:51.899> should<00:00:52.379> technically<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.520> quite

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it should technically all be quite

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
it should technically all be quite
straightforward<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.350> into<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
straightforward but when we got into the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
straightforward but when we got into the
model<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.550> you've<00:00:56.760> seen<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> pictures

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
model as you've seen in the pictures

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
model as you've seen in the pictures
it's<00:00:57.870> got<00:00:58.050> lots<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.530> strands<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.250> crossing

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's got lots of strands all crossing

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
it's got lots of strands all crossing
over<00:00:59.789> each<00:01:00.030> other<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> winding<00:01:00.870> under<00:01:01.260> round

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
over each other and winding under round

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.030 
over each other and winding under round
things<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.820> different<00:01:03.449> layers<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
things and the different layers and the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.350 
things and the different layers and the
writing<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:05.939> different<00:01:06.150> things

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
writing and all these different things

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.830 
writing and all these different things
so<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> create<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.670> precise<00:01:09.090> model

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so to create that in a precise model

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.679 
so to create that in a precise model
that<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.650> production<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that will work for production and then

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.810 
that will work for production and then
be<00:01:13.080> hand<00:01:13.320> finished<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.979> an<00:01:14.189> object<00:01:14.340> that's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
be hand finished around an object that's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
be hand finished around an object that's
slightly<00:01:15.150> changing<00:01:15.780> every<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> pops<00:01:16.500> out

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
slightly changing every time it pops out

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.730 
slightly changing every time it pops out
such<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.340> glass<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.360> very<00:01:19.140> difficult<00:01:19.409> thing

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
such as glass is a very difficult thing

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.219 
such as glass is a very difficult thing
to<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:20.040> well<00:01:20.600> you're<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.659> feeling<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.049> full<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to do well you're not feeling me full of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.700 
to do well you're not feeling me full of
confidence<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:24.180> say<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> should

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
confidence you say you see it you should

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
confidence you say you see it you should
be<00:01:25.740> feeling<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:26.070> pull<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
be feeling me pull away so you see it so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
be feeling me pull away so you see it so
that<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.869> enfili<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.890> this

that it's enfili this you know this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.410 
that it's enfili this you know this
should<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.390> a

should all work so we want to go a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600 
should all work so we want to go a
couple<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> months<00:01:33.930> before<00:01:34.530> lunch<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.400> lunch

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it'll work with metal it's always

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.960 
it'll work with metal it's always
fixable<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.110> always<00:01:43.560> finish<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.250> um<00:01:44.490> it's

such<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> moving<00:01:45.630> changing<00:01:46.320> organism<00:01:47.159> it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
such a moving changing organism it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.660 
such a moving changing organism it's
metal<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.240> me<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.540> almost<00:01:48.630> alive<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
metal to me it's almost alive and you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
metal to me it's almost alive and you
can<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.970> anything<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.229> not

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
can do anything to it so I'm not

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
can do anything to it so I'm not
concerned<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> quality<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
concerned and the quality of the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.670

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
don't always work about me but we we

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.190 
don't always work about me but we we
have<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> work<00:02:36.810> directly<00:02:36.990> with<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:38.460> computer

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have I work directly with a computer

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.960 
have I work directly with a computer
created<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> cad<00:02:40.920> cad<00:02:41.400> person<00:02:41.850> who

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
created like a cad cad person who

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.240 
created like a cad cad person who
creates<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.540> model<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.860> work<00:02:44.040> very

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
creates that model and we work very

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.730 
creates that model and we work very
closely<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> daily<00:02:45.390> basis<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.990> every<00:02:46.290> aspect

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
closely on a daily basis of every aspect

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.660 
closely on a daily basis of every aspect
and<00:02:47.670> he<00:02:47.880> basically<00:02:48.240> scans<00:02:48.990> in<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.410> drawing<00:02:49.710> to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and he basically scans in my drawing to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.640 
and he basically scans in my drawing to
3d<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.570> then<00:02:51.690> starts<00:02:52.050> building<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> line

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
3d and then starts building the line

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
3d and then starts building the line
work<00:02:52.830> around<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.180> then<00:02:54.420> slowly<00:02:54.660> but

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
work around that and then slowly but

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.530 
work around that and then slowly but
surely<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.740> comes<00:02:55.980> 3d<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.850> then<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.420> have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
surely it comes 3d and then you have

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.510 
surely it comes 3d and then you have
lots<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> choices<00:02:58.080> about<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.100> said<00:02:59.280> where

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
lots of choices about like I said where

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280 
lots of choices about like I said where
lines<00:02:59.760> cross<00:03:00.030> over<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.390> how<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.870> actual

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
lines cross over and how the actual

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590 
lines cross over and how the actual
thing<00:03:01.320> comes<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.830> life<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.970> then<00:03:03.390> how<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
thing comes to life and then how the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360 
thing comes to life and then how the
joinings<00:03:04.170> will<00:03:04.380> look<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.860> where<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> little

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
joinings will look and where the little

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.310 
joinings will look and where the little
connector<00:03:06.180> points<00:03:06.510> will<00:03:06.690> be<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.050> how<00:03:07.170> you'll

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
connector points will be and how you'll

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.440 
connector points will be and how you'll
finish<00:03:07.530> all<00:03:07.800> these<00:03:07.920> details<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.640> those<00:03:09.150> things

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
finish all these details so those things

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.030 
finish all these details so those things
for<00:03:09.840> something<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.470> where<00:03:10.770> it's<00:03:10.890> such

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
for something like this where it's such

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.720 
for something like this where it's such
a<00:03:11.070> unique<00:03:11.540> vision<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:12.960> me<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
for a better understand what the whiskey

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.259 
for a better understand what the whiskey
was<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> bite<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.550> flying<00:03:56.850> around<00:03:57.060> or

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
was a bite was like flying around or

inspiration or is it good official they
come<00:04:00.989> down<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> hard<00:04:01.830> bit<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.130> end

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
come down to the hard bit at the end

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.280 
come down to the hard bit at the end
where<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.120> better<00:04:03.480> glass<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.050> moves

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
where you have a better glass that moves

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.080 
where you have a better glass that moves
a<00:04:04.560> bit<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.860> metal<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.220> moves<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:05.850> plan

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
a bit of metal that moves and then plan

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.630 
a bit of metal that moves and then plan
to<00:04:06.180> get<00:04:06.330> every<00:04:06.750> single<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.739> just

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
to get every single one to be just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
to get every single one to be just
perfect<00:04:09.120> mm-hmm<00:04:09.810> what's<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.140> bit<00:04:10.290> well<00:04:10.620> i

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
perfect mm-hmm what's the bit well i

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.670 
perfect mm-hmm what's the bit well i
think<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.610> stage<00:04:11.940> where<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.600> most<00:04:12.870> lose

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
think the stage where it can most lose

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.740 
think the stage where it can most lose
your<00:04:14.340> dream<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:15.000> what<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.239> want<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.630> look

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
your dream of what you want it to look

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.120 
your dream of what you want it to look
like<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:16.049> definitely<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.500> translation<00:04:17.040> from

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
like is definitely the translation from

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.970 
like is definitely the translation from
paper<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.519> model<00:04:18.019> but<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.470> taken<00:04:19.890> us

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
paper to model but that is taken us

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.380 
paper to model but that is taken us
about<00:04:20.190> six<00:04:20.459> times<00:04:20.640> longer<00:04:20.940> than<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.269> planned

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
about six times longer than we planned

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.409 
about six times longer than we planned
it<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:22.289> it<00:04:22.590> worked<00:04:23.280> out<00:04:23.430> perfectly<00:04:23.850> so

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
it to be but it worked out perfectly so

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.570 
it to be but it worked out perfectly so
that<00:04:24.660> stage<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.200> now<00:04:25.320> conquered<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.310> neck

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
that stage is now conquered and the neck

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.700 
that stage is now conquered and the neck
stages<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.180> definitely<00:04:27.599> the<00:04:28.080> next<00:04:28.319> hardest

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
stages to definitely the next hardest

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.129 
stages to definitely the next hardest
stage<00:04:28.889> is<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.220> get<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:30.330> all<00:04:30.810> come<00:04:30.840> together

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
stage is to get it to all come together

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.409 
stage is to get it to all come together
but<00:04:31.860> I've<00:04:32.009> no<00:04:32.490> qualms<00:04:32.849> that<00:04:32.970> will<00:04:33.090> make<00:04:33.240> that

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
but I've no qualms that will make that

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.149 
but I've no qualms that will make that
absolutely<00:04:33.569> perfect<00:04:34.289> so<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.740> comes<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.069> to

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
absolutely perfect so it comes in to

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.260 
absolutely perfect so it comes in to
polishing<00:04:35.520> how<00:04:35.699> long<00:04:35.879> does<00:04:35.939> it<00:04:36.030> take<00:04:36.240> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
polishing how long does it take to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.540 
polishing how long does it take to
physically<00:04:36.810> polish<00:04:37.439> one<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.650> these<00:04:37.770> things<00:04:37.979> it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
physically polish one of these things it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.279 
physically polish one of these things it
takes<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.909> long<00:04:39.060> time<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.629> probably<00:04:39.990> takes<00:04:40.139> a

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
takes a long time it probably takes a

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.529 
takes a long time it probably takes a
day<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.710> make<00:04:40.979> each<00:04:41.159> piece<00:04:41.389> because<00:04:42.389> they

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
day to make each piece because they

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:43.999 
day to make each piece because they
because<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> color<00:04:43.229> that's<00:04:43.379> involved<00:04:43.830> I

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
because the color that's involved I

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.559 
because the color that's involved I
suppose<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.550> must<00:04:44.639> be<00:04:44.819> very<00:04:44.849> difficult<00:04:45.090> to

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
suppose it must be very difficult to

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.890 
suppose it must be very difficult to
make<00:04:46.169> sure<00:04:46.349> that<00:04:46.530> there's<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:47.729> know

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
make sure that there's that you know

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.330 
make sure that there's that you know
almost<00:04:48.900> consistency<00:04:49.590> appreciate<00:04:49.979> everyone's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
almost consistency appreciate everyone's

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.230 
almost consistency appreciate everyone's
going<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:50.610> different<00:04:50.939> but<00:04:51.000> you're<00:04:51.120> gonna

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
going to be different but you're gonna

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.510 
going to be different but you're gonna
it's<00:04:51.509> gonna<00:04:51.960> be<00:04:52.110> quick<00:04:52.259> quick<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:53.370> can't

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
it's gonna be quick quick I just can't

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.800 
it's gonna be quick quick I just can't
imagine<00:04:53.729> how<00:04:53.969> that<00:04:54.120> would<00:04:54.240> work<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.539> mean<00:04:54.689> it

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
imagine how that would work I mean it

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.990 
imagine how that would work I mean it
well<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.379> beauty<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.889> it<00:04:56.009> is<00:04:56.159> it's<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.849> limited

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
well the beauty of it is it's a limited

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.119 
well the beauty of it is it's a limited
edition<00:04:57.240> series<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:58.229> completely<00:04:58.500> hand

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
edition series so it's completely hand

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.920 
edition series so it's completely hand
finished<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.639> every<00:05:00.030> piece<00:05:00.270> will<00:05:00.900> be

finished and every piece will be

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.540 
finished and every piece will be
slightly<00:05:01.259> different<00:05:01.800> because<00:05:02.250> it's

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
slightly different because it's

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.240 
slightly different because it's
handcrafted<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:04.080> there's<00:05:04.620> no<00:05:04.770> way<00:05:04.949> that<00:05:05.129> it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
handcrafted and there's no way that it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.920 
handcrafted and there's no way that it

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.050 
would be consistent with the next bottle
so<00:05:07.530> for<00:05:07.860> me<00:05:07.979> that's<00:05:08.159> the<00:05:08.370> beauty<00:05:08.669> of<00:05:08.699> a<00:05:08.879> piece

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
so for me that's the beauty of a piece

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.399 
so for me that's the beauty of a piece
that's<00:05:09.180> very<00:05:09.449> similar<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.020> way<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.259> we

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
that's very similar to the way that we

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.529 
that's very similar to the way that we
create<00:05:10.710> jewelry<00:05:10.949> so<00:05:11.520> no<00:05:11.759> two<00:05:11.819> pieces<00:05:12.150> are<00:05:12.449> the

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
create jewelry so no two pieces are the

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.240 
create jewelry so no two pieces are the
same<00:05:12.569> it's<00:05:12.930> really<00:05:13.259> uniquely<00:05:13.620> your<00:05:13.830> piece<00:05:14.099> so

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
same it's really uniquely your piece so

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.309 
same it's really uniquely your piece so
the<00:05:14.340> one<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:15.060> purchase<00:05:15.539> nobody<00:05:16.169> else

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
the one that you purchase nobody else

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.959 
the one that you purchase nobody else
will<00:05:16.469> have<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.680> piece<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.069> looks<00:05:17.280> identical

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
will have a piece that looks identical

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.909 
will have a piece that looks identical
because<00:05:18.419> we're<00:05:18.810> using<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.169> oxidized<00:05:19.740> finish

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
because we're using this oxidized finish

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.100 
because we're using this oxidized finish
and<00:05:20.279> then<00:05:20.639> rubbing<00:05:20.879> it<00:05:21.090> back<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.690> reveal<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
and then rubbing it back to reveal the

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.409 
and then rubbing it back to reveal the
true<00:05:22.289> color<00:05:22.529> of<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.770> metal<00:05:23.099> and<00:05:24.060> it's<00:05:24.330> a

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
true color of the metal and it's a

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.149 
true color of the metal and it's a
natural<00:05:24.629> state<00:05:25.169> metal<00:05:25.590> which<00:05:25.740> was<00:05:25.919> really

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
natural state metal which was really

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.890 
natural state metal which was really
important<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.639> me<00:05:26.759> to<00:05:26.849> use<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.360> because<00:05:27.599> it

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
important for me to use that because it

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.219 
important for me to use that because it
goes<00:05:28.050> along<00:05:28.169> with<00:05:28.439> Helen<00:05:29.189> parks<00:05:30.020> ideal<00:05:31.020> they

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
goes along with Helen parks ideal they

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.170 
goes along with Helen parks ideal they
never<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:31.650> any<00:05:31.830> caramel<00:05:32.520> added<00:05:32.849> and<00:05:33.029> you

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
never have any caramel added and you

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.600 
never have any caramel added and you
always<00:05:33.599> use<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.870> pure<00:05:34.139> color<00:05:34.409> whiskey<00:05:35.219> so<00:05:35.400> for

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
always use a pure color whiskey so for

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.159 
always use a pure color whiskey so for
me<00:05:35.729> it<00:05:35.849> had<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.120> be<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.240> pure<00:05:36.479> color<00:05:36.690> metal<00:05:36.900> there

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
me it had to be a pure color metal there

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.869 
me it had to be a pure color metal there
was<00:05:37.259> not<00:05:37.409> going<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> be<00:05:37.710> any<00:05:37.830> plating<00:05:38.340> involved

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
was not going to be any plating involved

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.730 
was not going to be any plating involved
there<00:05:39.330> is<00:05:39.419> not<00:05:39.569> going<00:05:39.659> to<00:05:39.750> be<00:05:39.870> any<00:05:40.050> patination

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
there is not going to be any patination

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.709 
there is not going to be any patination
that<00:05:41.009> would<00:05:41.159> change<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:42.000> natural<00:05:42.180> state<00:05:42.659> of

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
that would change the natural state of

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.329 
that would change the natural state of
the<00:05:42.930> metal<00:05:43.080> itself<00:05:43.319> so<00:05:43.680> all<00:05:43.830> we're<00:05:44.009> doing<00:05:44.219> is

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
the metal itself so all we're doing is

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.430 
the metal itself so all we're doing is
blacking<00:05:45.089> it<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.449> blackening<00:05:45.870> it<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.169> it<00:05:46.259> looks

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
blacking it so blackening it so it looks

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.700 
blacking it so blackening it so it looks
aged<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:47.099> then<00:05:47.639> showing<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.569> true<00:05:48.719> lines<00:05:49.379> and

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
aged and then showing the true lines and

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.990 
aged and then showing the true lines and
highlights<00:05:50.129> of<00:05:50.250> that<00:05:50.310> piece<00:05:50.580> coming<00:05:50.789> back

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
highlights of that piece coming back

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820 
highlights of that piece coming back
when<00:05:51.210> we<00:05:51.300> rub<00:05:51.449> it<00:05:51.569> back<00:05:51.719> and<00:05:52.289> we're<00:05:52.440> also<00:05:52.589> going

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
when we rub it back and we're also going

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.279 
when we rub it back and we're also going
to<00:05:52.889> be<00:05:53.009> including<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.819> cloth<00:05:54.509> of<00:05:54.839> polishing
