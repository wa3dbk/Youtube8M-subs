00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 see ordinary ascorbic acid in 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.300
 tablets can be taken in ampoules or for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 for example one small spot us 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 need somewhere 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.490
 half a tablet the whole tablet is not needed if 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.300
 the spot is big then take intact and us her 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 need to crumble 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.730
 if you have a fluid of course it's easier that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 I am not at the moment Khakassia 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.620
 I dissolve in quite a small amount 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.010
 I make a strong solution 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 ascorbic acid is completely necessary 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.150
 dissolve so that the water is clear 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.839
 You formed a spot of iodine on clothing 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.940
 on any clothes of any color can be very 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.310
 easy and simple to remove this stain when 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 aid of ascorbic acid or liquid 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 or tablets 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.649
 now we put on our spot 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.649
 ascorbic acid 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.110
 but will disappear 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 give a little space and stains you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.390
 will not be 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.810
 at all 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.899
 as if there was no after that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.380
 rinse 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.579
 products and there were there and as if and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.110
 there was no trace of course if you have 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.110
 grief for acid is much easier 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:17.400
 now how to remove the stain from zelenka 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.550
 But you need us 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.210
 vinegar and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.440
 lather his cotton swab and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.400
 wetted 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.400
 abundantly 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.840
 our stain is possible even if the stain is large 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:44.660
 some kind there on the carpet or something you can 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.030
 even straight pray no big deal then 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:52.700
 have it soak and minutes 10 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:59.920
 probably lay down well and now we put 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.920
 foam and let's go wash 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.550
 also five minutes to lie down 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.670
 abundantly 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:18.850
 don't spare the foam left a stain on the floor 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.240
 but things do not have anything I'm at 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.240
 first washed with abdominal water from 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.850
 Zelenka and then it again soap can 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.550
 economic anyway the stain will come down 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.370
 see nothing even a hint of the same 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.940
 in the most way 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.610
 I rest with linoleum that is this way 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.240
 Suitable for linoleum carpets for 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.080
 all this right now this is me vinegar and 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.490
 then I last design another 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.050
 soapy water or something similar 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.510
 all again no 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.210
 a little maybe be seen 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.210
 what else was but she will leave
