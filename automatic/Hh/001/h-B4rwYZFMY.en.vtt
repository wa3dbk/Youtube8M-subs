part<00:00:00.299> of<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.450> problem<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:01.170> that<00:00:01.800> it's<00:00:02.040> such<00:00:02.250> an

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
part of the problem is that it's such an

part of the problem is that it's such an
abstract<00:00:02.909> concept<00:00:03.210> try<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.870> talk<00:00:04.140> about<00:00:04.170> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
abstract concept try to talk about the

abstract concept try to talk about the
purpose<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.279> life<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:06.000> general<00:00:06.420> now<00:00:07.109> certainly

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
purpose of life in general now certainly
there<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.460> some<00:00:08.790> benefit<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> trying<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.139> see

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
there is some benefit to trying to see

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.690 
there is some benefit to trying to see
what<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:12.049> common<00:00:13.049> across<00:00:13.230> all<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.040> the

think<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> rightly<00:00:44.129> pointed<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
think is rightly pointed out a kind of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380 
think is rightly pointed out a kind of
common<00:00:46.320> fact<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
common fact of all of this which is the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.490 
common fact of all of this which is the
ability<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.170> replicate<00:00:49.550> itself<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.940> this

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
ability to replicate itself and this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.200 
ability to replicate itself and this
capacity<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.710> replication<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.610> admittedly<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
capacity for replication is admittedly a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.560 
capacity for replication is admittedly a
common<00:00:54.660> purpose<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.620> question<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.309> does<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
common purpose the question is does that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290 
common purpose the question is does that
suffice<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.980> helping<00:00:59.460> us<00:00:59.609> understand<00:01:00.149> the

suffice in helping us understand the

suffice in helping us understand the

common to all cultures is we don't want
to<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.630> lots<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> different<00:01:22.259> cultures

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to look at lots of different cultures

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
to look at lots of different cultures
and<00:01:23.189> then<00:01:23.340> look<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> common<00:01:24.299> thread<00:01:24.540> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and then look for the common thread in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
and then look for the common thread in
it<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:26.040> doing<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.820> best

it all and think by doing so we best

it all and think by doing so we best

is<00:01:30.090> best<00:01:30.360> understood<00:01:30.600> by<00:01:31.229> trying<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is best understood by trying to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.039 
is best understood by trying to
understand<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> range<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> cultural

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
understand the range of the cultural

understand the range of the cultural
differences<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.299> range<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
differences it's the the very range of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
differences it's the the very range of
the<00:01:37.079> differences<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.670> how

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the differences that when we see how

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
the differences that when we see how
differently<00:01:39.540> people<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.229> lived<00:01:40.560> how

differently people have died we see what

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
differently people have died we see what
what<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.579> means<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.970> human<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
what it means to be human I think the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.910 
what it means to be human I think the
same<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.380> could<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.560> said<00:01:46.680> about

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
same thing could be said about

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.300 
same thing could be said about
biodiversity<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:50.070> believe

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
biodiversity now I really do believe

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.460 
biodiversity now I really do believe
that<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> problem<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> would

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that there is a problem and I would

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
that there is a problem and I would
implicate<00:01:52.740> myself<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.729> well<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
implicate myself in this as well in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
implicate myself in this as well in
talking<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.780> animals<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> word

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
talking about animals just the word

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
talking about animals just the word
animals<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.729> organisms<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.930> inclusive

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
animals or organisms it's to inclusive

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
animals or organisms it's to inclusive
it's<00:01:58.710> too<00:01:58.890> abstract<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.610> too<00:01:59.759> broad<00:02:00.000> we

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's too abstract it's too broad we

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's too abstract it's too broad we
don't<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:00.930> talking

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
don't really know what we're talking

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.039 
don't really know what we're talking
about<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.520> almost<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.869> you're

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
about that is it's almost like you're

a kind of understanding we say well

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.339 
a kind of understanding we say well
what's<00:02:14.580> common<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.240> animals<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.080> we<00:02:16.200> can

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
what's common to all animals well we can

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.410 
what's common to all animals well we can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
say replication we say all organisms

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.120 
say replication we say all organisms
that<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.989> has<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.349> common<00:02:19.770> purpose<00:02:20.040> of

that it has this common purpose of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.940 
that it has this common purpose of
replication<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:21.900> what<00:02:22.200> gets<00:02:22.560> missed

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
replication but I think what gets missed

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.559 
replication but I think what gets missed
here<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.810> kinds<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.959> purposes<00:02:25.489> that

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
here is the kinds of purposes that

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.920 
here is the kinds of purposes that
emerge<00:02:27.569> at<00:02:28.250> different<00:02:29.250> levels<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
emerge at different levels of the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
emerge at different levels of the
phylogenetic<00:02:31.410> scale<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:32.910> take

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
phylogenetic scale and so if we take

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.400 
phylogenetic scale and so if we take
just<00:02:33.510> for<00:02:33.690> example<00:02:34.790> something<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.410> plants

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410

it<00:06:59.340> may<00:06:59.490> be<00:06:59.550> an<00:06:59.730> extended<00:07:00.210> purpose<00:07:00.600> of<00:07:00.750> making

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
it may be an extended purpose of making

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.540 
it may be an extended purpose of making
me<00:07:01.140> look<00:07:01.260> civilized<00:07:01.740> I<00:07:01.920> could<00:07:02.100> just<00:07:02.220> feed<00:07:02.400> with

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
me look civilized I could just feed with

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.670 
me look civilized I could just feed with
my<00:07:02.700> hands<00:07:03.150> but<00:07:03.270> I<00:07:03.480> actually<00:07:03.660> I<00:07:03.900> use<00:07:04.140> the<00:07:04.380> fork

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
my hands but I actually I use the fork

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.740 
my hands but I actually I use the fork
to<00:07:05.070> make<00:07:05.220> me<00:07:05.370> look<00:07:05.490> civilized<00:07:06.030> which<00:07:06.300> has<00:07:06.510> some

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
to make me look civilized which has some

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.120 
to make me look civilized which has some
sort<00:07:06.960> of<00:07:07.050> purpose<00:07:07.380> but<00:07:07.650> when<00:07:07.770> i<00:07:07.800> get<00:07:07.980> to<00:07:08.100> the

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
sort of purpose but when i get to the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.430 
sort of purpose but when i get to the
beauty<00:07:08.850> of<00:07:09.120> it<00:07:09.950> beauty<00:07:10.950> is<00:07:11.190> often<00:07:11.580> defined<00:07:11.730> as

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
beauty of it beauty is often defined as

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.290 
beauty of it beauty is often defined as
uselessness<00:07:13.440> that's<00:07:14.340> how<00:07:14.550> you<00:07:14.760> can<00:07:15.000> sort<00:07:15.210> of

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
uselessness that's how you can sort of

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.740 
uselessness that's how you can sort of
differentiate<00:07:16.110> function<00:07:16.920> from<00:07:17.750> aesthetics

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
differentiate function from aesthetics

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.690 
differentiate function from aesthetics
is<00:07:18.990> that<00:07:19.470> the<00:07:19.620> aesthetics<00:07:20.100> don't<00:07:20.400> have<00:07:20.670> a

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
is that the aesthetics don't have a

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.570 
is that the aesthetics don't have a
distinct<00:07:21.660> function<00:07:22.170> again<00:07:22.860> you'd<00:07:23.040> overstate

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
distinct function again you'd overstate

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.310 
distinct function again you'd overstate
that<00:07:23.790> i<00:07:23.850> don't<00:07:24.060> want<00:07:24.180> to<00:07:24.240> get<00:07:24.330> radical<00:07:25.020> on<00:07:25.140> that

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
that i don't want to get radical on that

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.990 
that i don't want to get radical on that
but<00:07:25.470> i<00:07:25.500> think<00:07:25.560> that<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:26.040> perfect<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:26.760> point

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
but i think that the perfect the point

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.220 
but i think that the perfect the point
here<00:07:27.180> is<00:07:27.240> that<00:07:27.360> there<00:07:27.630> do<00:07:27.780> seem<00:07:27.990> to<00:07:28.050> be

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230 
here is that there do seem to be

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.560 
here is that there do seem to be
purposes<00:07:28.830> the<00:07:29.160> purpose<00:07:29.550> of<00:07:29.700> self-expression

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
purposes the purpose of self-expression

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.930 
purposes the purpose of self-expression
in<00:07:30.930> the<00:07:30.990> creation<00:07:31.290> of<00:07:31.500> beauty<00:07:31.860> and<00:07:32.070> the

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
in the creation of beauty and the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.450 
in the creation of beauty and the
contemplation<00:07:33.570> of<00:07:33.780> order<00:07:34.230> these<00:07:34.860> kinds<00:07:35.400> of

contemplation of order these kinds of
phenomena<00:07:36.150> at<00:07:36.390> least<00:07:37.350> exist<00:07:38.130> in<00:07:38.310> humanity<00:07:38.880> now

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
phenomena at least exist in humanity now

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.700 
phenomena at least exist in humanity now
do<00:07:39.240> they<00:07:39.480> exist<00:07:39.750> in<00:07:39.990> other<00:07:40.230> parts<00:07:40.530> of<00:07:40.650> the

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710 
do they exist in other parts of the

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.590 
do they exist in other parts of the
world<00:07:40.800> I<00:07:41.130> don't<00:07:41.370> know<00:07:41.460> I<00:07:41.670> think<00:07:41.790> they<00:07:42.090> may<00:07:42.270> they

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 
may be you know could other creatures

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.230 
may be you know could other creatures
have<00:07:45.720> some<00:07:46.080> sort<00:07:46.260> of<00:07:46.320> aesthetic<00:07:47.240> capacities

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
have some sort of aesthetic capacities

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.630 
have some sort of aesthetic capacities
whether<00:07:49.140> they<00:07:49.350> do<00:07:49.410> or<00:07:49.560> they<00:07:49.710> don't<00:07:49.950> I<00:07:50.190> know<00:07:50.340> at

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.640 
whether they do or they don't I know at

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.880 
whether they do or they don't I know at
least<00:07:50.670> that<00:07:51.000> it<00:07:51.180> exists<00:07:51.510> in<00:07:51.600> humans<00:07:52.050> and<00:07:52.290> I

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.890 
least that it exists in humans and I

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.280 
least that it exists in humans and I
think<00:07:53.130> humans<00:07:53.520> are<00:07:53.700> a<00:07:53.760> part<00:07:53.880> of<00:07:54.210> nature<00:07:54.290> so

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.290 
think humans are a part of nature so

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.280 
think humans are a part of nature so
nature<00:07:55.710> itself<00:07:56.570> seems<00:07:57.570> to<00:07:57.960> have<00:07:58.110> made

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.290 
nature itself seems to have made

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.390 
nature itself seems to have made
possible<00:07:59.360> something<00:08:00.360> like<00:08:01.280> kinds<00:08:02.280> of

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 
possible something like kinds of

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.810 
possible something like kinds of
purposes<00:08:02.730> that<00:08:03.690> are<00:08:03.720> more<00:08:04.200> than<00:08:04.740> the<00:08:05.280> purpose

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:05.820 
purposes that are more than the purpose

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.750 
purposes that are more than the purpose
of<00:08:06.000> survival
