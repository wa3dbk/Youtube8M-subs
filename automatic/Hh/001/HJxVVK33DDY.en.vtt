00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.990 
new years one thing I've noticed with
this<00:00:22.170> surgery<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:25.010> afterwards<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.550> drink

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
this surgery is afterwards if you drink

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.019 
this surgery is afterwards if you drink
even<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.769> alcohol

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
even just a little bit of alcohol

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.000 
even just a little bit of alcohol
especially<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.349> say<00:00:32.329> vodka<00:00:34.010> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
especially like on all will say vodka it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
especially like on all will say vodka it
kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> affects<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.180> differently<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:37.440> least

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
kind of affects you differently at least

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.650 
kind of affects you differently at least
for<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.340> remember<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.829> pre-op

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
for me I remember when I was pre-op

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
for me I remember when I was pre-op
which<00:00:42.660> means<00:00:42.899> before<00:00:43.200> surgery<00:00:43.940> don't<00:00:44.940> ask<00:00:45.090> me

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
which means before surgery don't ask me

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
which means before surgery don't ask me
why<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> had<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> explain<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.079> anyway<00:00:46.789> before

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
why I had to explain that anyway before

why I had to explain that anyway before
I<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.149> pre-op<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.940> take<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I was pre-op it would take a lot of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.760 
I was pre-op it would take a lot of
alcohol<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:53.820> even<00:00:54.059> give<00:00:54.210> me<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> buzz<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
alcohol to even give me a buzz now it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
alcohol to even give me a buzz now it
