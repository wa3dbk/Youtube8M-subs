00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.570
 buy if I had no idea then total 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.520
 that I decided to record it with the webcam 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.150
 that the truth is that it looks pretty good 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.649
 Well it's very easy what we are going to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.559
 need is the mobile obviously and 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.420
 connect it by usb ok we got off the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.920
 file that in the application that has 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.800
 left the description box makes it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 to repeat and as you can see it is under 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 right away and it's a point file apk voucher 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.920
 Well now we connect it 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.300
 we connect 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.300
 let's open the folder 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.329
 where we have the application to see 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.830
 let's see if I can put it here 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.640
 obviously when stipulated dsb you go to 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.640
 have to give permission 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.570
 I'm working to see 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.570
 we are going to make permission here we have it 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.829
 we activate storage by usb 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.829
 our android mobile 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.760
 OK 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.110
 we wait a little and he will offer us in the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.110
 computer 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.660
 like it's connected 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.550
 Well, what I have done is create 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.990
 a folder here is called apec here is 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.850
 where I played all applications 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.370
 I download what is internet 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.740
 that is to say we enter in saying the folder of 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.870
 zyncro that is simply called what 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.640
 is the root voucher of the card or 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 as it connects that, everything appears 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.910
 this not all the pots and all the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 mushrooms that you can create before the mobile 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.520
 exam apk 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.520
 and there we put the application 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.270
 As you can see, I already have it inside 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.430
 what did not drag it inside you see 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.300
 here I have it together with other high rank 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300
 for tve-1 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.810
 and good now just to look for it in 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.780
 the mobile disconnected the usb the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.340
 we look for in the mobile that are not your 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.020
 mobile but I imagine it will be very 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.150
 I'm going to show it like mine 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.569
 you see 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.060
 what we have to do is 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.930
 we deactivated this and left this menu 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.930
 of usb 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.050
 we go to applications here to the menu 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.050
 we go here 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.510
 to the file manager and obviously like 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.510
 half the root because it has to be here 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.780
 recent will arrive recent 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.620
 in recent we appear in the case that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
 we do not have it like that and it does not appear 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.170
 recent its put to the one of this 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.360
 we can look for it in another way 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.360
 how are we going to get out 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.740
 it would simply be to give him a card and it is that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.910
 that is up and we go to the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.540
 folder that we created that was called 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.540
 to pica 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.660
 we use do not forget to press like to this 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.130
 video by the way very important 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.130
 and click on the application 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.970
 well this is worth it is not anything else 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.940
 we would simply already have what 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.650
 Is the game 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.230
 another thing is that I'm going to upload a video 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.420
 explaining all attack menus 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.950
 etcetera etcetera because you see that 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.020
 is in Japanese so I went through 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.250
 something difficult to play is normal but do not 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.160
 despair that I will upload a video 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.790
 explaining all the menus and all the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.990
 attacks etc etc. everything translated 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.390
 so subscribe to the channel if you're still 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.390
 and jota like button like 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.800
 dispatched
