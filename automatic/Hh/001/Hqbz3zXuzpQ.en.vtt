00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
increase and the blood pressure

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
increase and the blood pressure
increases<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.829> further<00:01:32.070> put

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
increases and this will further put

because this can also adversely affect
your<00:02:05.810> kidney<00:02:06.140> function

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
your kidney function

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.219 
your kidney function
in<00:02:07.430> addition<00:02:07.850> smoking<00:02:08.420> has<00:02:08.660> been<00:02:08.869> known<00:02:09.080> to

independent effects on the kidney

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.600 
independent effects on the kidney
function<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.450> best<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.840> avoid<00:02:14.960> tobacco

the<00:02:16.610> most<00:02:16.850> important<00:02:17.450> aspect<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.050> protecting

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the most important aspect of protecting

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.050 
the most important aspect of protecting
your<00:02:18.680> kidneys<00:02:19.010> which<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.430> think<00:02:19.730> would<00:02:20.000> be

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
your kidneys which I think would be

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.900 
your kidneys which I think would be
screening<00:02:20.780> meaning<00:02:21.740> as<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.610> talked<00:02:22.820> about

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
screening meaning as we talked about

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.330 
screening meaning as we talked about
earlier<00:02:23.240> kidney<00:02:23.870> disease<00:02:24.230> are<00:02:24.470> fairly

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
earlier kidney disease are fairly

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.970 
earlier kidney disease are fairly
asymptomatic<00:02:26.150> until<00:02:26.960> it<00:02:27.380> reaches<00:02:27.800> very

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
asymptomatic until it reaches very

asymptomatic until it reaches very
advanced<00:02:28.370> stage<00:02:28.700> when<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.030> begin<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.480> notice

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
advanced stage when you begin to notice

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
advanced stage when you begin to notice
symptoms<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> most<00:02:30.830> important<00:02:31.370> thing<00:02:31.550> is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
symptoms so the most important thing is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.820 
symptoms so the most important thing is
to<00:02:31.760> screen<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.750> detect<00:02:33.110> these<00:02:33.260> conditions

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
to screen and to detect these conditions

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.220 
to screen and to detect these conditions
early<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.090> corrective<00:02:35.660> measures<00:02:35.990> can<00:02:36.200> be

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
early so that corrective measures can be

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.490 
early so that corrective measures can be
taken<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.550> who<00:02:37.760> should<00:02:37.820> be<00:02:38.090> screened

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
taken up so who should be screened

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
taken up so who should be screened

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
also some independent risk factors so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.510 
also some independent risk factors so
these<00:02:57.440> patients<00:02:57.680> need<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.220> screened

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
these patients need to be screened

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.370 
these patients need to be screened
screening<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> very<00:02:59.630> simple<00:03:00.050> technique

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
screening is a very simple technique

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.710 
screening is a very simple technique
where<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:00.830> we<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.580> check<00:03:02.210> the<00:03:02.270> urine

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
where what we do is we check the urine

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.690 
where what we do is we check the urine
of<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.140> patient<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:04.220> whether<00:03:04.430> there<00:03:04.670> is

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
of the patient and see whether there is

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.170 
of the patient and see whether there is
any<00:03:04.970> leakage<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.870> protein<00:03:06.320> or<00:03:06.530> blood

routine<00:03:14.360> test<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.500> also<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.950> very<00:03:16.160> important

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
routine test is also a very important

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.030 
routine test is also a very important
aspect<00:03:16.880> especially<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:18.230> patients<00:03:18.380> who<00:03:18.830> are

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
aspect especially for patients who are

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.770 
aspect especially for patients who are
known<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.550> be<00:03:19.670> high<00:03:19.880> blood<00:03:20.030> having<00:03:20.600> high<00:03:20.750> blood

pressure or diabetes that should be a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.960 
pressure or diabetes that should be a
routinely<00:03:23.030> tested<00:03:23.650> entity<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:24.860> do<00:03:25.730> blood

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
routinely tested entity and you do blood

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.110 
routinely tested entity and you do blood
tests<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.450> look<00:03:26.480> at<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:28.130> serum<00:03:28.520> creatinine

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
tests to look at your serum creatinine

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.790 
tests to look at your serum creatinine
which<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.510> measure<00:03:29.780> of<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.110> waste<00:03:30.320> product

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
which is a measure of the waste product

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.440 
which is a measure of the waste product
that<00:03:30.950> your<00:03:31.100> kidney<00:03:31.400> excretes<00:03:31.880> out<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.270> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
that your kidney excretes out of the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.600 
that your kidney excretes out of the
body<00:03:32.630> if<00:03:33.560> your<00:03:33.739> creatinine<00:03:34.190> levels<00:03:34.489> are

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
body if your creatinine levels are

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.940 
body if your creatinine levels are
rising<00:03:34.760> then<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.360> means<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.870> your<00:03:36.170> kidneys

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
rising then it means that your kidneys

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.740 
rising then it means that your kidneys
are<00:03:37.100> not<00:03:37.130> functioning<00:03:37.250> appropriately<00:03:37.750> so

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
are not functioning appropriately so

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.570 
are not functioning appropriately so

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
doing a blood test in a urine test is a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.070 
doing a blood test in a urine test is a
simple<00:03:40.790> screening<00:03:41.239> technique<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.959> in

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
simple screening technique and in

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.250 
simple screening technique and in
addition<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:43.480> healthy<00:03:44.480> practices<00:03:45.019> like

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
addition you healthy practices like

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.440 
addition you healthy practices like
getting<00:03:45.890> an<00:03:46.010> annual<00:03:46.340> physical<00:03:46.760> examination

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
getting an annual physical examination
