00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm going to be looking at the posterior

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.340 
I'm going to be looking at the posterior
compartment<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.430> arm<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:42.360> specifically

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
compartment of the arm more specifically

compartment of the arm more specifically
first<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> talk<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.640> muscle

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
first I'm going to talk about the muscle

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880 
first I'm going to talk about the muscle
that<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.600> find<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> posterior

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that you find in that posterior

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
that you find in that posterior
compartment<00:00:47.120> then<00:00:48.120> I'm<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> talk<00:00:48.629> about

compartment then I'm going to talk about

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.400 
compartment then I'm going to talk about
the<00:00:49.050> innervation<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.610> muscle<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
the innervation for that muscle and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.630 
the innervation for that muscle and
lastly<00:00:52.410> I'm<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> talk<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.100> the

this video you have a great

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 
this video you have a great
understanding<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.620> in

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
understanding of what is going on in

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
understanding of what is going on in
that<00:01:01.829> posterior<00:01:02.760> compartment<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.690> let's<00:01:03.989> get

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that posterior compartment so let's get

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
that posterior compartment so let's get
right<00:01:04.409> into<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
right into it so what I'm going to do is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.850 
right into it so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> turn<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.900> guy<00:01:07.110> around<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I'm going to turn this guy around and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.700 
I'm going to turn this guy around and
then<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> zoom<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.140> region

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
then we're going to zoom into the region

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
then we're going to zoom into the region
of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.310> arm<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.150> we're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:13.049> at

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of the arm and we're going to look at

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
of the arm and we're going to look at
the<00:01:13.350> muscle<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.979> find<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the muscle that you find in the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
the muscle that you find in the
posterior<00:01:15.780> compartment<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.729> pretty

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
posterior compartment and it's pretty

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.359 
posterior compartment and it's pretty
simple<00:01:18.509> there's<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.560> muscle<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
simple there's only one muscle that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
simple there's only one muscle that
muscle<00:01:20.820> has<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.299> parts<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.170> only

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
muscle has three parts but there's only

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
muscle has three parts but there's only
one<00:01:22.590> muscle<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> full<00:01:23.880> cereal

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
one muscle in that full cereal

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.469 
one muscle in that full cereal
compartment<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.920> called<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
compartment and that is called the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
compartment and that is called the
triceps<00:01:27.479> brachii<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> see

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
triceps brachii all of this that you see

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
triceps brachii all of this that you see
here<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.229> posterior<00:01:31.770> compartment

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
here and in the posterior compartment

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.410 
here and in the posterior compartment
that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.479> triceps<00:01:34.290> brachii<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that is your triceps brachii and of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
that is your triceps brachii and of
course<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> reason<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.560> call<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> triceps

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
course the reason we call it the triceps

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
course the reason we call it the triceps
brachii<00:01:39.979> triceps<00:01:40.979> refers<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> fact<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
brachii triceps refers to the fact that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.730 
brachii triceps refers to the fact that
we<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.360> three<00:01:42.840> head<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.640> long<00:01:45.180> head

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
we have three head we have a long head

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
we have three head we have a long head
that's<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.820> guy<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:49.079> we

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that's going to be this guy and then we

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.969 
that's going to be this guy and then we
have<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:50.210> lateral<00:01:51.210> head<00:01:51.689> which<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.619> one

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have a lateral head which is this one

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.539 
have a lateral head which is this one
and<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.990> medial<00:01:55.680> head<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> in

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and then we have a medial head and in in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.389 
and then we have a medial head and in in
order<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.570> need<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.869> hide<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
order to see that we need to hide the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
order to see that we need to hide the
other<00:01:59.729> two<00:02:00.390> head<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> remove

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
other two head so I'm going to remove

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.190 
other two head so I'm going to remove
some<00:02:01.649> layers<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

some layers here and there you go I can
see<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:06.049> medial<00:02:07.049> head<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> triceps

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
see that medial head of the triceps

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.530 
see that medial head of the triceps
brachii<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> only<00:02:11.310> muscle<00:02:11.670> triceps

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
brachii that is the only muscle triceps

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.640 
brachii that is the only muscle triceps
brachii<00:02:12.870> once

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
brachii once

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
brachii once
again<00:02:13.829> triceps<00:02:14.489> refers<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.120> fact<00:02:15.329> that<00:02:15.510> we

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
again triceps refers to the fact that we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.360 
again triceps refers to the fact that we
have<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.379> zoom<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.519> there<00:02:18.000> by<00:02:18.209> mistake<00:02:19.220> let<00:02:20.220> me

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
have a zoom out there by mistake let me

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.059 
have a zoom out there by mistake let me
get<00:02:20.700> back<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:23.540> there<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.409> triceps

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
get back in there we go so the triceps

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
get back in there we go so the triceps
refers<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.730> fact<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.329> we<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.750> three

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
refers to the fact that we have three

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.099 
refers to the fact that we have three
heads<00:02:28.590> brachii<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.939> course<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.750> refers<00:02:31.079> to

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
heads brachii of course that refers to

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.970 
heads brachii of course that refers to
the<00:02:31.319> break<00:02:31.530> iam<00:02:31.829> Latin<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.700> arm<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.829> is

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
the break iam Latin for arm and that is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
the break iam Latin for arm and that is
the<00:02:35.129> muscle<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.569> posterior

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the muscle that we have in the posterior

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.349 
the muscle that we have in the posterior
compartment<00:02:37.760> innervation<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.879> that<00:02:39.090> muscle

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
compartment innervation of that muscle

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.660 
compartment innervation of that muscle
what<00:02:39.689> is<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> nerve<00:02:40.109> supply<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.950> muscle

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
what is the nerve supply to that muscle

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.319 
what is the nerve supply to that muscle
that<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.150> done<00:02:42.540> by<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.859> radial<00:02:43.859> nerve<00:02:44.640> the

about the function I like to show you
the<00:02:53.849> function<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.540> let's<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:55.139> right<00:02:55.170> here<00:02:55.440> into

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
the function so let's go right here into

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.000 
the function so let's go right here into
the<00:02:55.980> media<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the media so that you can see the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.000 
the media so that you can see the
extension<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.329> move<00:03:00.629> motion<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.530> here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
extension this move motion right here

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.539 
extension this move motion right here
that's<00:03:02.250> extension<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:04.470> elbow<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
that's extension of the elbow and you

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.210 
that's extension of the elbow and you
can<00:03:05.700> see<00:03:05.849> it<00:03:05.939> again<00:03:06.180> right<00:03:06.389> now<00:03:06.980> when<00:03:07.980> that

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
can see it again right now when that

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.160 
can see it again right now when that
contracts<00:03:08.909> generally<00:03:09.540> speaking<00:03:09.840> when<00:03:10.139> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
contracts generally speaking when a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.369 
contracts generally speaking when a
muscle<00:03:10.620> contracts<00:03:11.159> is<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.359> bit<00:03:12.750> it's

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
muscle contracts is going to bit it's

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.800 
muscle contracts is going to bit it's
going<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> pull<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.549> bone<00:03:14.909> that's<00:03:15.299> at<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
going to pull the the bone that's at the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.869 
going to pull the the bone that's at the
insertion<00:03:16.739> point<00:03:16.769> or<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> bone<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.699> it's

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
insertion point or the bone that it's

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.589 
insertion point or the bone that it's
inserting<00:03:18.449> in<00:03:18.629> on<00:03:19.079> sorry<00:03:19.980> towards<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.389> bone

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
inserting in on sorry towards the bone

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.500 
inserting in on sorry towards the bone
that<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.049> originating<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.669> this<00:03:24.150> case

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that it's originating and in this case

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.759 
that it's originating and in this case
we're<00:03:25.169> going<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.470> end<00:03:25.620> up<00:03:25.739> with<00:03:26.209> extension<00:03:27.209> of

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
we're going to end up with extension of

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.949 
we're going to end up with extension of
the<00:03:28.769> elbow

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the elbow

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.550 
the elbow
so<00:03:31.349> in<00:03:31.739> review<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:33.540> muscle<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.139> find<00:03:34.409> in

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
so in review the muscle that we find in

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.729 
so in review the muscle that we find in
the<00:03:34.650> posterior<00:03:35.040> compartment<00:03:35.310> would<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
the posterior compartment would be the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.309 
the posterior compartment would be the
triceps<00:03:37.739> brachii<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:39.030> innervation<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:40.109> that

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
triceps brachii the innervation of that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.610 
triceps brachii the innervation of that
muscle<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.090> radial<00:03:42.090> nerve<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
muscle is the radial nerve and the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.710 
muscle is the radial nerve and the
function<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:45.419> muscle<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:46.639> extension<00:03:47.639> of

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
function of that muscle is extension of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.259 
function of that muscle is extension of
the<00:03:48.720> elbow<00:03:49.019> so<00:03:49.859> extension<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.549> elbow<00:03:51.120> or

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
the elbow so extension at the elbow or

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.559 
the elbow so extension at the elbow or
you<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.690> call<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.049> extension<00:03:52.889> of<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.909> forearm

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
you can call it extension of the forearm

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.629 
you can call it extension of the forearm
so<00:03:55.229> that's<00:03:55.530> pretty<00:03:55.799> much<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.190> for<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.459> video
