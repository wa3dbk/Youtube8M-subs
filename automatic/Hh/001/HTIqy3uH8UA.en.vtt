00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.330 
uploading many to small episodes you
guys<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.260> been<00:00:16.440> bombarding<00:00:17.190> me<00:00:17.310> with

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
guys have been bombarding me with

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
guys have been bombarding me with
requests<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.150> another<00:00:18.390> video<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
requests to do another video and you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
requests to do another video and you
know<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.890> fantastic<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.910> shows<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
know what that is fantastic it shows to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.359 
know what that is fantastic it shows to
me<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.050> enjoy<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> videos<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.949> I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
me that you enjoy the videos and I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.189 
me that you enjoy the videos and I
personally<00:00:23.880> really<00:00:24.210> enjoy<00:00:24.570> recording<00:00:24.900> them

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
personally really enjoy recording them

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
personally really enjoy recording them
so<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.070> win-win<00:00:26.279> however<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so it's a bit of a win-win however I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
so it's a bit of a win-win however I
have<00:00:27.750> been<00:00:27.779> lacking<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> idea<00:00:29.039> side<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
have been lacking in the idea side of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.740 
have been lacking in the idea side of
things<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.939> wouldn't<00:00:30.210> mind<00:00:30.300> heading

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
things so if you wouldn't mind heading

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.450 
things so if you wouldn't mind heading
down<00:00:30.929> into<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> comments<00:00:31.650> section<00:00:32.009> below

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
down into the comments section below

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.950 
down into the comments section below
and<00:00:32.550> putting<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> request<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> next

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
and putting in a request for the next

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660 
and putting in a request for the next
episode<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.399> more<00:00:35.610> than

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
episode that would be more than

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670 
episode that would be more than
appreciated<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.660> anyway<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.200> today's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
appreciated but anyway in today's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
appreciated but anyway in today's
episode<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.820> taking<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> look

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
episode we are going to be taking a look

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.610 
episode we are going to be taking a look
at<00:00:39.300> something<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.809> quite<00:00:40.020> awesome<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
at something really quite awesome and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.979 
at something really quite awesome and
that<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> automatic<00:00:41.700> ice<00:00:42.059> farm<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that is the automatic ice farm what it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.779 
that is the automatic ice farm what it
does<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> ice<00:00:43.980> comes<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.730> will

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
does is when the ice comes in it will

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
does is when the ice comes in it will
push<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.300> across<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.050> into<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.410> giant<00:00:46.800> minor

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
push it up across and into a giant minor

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
push it up across and into a giant minor
ball<00:00:47.370> cube<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.390> walk<00:00:48.539> along

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
ball cube so you can just walk along

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
ball cube so you can just walk along
with<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:48.989> silk<00:00:49.200> touch<00:00:49.350> pick<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> walk<00:00:50.250> away

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
with your silk touch pick and walk away

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
with your silk touch pick and walk away
a<00:00:50.550> happy<00:00:50.910> man<00:00:51.350> now<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> Redstone<00:00:52.920> behind<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a happy man now the Redstone behind this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
a happy man now the Redstone behind this
one<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> quite<00:00:54.510> simple<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
one really is quite simple all of the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
one really is quite simple all of the
mechanics<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.579> easy<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> understand

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
mechanics are very easy to understand

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
mechanics are very easy to understand
however<00:00:57.780> most<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> wiring<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> actually

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
however most of the wiring is actually

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
however most of the wiring is actually
in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> timing<00:01:00.480> circuits<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in the timing circuits so the way that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
in the timing circuits so the way that
we<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> work<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
we got this to work is we have got a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.600 
we got this to work is we have got a
layer<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.989> water<00:01:04.199> source<00:01:04.559> blocks<00:01:04.739> due<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
layer of water source blocks due to the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.890 
layer of water source blocks due to the
fact<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> snowy<00:01:06.479> biome

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
fact that we're in a snowy biome

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
fact that we're in a snowy biome
occasionally<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.920> turn<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.310> ice<00:01:08.610> now

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
occasionally they will turn into ice now

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
occasionally they will turn into ice now
underneath<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.960> ice<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> water

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
underneath this ice and water

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
underneath this ice and water
combination<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> layer<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
combination we have got a layer of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
combination we have got a layer of
Pistons<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.439> every<00:01:13.619> couple<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.950> minutes<00:01:14.070> or

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
Pistons and every couple of minutes or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
Pistons and every couple of minutes or
so<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.150> post<00:01:15.360> upwards<00:01:15.930> pushing<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so they will post upwards pushing of the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.219 
so they will post upwards pushing of the
ice<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.640> piston<00:01:18.240> feed<00:01:18.479> tape<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> then

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
ice into a piston feed tape and then

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.630 
ice into a piston feed tape and then
what<00:01:19.380> happens<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.830> gets<00:01:20.100> pushed<00:01:20.310> across

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
what happens is it gets pushed across

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.390 
what happens is it gets pushed across
and<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> put<00:01:21.930> into<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.470> big<00:01:22.740> cube<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and down and put into that big cube so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
and down and put into that big cube so
that<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.820> walk<00:01:23.970> along<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.299> mine<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.689> now

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that you can walk along and mine it now

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
that you can walk along and mine it now
the<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.439> complication<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.460> here

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the only complication that we have here

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
the only complication that we have here
is<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.479> need<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> water<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.500> stay<00:01:28.740> as

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is that we need the water to stay as

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
is that we need the water to stay as
water<00:01:29.310> source<00:01:29.640> blocks<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.600> involved

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
water source blocks and that involved

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.109 
water source blocks and that involved
some<00:01:31.170> tricks<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.680> dispensers<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.520> double

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
some tricks with dispensers and double

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.499 
some tricks with dispensers and double
pulses<00:01:33.540> they'll<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.229> onto<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.100> bit

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
pulses they'll get onto in a little bit

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.940 
pulses they'll get onto in a little bit
so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> thought<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.140> might<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.470> well<00:01:37.590> give<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
so I thought I might as well give you a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
so I thought I might as well give you a
really<00:01:38.369> quick<00:01:38.490> run-through<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
really quick run-through of all of the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
really quick run-through of all of the
elements<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> design<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.220> front<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
elements of this design so in front of

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.789 
elements of this design so in front of
you<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> timer<00:01:43.079> circuit<00:01:43.409> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you you can see the timer circuit I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
you you can see the timer circuit I'm
sure<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> all<00:01:44.340> recognize<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
sure you all recognize this one is a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
sure you all recognize this one is a
hopper<00:01:46.110> timer<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.100> fire<00:01:47.340> every<00:01:47.790> one

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
hopper timer and it will fire every one

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
hopper timer and it will fire every one
or<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.180> minutes<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.229> will<00:01:49.290> obviously

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
or two minutes and it will obviously

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
or two minutes and it will obviously
tell<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> Machine<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.659> down

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
tell the Machine when to go off now down

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810 
tell the Machine when to go off now down
at<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> bomb<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> Pistons

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
at the bomb we have all of the Pistons

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.789 
at the bomb we have all of the Pistons
they're<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> push<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:55.020> eyes<00:01:55.229> upwards

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
they're going to push your eyes upwards

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
they're going to push your eyes upwards
into<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.610> Pistons<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
into these Pistons now this is the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
into these Pistons now this is the
double<00:01:58.229> piston<00:01:58.500> extender<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.520> push

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
double piston extender which will push

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
double piston extender which will push
your<00:01:59.909> ice<00:02:00.090> across<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.079> will<00:02:01.200> travel<00:02:01.439> along

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
your ice across and it will travel along

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
your ice across and it will travel along
here<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.270> section<00:02:03.750> which

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
here and then into this section which

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
here and then into this section which
will<00:02:04.350> push<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.100> ice<00:02:05.280> downwards<00:02:05.909> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
will push all of the ice downwards so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.900 
will push all of the ice downwards so
that<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> put<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.619> big<00:02:07.979> square<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that it can be put into a big square and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
that it can be put into a big square and
you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.360> walk<00:02:09.539> along<00:02:09.690> mining<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.530> all

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you can just walk along mining it all

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
you can just walk along mining it all
now<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> minute<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.060> quite

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
now at the minute because it's not quite

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.760 
now at the minute because it's not quite
done<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> bit<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.379> an<00:02:13.530> ore

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
done it's in a bit of an ore

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
done it's in a bit of an ore
shape<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.460> once<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.820> fills<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.270> obviously<00:02:15.930> all

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
shape but once it fills up obviously all

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.550 
shape but once it fills up obviously all
look<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.320> geometric<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:18.140> finally<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
look very geometric and finally on to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
look very geometric and finally on to
one<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.860> most<00:02:19.950> important<00:02:20.580> parts<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
one of the most important parts of the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.720 
one of the most important parts of the
design<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> water<00:02:22.920> system<00:02:23.520> what

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
design and that is the water system what

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
design and that is the water system what
we<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.420> create<00:02:24.960> infinite<00:02:25.560> water

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
we have to do is create infinite water

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.220 
we have to do is create infinite water
sources<00:02:26.460> along<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.690> needs<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.990> fill

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
sources along here so it needs to fill

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.170 
sources along here so it needs to fill
up<00:02:28.380> create<00:02:28.920> an<00:02:29.070> infinite<00:02:29.400> water<00:02:29.640> source<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
up create an infinite water source and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.990 
up create an infinite water source and
then<00:02:30.810> retract<00:02:31.350> all<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> water<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.460> so

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
then retract all of the water back in so

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.360 
then retract all of the water back in so
that<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.750> full<00:02:34.140> water<00:02:34.470> bucket<00:02:34.920> inside

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
that we have a full water bucket inside

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.730 
that we have a full water bucket inside
these<00:02:35.580> dispensers<00:02:36.240> ready<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> go<00:02:37.410> off

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
these dispensers ready for it to go off

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.590 
these dispensers ready for it to go off
if<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.100> didn't<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.300> farm

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
if we didn't have that then this farm

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
if we didn't have that then this farm
would<00:02:39.750> not<00:02:39.960> be<00:02:40.080> able<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.530> reset<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.490> does

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
would not be able to reset like it does

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.790 
would not be able to reset like it does
and<00:02:41.850> we'd<00:02:42.240> lose<00:02:42.390> all<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> water<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
and we'd lose all of the water and it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.680 
and we'd lose all of the water and it
would<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.310> fully<00:02:44.580> automatic<00:02:45.300> now<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.570> you

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
would not be fully automatic now if you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.000 
would not be fully automatic now if you
do<00:02:45.810> want<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:45.990> take<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> closer<00:02:46.500> look<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.830> all<00:02:46.980> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
do want to take a closer look at all of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070 
do want to take a closer look at all of
these<00:02:47.310> mechanisms<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.750> check<00:02:48.960> how

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
these mechanisms then you can check how

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840 
these mechanisms then you can check how
the<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:49.380> download<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.130> obviously<00:02:50.340> I'm

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
the well download because obviously I'm

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.760 
the well download because obviously I'm
not<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.660> be<00:02:51.720> doing<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.990> tutorial<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.560> this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
not going to be doing a tutorial on this
