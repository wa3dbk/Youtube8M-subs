drop a coordinate on that brush pile and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.180 
drop a coordinate on that brush pile and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
seek to have that location bar and so

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.039 
seek to have that location bar and so
you<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.549> see<00:01:21.729> relative<00:01:22.210> where<00:01:22.390> your<00:01:22.540> boats<00:01:22.780> at

to the structure to these drop offs and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.300 
to the structure to these drop offs and
the<00:01:25.690> best<00:01:25.900> thing<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.290> because<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.070> know<00:01:27.159> when

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
the best thing is because you know when

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.950 
the best thing is because you know when
I<00:01:27.340> saw<00:01:27.580> side<00:01:27.880> imaging<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.390> couple<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.719> years<00:01:28.750> ago

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
I saw side imaging a couple of years ago

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.630 
I saw side imaging a couple of years ago
I<00:01:29.140> knew<00:01:29.439> it<00:01:29.619> would<00:01:29.829> change<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.280> way<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.520> I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
I knew it would change the way that I

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.300 
I knew it would change the way that I
fish<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.390> has<00:01:31.600> i<00:01:31.930> mean<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.979> seeing

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
fish and it has i mean we're seeing

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.950 
fish and it has i mean we're seeing
things<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:33.789> we're<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.060> much<00:01:34.240> more<00:01:34.270> efficient

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
things and we're so much more efficient

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.990 
things and we're so much more efficient
