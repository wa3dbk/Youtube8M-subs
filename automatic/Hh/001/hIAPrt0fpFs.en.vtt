players feed on 2 inch and it's it's a
curiosity<00:00:56.630> about<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.140> optimizing<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.800> size

curiosity about of optimizing the size
we<00:00:58.010> have<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:58.489> window<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.149> display<00:00:59.780> glued

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
we have this window and display glued

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.720 
we have this window and display glued
together<00:01:00.200> so<00:01:00.590> they<00:01:00.680> actually<00:01:00.950> interconnected

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
together so they actually interconnected

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.049 
together so they actually interconnected
and<00:01:02.739> eliminating<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> depth<00:01:04.399> and<00:01:04.610> kind<00:01:05.030> of

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
and eliminating the depth and kind of

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.429 
and eliminating the depth and kind of
the<00:01:05.180> gap<00:01:05.329> between<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.840> window<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
the gap between the window and the

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.099 
the gap between the window and the
displacer<00:01:07.009> so<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:07.249> have<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:07.490> very<00:01:08.109> visual

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
displacer so you have this very visual

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.199 
displacer so you have this very visual
feature<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.859> very<00:01:10.039> kind<00:01:10.249> of<00:01:10.340> out<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.090> out

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.209 
feature and very kind of out and out

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.300 
feature and very kind of out and out
burn<00:01:11.509> victim<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.499> avoid<00:01:12.709> this

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
burn victim and avoid this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.330 
burn victim and avoid this
then<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> NFC<00:01:15.780> enable<00:01:16.770> text<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
then we have the NFC enable text so the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
then we have the NFC enable text so the
NFC<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.759> located<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.329> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.659> mass<00:01:19.079> so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
NFC is located here at the back mass so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
NFC is located here at the back mass so
let's<00:01:19.979> demonstrate<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.579> popular<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> can

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 

when<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.780> dedicated<00:02:15.780> camera<00:02:16.050> key<00:02:16.379> on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
when we have the dedicated camera key on

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
when we have the dedicated camera key on
the<00:02:16.650> side<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.129> how<00:02:18.090> many<00:02:18.239> megapixels<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the side here how many megapixels is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.280 
the side here how many megapixels is
this<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.560> 5<00:02:19.769> megapixel<00:02:20.489> camera<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.290> it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this one it's 5 megapixel camera and it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.940 
this one it's 5 megapixel camera and it
actually<00:02:22.530> takes<00:02:22.890> also<00:02:23.099> HD<00:02:23.580> video<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:25.860> to

actually takes also HD video we want to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970 
actually takes also HD video we want to
do<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> video

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830 

I've<00:02:30.489> been<00:02:30.670> here

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I've been here

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.930 
I've been here
that's<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> one<00:02:32.709> gigahertz<00:02:33.010> processor<00:02:33.250> so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
that's the one gigahertz processor so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.119 
that's the one gigahertz processor so
for<00:02:34.150> optimal<00:02:34.720> speed<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.260> important<00:02:35.739> together

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
for optimal speed and important together

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.030 
for optimal speed and important together
with<00:02:36.310> an<00:02:36.459> UI<00:02:36.640> yaxha<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.300> get<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> better<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
with an UI yaxha to get a better and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.570 
with an UI yaxha to get a better and
more<00:02:39.069> smooth<00:02:39.580> feeling<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:41.580> probably

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
more smooth feeling for the probably

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.160 
more smooth feeling for the probably
seen<00:02:42.730> these<00:02:42.879> transitions<00:02:43.480> from<00:02:43.599> place<00:02:43.989> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
seen these transitions from place to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
seen these transitions from place to
place<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.680> also<00:02:45.250> with<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> value<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:45.970> have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
place and also with the value I have

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.170 
place and also with the value I have
certainly<00:02:46.840> possibilities<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.849> move<00:02:48.849> on<00:02:49.030> to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
certainly possibilities to move on to

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.750 
certainly possibilities to move on to
these<00:02:49.299> widgets<00:02:50.019> come<00:02:50.379> taste<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.769> page<00:02:50.950> so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
these widgets come taste the page so

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.789 
these widgets come taste the page so
holding<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.480> linking<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.620> side

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
holding one and linking it to the side

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.500 
holding one and linking it to the side
here<00:02:54.040> waiting<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.489> move<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.060> next<00:02:55.269> page

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
here waiting then move to the next page

you can drop it for now I don't have any

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.860 
you can drop it for now I don't have any
space<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.700> won't<00:02:58.060> drop<00:02:58.239> into<00:02:58.540> any<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.750> those

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
space so it won't drop into any of those

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.650 
space so it won't drop into any of those
want<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.230> make<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.950> it<00:02:59.980> backward<00:03:00.430> one<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.540> can
