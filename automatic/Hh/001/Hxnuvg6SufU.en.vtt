00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.100 
it works really really well but yeah
that's<00:06:09.360> pretty<00:06:09.629> much<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:10.020> for<00:06:10.529> me

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that's pretty much it for me

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.920 
that's pretty much it for me
I<00:06:13.139> believe<00:06:13.979> aspirin<00:06:14.639> works<00:06:14.879> the<00:06:15.120> best<00:06:15.389> but

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
I believe aspirin works the best but

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.619 
I believe aspirin works the best but
that's<00:06:16.110> for<00:06:16.710> myself<00:06:17.219> like<00:06:17.940> I<00:06:18.089> said<00:06:18.300> tea<00:06:18.449> tree

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
that's for myself like I said tea tree

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.399 
that's for myself like I said tea tree
oil<00:06:18.810> works<00:06:19.050> great<00:06:20.039> for<00:06:20.069> people<00:06:20.810> it<00:06:21.810> worked

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
oil works great for people it worked

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:24.619 
oil works great for people it worked
more<00:06:22.620> more<00:06:23.099> so<00:06:23.250> for<00:06:23.430> this<00:06:23.610> woman<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:23.969> didn't<00:06:24.330> for

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
more more so for this woman I didn't for

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.829

my other one

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.019 
my other one
but<00:06:27.839> so<00:06:28.110> far<00:06:28.349> aspirin<00:06:29.009> is<00:06:29.279> the<00:06:29.430> one<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.819> has

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
but so far aspirin is the one that has

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.100 
but so far aspirin is the one that has
