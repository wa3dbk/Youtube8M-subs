00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you can use it for actually buying games

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.490 
you can use it for actually buying games
or<00:01:40.140> even<00:01:40.380> apps<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.460> things<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
open the devices slightly little bit so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
open the devices slightly little bit so
I<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.590> least<00:01:49.619> set<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> window<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.790> we

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I can at least set up the window so we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.260 
I can at least set up the window so we
can<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> unboxing<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.030> quick

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
can do the unboxing and be really quick

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.959 
can do the unboxing and be really quick
but<00:01:54.689> yeah<00:01:55.350> once<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> remove<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.549> paper

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
but yeah once you remove the paper

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.899 
but yeah once you remove the paper
slipcase<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.670> plain
