00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the most powerful scale okay now why is

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.060 
the most powerful scale okay now why is
this<00:02:48.500> powerful<00:02:48.830> here's<00:02:49.640> why<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.710> lot<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
this powerful here's why like a lot of

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.010 
this powerful here's why like a lot of
scales<00:02:52.340> well<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:52.910> all<00:02:53.060> scales<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
scales well like all scales on the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.020 
scales well like all scales on the
guitar<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.830> move<00:02:55.100> them<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.520> down<00:02:55.640> so

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
guitar you can move them up and down so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.320 
guitar you can move them up and down so
you<00:02:56.300> can<00:02:56.420> play<00:02:56.570> them<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.840> any<00:02:56.990> key<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:58.370> can

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
you can play them in any key you can

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.420 
you can play them in any key you can
play<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.960> major<00:03:00.170> or<00:03:00.410> minor<00:03:00.620> key<00:03:01.070> like

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
play this in a major or minor key like

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.220 
play this in a major or minor key like
most<00:03:01.640> scales<00:03:01.970> but<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.630> reason<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.020> so

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
most scales but the reason that it's so

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.960 
most scales but the reason that it's so
powerful<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.950> one<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.400> super<00:03:04.670> easy<00:03:04.700> to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
powerful is one it's super easy to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.330 
powerful is one it's super easy to
remember<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.810> can<00:03:05.959> use<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.440> over<00:03:06.709> just

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
remember and you can use it over just

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.430 
remember and you can use it over just
about<00:03:07.550> any<00:03:07.910> chord<00:03:08.510> progression<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.200> it's

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
about any chord progression and it's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.270 
about any chord progression and it's
going<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> work<00:03:09.890> very<00:03:10.220> safe<00:03:11.090> notes<00:03:11.480> okay<00:03:12.280> like

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
going to work very safe notes okay like

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.910 
going to work very safe notes okay like
for<00:03:13.790> instance<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.720> we<00:03:14.780> were<00:03:15.080> playing<00:03:15.260> an<00:03:15.620> a

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
for instance if we were playing an a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.140 
for instance if we were playing an a
minor<00:03:16.280> chord<00:03:16.400> progression

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680 

you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.510 

something<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.260> that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
something like that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:38.830 
something like that
this<00:03:27.060> scale<00:03:27.930> would<00:03:28.530> work<00:03:28.710> great

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.830 

it's<00:03:39.709> hard<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> play<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:41.180> chords<00:03:41.540> in<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
it's hard to play the chords in the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:04:01.080 
it's hard to play the chords in the
scale<00:03:42.230> same<00:03:42.860> time<00:03:43.160> but<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.790> get<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> idea

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.949 

it<00:04:02.090> sounds<00:04:02.390> real<00:04:02.540> nice<00:04:02.799> so<00:04:04.060> now<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.750> is<00:04:05.870> how

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
it sounds real nice so now this is how

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.380 
it sounds real nice so now this is how
you<00:04:06.019> remember<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:07.010> any<00:04:07.220> minor<00:04:07.670> song<00:04:08.120> that

have a chord progression that's in C

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.430 
have a chord progression that's in C
then<00:05:11.550> start<00:05:12.180> off<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:12.510> your<00:05:12.660> pinkie<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.290> you

can noodle around with that same exact
form<00:05:16.700> okay<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.000> key<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.240> C<00:05:18.420> you<00:05:18.810> have<00:05:18.900> a

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
form okay in the key of C you have a

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.690 
form okay in the key of C you have a
silence<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.440> key<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.710> minor<00:05:19.890> then<00:05:20.580> you

silence in the key of a minor then you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.660 
silence in the key of a minor then you
can<00:05:20.880> use<00:05:21.060> that<00:05:21.210> same<00:05:21.420> exact<00:05:21.780> form<00:05:22.170> but<00:05:22.680> now<00:05:23.610> the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
you're going to noodle around the most

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.820 
you're going to noodle around the most
okay<00:05:29.210> if<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.420> have<00:05:30.540> other<00:05:30.720> Keys<00:05:31.020> just<00:05:31.440> move<00:05:31.680> it

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
okay if you have other Keys just move it

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.520 
okay if you have other Keys just move it
up<00:05:31.980> or<00:05:32.310> down<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.910> fretboard<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:33.660> it's<00:05:33.930> say<00:05:34.470> you

up or down the fretboard so it's say you

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.390 
up or down the fretboard so it's say you
have<00:05:34.800> something<00:05:35.250> in<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.520> key<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.730> G<00:05:36.180> flat<00:05:36.380> then

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
have something in the key of G flat then

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.810 
have something in the key of G flat then
I'm<00:05:38.400> sorry

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
yeah let's say G flat minor there's a a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.340 
yeah let's say G flat minor there's a a
flat<00:05:42.720> G<00:05:42.990> G<00:05:43.860> flat<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:44.610> G<00:05:44.850> flat<00:05:45.060> minor<00:05:45.350> you're

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:50.619 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:55.359 

get<00:05:51.619> it<00:05:51.909> let's<00:05:52.909> say<00:05:53.149> it<00:05:53.449> was<00:05:53.779> in<00:05:54.110> well<00:05:54.949> if<00:05:55.189> it

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:55.369 
get it let's say it was in well if it

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.369 
get it let's say it was in well if it
were<00:05:55.550> in<00:05:55.729> a<00:05:55.969> major<00:05:56.300> well<00:05:56.719> then<00:05:56.839> RA<00:05:56.989> is<00:05:57.139> right

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
were in a major well then RA is right

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:05.259 
were in a major well then RA is right
there<00:06:01.839> same<00:06:02.839> exact<00:06:03.199> form<00:06:03.909> but<00:06:04.909> we're<00:06:05.029> starting

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:05.269 
there same exact form but we're starting

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:07.419 
there same exact form but we're starting
on<00:06:05.419> the<00:06:05.539> pinky<00:06:06.019> okay<00:06:06.619> I'm<00:06:06.800> it<00:06:06.979> and<00:06:07.129> then<00:06:07.219> that's

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:07.429 
on the pinky okay I'm it and then that's

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.999 
on the pinky okay I'm it and then that's
going<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.669> be<00:06:07.729> our<00:06:08.089> our<00:06:08.599> home<00:06:08.869> so<00:06:09.499> just<00:06:09.529> figure

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
going to be our our home so just figure

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.709 
going to be our our home so just figure
it<00:06:10.159> out<00:06:10.249> if<00:06:10.459> you<00:06:10.550> know<00:06:10.669> the<00:06:10.819> major<00:06:11.059> key<00:06:11.479> or

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
it out if you know the major key or

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.869 
it out if you know the major key or
minor<00:06:12.080> key<00:06:12.379> of<00:06:12.589> a<00:06:13.039> tune<00:06:13.279> well<00:06:13.489> first<00:06:13.669> you<00:06:13.789> got

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
minor key of a tune well first you got

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:15.729 
minor key of a tune well first you got
to<00:06:13.909> figure<00:06:13.999> out<00:06:14.330> if<00:06:14.779> it's<00:06:15.019> major<00:06:15.379> and<00:06:15.589> minor

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:15.739 
to figure out if it's major and minor

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:17.790 
to figure out if it's major and minor
then<00:06:16.009> figure<00:06:16.699> out<00:06:16.729> what<00:06:17.029> the<00:06:17.149> root<00:06:17.330> is<00:06:17.539> and

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
then figure out what the root is and

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.249 
then figure out what the root is and
then<00:06:18.800> you'll<00:06:19.189> be<00:06:19.249> able<00:06:19.459> to<00:06:19.639> use<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:21.050> most

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
then you'll be able to use the most

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:28.089 
then you'll be able to use the most
powerful<00:06:21.819> scale<00:06:22.819> in<00:06:23.209> the<00:06:23.300> world<00:06:25.119> okay<00:06:26.979> this<00:06:27.979> is
