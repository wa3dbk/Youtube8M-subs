00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
excetera so pretty simple I think once I

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.960 
excetera so pretty simple I think once I
do<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.980> couple<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.250> times<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:25.640> be<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.760> lot
