Man<00:00:10.530> helmet<00:00:12.110> first<00:00:13.110> thing<00:00:13.320> I've<00:00:13.440> got<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.860> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
Man helmet first thing I've got here is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.840 
Man helmet first thing I've got here is
an<00:00:14.190> inverter<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.920> used<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.160> convert<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
an inverter this is a used to convert a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.650 
an inverter this is a used to convert a
direct<00:00:18.420> current<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.260> battery<00:00:20.359> hooked<00:00:21.359> up

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
direct current from a battery hooked up

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.620 
direct current from a battery hooked up
to<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> inverter<00:00:22.880> it's<00:00:23.880> basically<00:00:24.539> just

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to the inverter it's basically just

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.390 
to the inverter it's basically just
converts<00:00:25.140> into<00:00:25.320> an<00:00:25.529> AC<00:00:25.650> current<00:00:26.010> which<00:00:26.369> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
converts into an AC current which is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.679 
converts into an AC current which is
required<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.240> any

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
required for any

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
required for any
e-l<00:00:30.019> devices<00:00:31.019> where<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.380> eel<00:00:31.560> wire<00:00:31.890> like

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
e-l devices where it's an eel wire like

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.910 
e-l devices where it's an eel wire like
this<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:32.910> well<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.899> an<00:00:34.020> L<00:00:34.230> seat<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this one here or well it's an L seat I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
this one here or well it's an L seat I
have<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.090> you'll<00:00:36.510> see<00:00:36.719> that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
have a little bit of my you'll see that

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
have a little bit of my you'll see that
I<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.380> eyes<00:00:37.680> left<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:39.270> prisoner

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I use for my eyes left over to prisoner

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
I use for my eyes left over to prisoner
you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> got<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.219> poles

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you can see it's got the two poles

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.810 
you can see it's got the two poles
around<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> edge<00:00:42.329> there<00:00:43.219> Bart<00:00:44.219> Lisa<00:00:44.340> show<00:00:44.760> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
around the edge there Bart Lisa show you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.100 
around the edge there Bart Lisa show you
the<00:00:45.950> inverter<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.719> bought<00:00:48.719> matching<00:00:48.899> up

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the inverter one so I bought matching up

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
the inverter one so I bought matching up
so<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.829> yellow<00:00:50.039> wires<00:00:50.309> going

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so you can see that yellow wires going

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
so you can see that yellow wires going
off<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.379> ones<00:00:52.559> especially<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.309> two

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
off the other ones especially got two

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
off the other ones especially got two
outputs<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.090> inverter<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.230> one's<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
outputs from this inverter it one's just

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
outputs from this inverter it one's just
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.890> crocodile<00:00:56.309> clips<00:00:56.809> now<00:00:57.809> had<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
going to these crocodile clips now had a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
going to these crocodile clips now had a
bit<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> problems<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:59.370> getting<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
bit of problems with getting the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.689 
bit of problems with getting the
connection<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.020> yi<00:01:01.260> l<00:01:01.379> sheet<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
connection to yi l sheet because you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.179 
connection to yi l sheet because you
can't<00:01:03.000> solder<00:01:03.870> directly<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:04.890> points

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can't solder directly to these points

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
can't solder directly to these points
because<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.820> he<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.119> melts<00:01:06.510> through<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
because a bit he just melts through so I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
because a bit he just melts through so I
did<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.909> staples

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
did was I use staples

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
did was I use staples
I<00:01:09.750> basically<00:01:10.320> stapled<00:01:10.860> through<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> two

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I basically stapled through the two

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
I basically stapled through the two
poles<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> glue<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> hold<00:01:13.650> them

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
poles and put a bit of glue to hold them

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.550 
poles and put a bit of glue to hold them
steady<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:15.420> sold<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> onto<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> staples

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
steady and then sold it onto the staples

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.910 
steady and then sold it onto the staples
and<00:01:17.479> what's<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.619> I'll<00:01:19.740> show<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and what's very well and I'll show you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
and what's very well and I'll show you
the<00:01:19.979> inside<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> Mohammed<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> second<00:01:21.420> box

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the inside of Mohammed in the second box

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
the inside of Mohammed in the second box
like<00:01:22.040> this<00:01:23.040> Scott<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> secon

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
like this Scott up so I just a secon

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
like this Scott up so I just a secon
coming<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> inverter<00:01:27.090> doesn't

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
coming out of the inverter doesn't

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
coming out of the inverter doesn't
matter<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:28.049> around<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> these

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
matter which way around you get these

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.480 
matter which way around you get these
two<00:01:29.220> poles<00:01:29.670> set<00:01:30.030> up<00:01:30.680> but

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
two poles set up but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.510 
two poles set up but
he's<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.070> connected<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
he's not it's not connected to the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.770 
he's not it's not connected to the
battery<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.000> moment<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.540> gotta<00:01:36.690> be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
battery at the moment you gotta be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
battery at the moment you gotta be
careful<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.250> AC<00:01:38.400> can't<00:01:38.820> give

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
careful that because the AC can't give

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.540 
careful that because the AC can't give
you<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> nasty<00:01:39.330> shock<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.290> I've<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.310> quite<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
you a nasty shock and I've had quite a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.590 
you a nasty shock and I've had quite a
few<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.780> getting<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> letter<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.600> is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
few if I was getting this letter and is

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.980 
few if I was getting this letter and is
like<00:01:45.750> okay<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.619> I'll<00:01:47.070> connect<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.430> battery

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.670 

and<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:52.440> fights<00:01:53.440> coming<00:01:53.770> from<00:01:53.890> there<00:01:54.040> off<00:01:54.280> on

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and see fights coming from there off on

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.290 
and see fights coming from there off on
on<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> basically<00:01:58.479> what<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.050> did<00:01:59.110> for<00:01:59.320> mine<00:02:00.300> was

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
on so basically what I did for mine was

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.380 
on so basically what I did for mine was
I<00:02:01.860> encompass<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:02.979> in<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.100> box<00:02:03.310> put<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:04.000> switch

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
I encompass it in a box put a switch

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990 
I encompass it in a box put a switch
online<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.799> switch<00:02:06.009> basically<00:02:06.430> runs<00:02:06.670> between

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
online the switch basically runs between

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.710

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the thought of electrical tape held in

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.060 
the thought of electrical tape held in
the<00:04:18.090> back<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.419> those<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:19.530> make<00:04:19.650> sure<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:19.949> well

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the back of those to make sure it's well

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770 
the back of those to make sure it's well
insulators<00:04:20.609> haven't<00:04:21.030> shot<00:04:21.239> myself<00:04:21.419> in<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
insulators haven't shot myself in the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.070 
insulators haven't shot myself in the
face<00:04:22.049> when<00:04:22.350> putting<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:22.710> off<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:27.080> taking

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
face when putting on off and just taking

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.050 
face when putting on off and just taking
off<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.470> it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
off of it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.720 
off of it
there<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.650> wire<00:04:31.650> holding<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.220> place<00:04:32.250> there

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
there is a wire holding in place there

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.520 
there is a wire holding in place there
with<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.510> little<00:04:33.780> connection<00:04:34.140> so<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.410> still

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
with a little connection so I can still

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.380 
with a little connection so I can still
take<00:04:34.680> off<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.040> there<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.700> enough<00:04:35.880> flex<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.300> it

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
take off and there is enough flex in it

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.790 
take off and there is enough flex in it
so<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.960> get<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.200> do<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.320> go<00:04:37.680> ahead

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
so that what I get to do here go ahead

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.950 
so that what I get to do here go ahead
and<00:04:38.010> put<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.850> will<00:04:39.000> go<00:04:39.120> up<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.300> down<00:04:39.480> and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and put it it will go up and down and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.020 
and put it it will go up and down and
still<00:04:40.740> stay<00:04:40.980> connected<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.760> that's<00:04:44.760> about<00:04:44.880> it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
still stay connected so that's about it

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.170 
still stay connected so that's about it
so<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.960> guys<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.230> further<00:04:46.710> questions<00:04:47.180> I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
so if you guys have further questions I

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.600 
so if you guys have further questions I
will<00:04:48.630> post<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.760> link<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.680> ELC<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.280> bought

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
will post the link to this ELC I bought

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.970 
will post the link to this ELC I bought
I<00:04:53.790> think<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.120> about<00:04:54.270> five<00:04:54.900> pounds<00:04:55.470> from<00:04:55.680> a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
I think it's about five pounds from a

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.960 
I think it's about five pounds from a
website<00:04:56.160> called<00:04:56.670> RS<00:04:57.740> wwm<00:04:58.740> they<00:04:59.670> do<00:04:59.730> like

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
website called RS wwm they do like

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.130 
website called RS wwm they do like
electrical<00:05:00.390> components<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:00.960> bits<00:05:01.080> and

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
electrical components and bits and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.450 
electrical components and bits and
pieces<00:05:01.230> like<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.890> think<00:05:02.250> they'll

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
pieces like that I think they'll

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.310 
pieces like that I think they'll
probably<00:05:02.490> so<00:05:02.850> inverters<00:05:03.390> but<00:05:03.690> I<00:05:03.870> didn't<00:05:04.140> need

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
probably so inverters but I didn't need

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.000 
probably so inverters but I didn't need
obviously<00:05:04.860> need<00:05:05.250> long<00:05:05.430> as<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.610> had<00:05:05.760> some<00:05:07.010> but

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
obviously need long as I had some but

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.640 
obviously need long as I had some but
I'm<00:05:08.760> sure<00:05:08.940> they<00:05:09.060> do<00:05:09.120> those<00:05:09.420> as<00:05:09.630> well<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.050> so

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
I'm sure they do those as well and so

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.760 
I'm sure they do those as well and so
you<00:05:10.680> guys<00:05:10.890> any<00:05:11.040> questions<00:05:11.190> let<00:05:11.640> me<00:05:11.670> know
