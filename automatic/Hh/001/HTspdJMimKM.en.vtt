it's<00:00:34.110> quite<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> difficult<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> give<00:00:34.890> tips

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it's quite a difficult one to give tips

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's quite a difficult one to give tips
on<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.940> based<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.420> your<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:37.110> style

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
on it's really based on your game style

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400 
on it's really based on your game style
or<00:00:37.649> your<00:00:37.950> play<00:00:38.820> style<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.750> I'd<00:00:40.050> count

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
or your play style you know so I'd count

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
or your play style you know so I'd count
myself<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> rusher<00:00:41.760> than<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
myself as more of a rusher than I'm a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
myself as more of a rusher than I'm a
camper<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.079> if<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> are<00:00:43.530> more<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.860> camp<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
camper but if you are more of a camp and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
camper but if you are more of a camp and
player<00:00:44.520> than<00:00:44.760> Russians<00:00:45.120> gonna<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> more

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
player than Russians gonna be more

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.790 
player than Russians gonna be more
difficult<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.530> because

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
difficult for you to get into because

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
difficult for you to get into because
obviously<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.000> stick<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.450> what<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.719> used

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
obviously you stick with what you used

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
obviously you stick with what you used
to<00:00:48.930> pretty<00:00:49.140> much<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.500> yes<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.489> quite<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to pretty much don't yes so it's quite a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.869 
to pretty much don't yes so it's quite a
difficult<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.449> used<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.840> now

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
difficult one to get used to now

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.119 
difficult one to get used to now
probably<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.480> best<00:00:54.719> way<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> rush<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.980> get

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
probably the best way to rush or to get

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
probably the best way to rush or to get
used<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> rushing<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.570> go

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
used to rushing it's to pretty much go

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
used to rushing it's to pretty much go
from<00:00:58.440> start<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> map<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.520> around

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
from start the map all the way around

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.950 
from start the map all the way around
the<00:00:59.820> outside<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> map<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the outside of the map now I'm not in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.939 
the outside of the map now I'm not in
the<00:01:01.050> middle<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.770> middle

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the middle if you go for the middle

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
the middle if you go for the middle
you're<00:01:02.430> gonna<00:01:02.520> find<00:01:02.760> other<00:01:03.059> players<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.449> are

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
you're gonna find other players that are

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
you're gonna find other players that are
also<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.379> are<00:01:04.439> also<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> middle

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
also that are also going for the middle

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.740 
also that are also going for the middle
you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> convince<00:01:06.420> people

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
you know so you got to convince people

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
you know so you got to convince people
but<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:06.930> you're<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.380> around<00:01:07.530> the

you watching team deathmatch now's the
spawns<00:01:23.759> flip<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.659> objective<00:01:25.229> game

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
spawns flip but I'm more objective game

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
spawns flip but I'm more objective game
modes<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.710> demolition<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> actually

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
modes like demolition you can actually

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.520 
modes like demolition you can actually
be<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.420> spawn<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> watch<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.259> spawn

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
be in their spawn and watch them spawn

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990 
be in their spawn and watch them spawn
and<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> from<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> earth<00:01:29.549> from

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and pretty much it from the earth from

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
and pretty much it from the earth from
the<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.049> straight<00:01:31.259> away

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the back you know it was straight away

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.260 
the back you know it was straight away
so<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:32.579> good<00:01:32.850> rush<00:01:33.030> turning

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so it's really really good rush turning

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
so it's really really good rush turning
and<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> does<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> while<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.770> used<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and it does take a while to get used to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
and it does take a while to get used to
you<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.509> die

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you are probably what you're gonna die

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
you are probably what you're gonna die
more<00:01:36.990> rushing<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:38.579> thing

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
more rushing that's one one little thing

more rushing that's one one little thing
that<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> should<00:01:39.119> probably<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:39.540> into

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that you should probably take into

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
that you should probably take into
