to 20 million years I expect all

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.589 
to 20 million years I expect all
doomsday<00:02:17.319> experts<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.340> keep<00:02:18.880> quiet<00:02:19.150> until

doomsday experts to keep quiet until

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.760 
doomsday experts to keep quiet until
then<00:02:20.319> thank<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.010> very<00:02:21.250> much

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
then thank you very much

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.550 
then thank you very much
what<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:24.030> happening<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.750> our

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
what is really happening is that our

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.910 
what is really happening is that our
solar<00:02:26.130> system<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.110> lining<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.740> different

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
solar system is lining up in a different

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.060 
solar system is lining up in a different
way<00:02:29.400> our<00:02:29.900> planets<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.050> lining<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
way our planets are lining up on the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.820 
way our planets are lining up on the
same<00:02:32.580> horizontal<00:02:33.210> play<00:02:34.050> let<00:02:34.410> me<00:02:34.530> show<00:02:34.800> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
same horizontal play let me show you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280 
same horizontal play let me show you
this<00:02:35.100> by<00:02:35.310> centering<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.210> view<00:02:36.420> onto<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.050> Sun

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
this by centering the view onto the Sun

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.430 
this by centering the view onto the Sun
and<00:02:37.670> zooming<00:02:38.670> backwards<00:02:43.520> here's<00:02:44.520> our<00:02:44.700> son<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and zooming backwards here's our son and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.640 
and zooming backwards here's our son and
as<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.890> zoom<00:02:46.920> backwards<00:02:47.700> we<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.540> see<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.380> I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
as we zoom backwards we will see what I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.400 
as we zoom backwards we will see what I
mean<00:02:50.040> here's<00:02:50.700> our<00:02:50.880> son<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:51.840> orbits

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
mean here's our son and the first orbits

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.390 
mean here's our son and the first orbits
we<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.300> mercury<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:55.470> here's<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> Sun<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
we have mercury so here's the Sun and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
we have mercury so here's the Sun and
here's<00:02:57.240> nurturing<00:02:57.870> okay<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.690> then<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:00.900> move

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
here's nurturing okay and then we move

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.170 
here's nurturing okay and then we move
further<00:03:01.740> backwards<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:07.140> can

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
further backwards so that we can

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.430 
further backwards so that we can
focus<00:03:10.019> our<00:03:10.439> view<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.489> Venus<00:03:12.150> here's<00:03:12.870> Venus

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
focus our view on Venus here's Venus

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.589 
focus our view on Venus here's Venus
ok

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
ok

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.670 
ok
and<00:03:18.580> here's<00:03:19.580> earth<00:03:20.269> earth<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.319> actually

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
and here's earth earth is actually

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.380 
and here's earth earth is actually
behind<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.099> Sun<00:03:22.340> they're<00:03:22.580> on<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.819> same<00:03:23.030> line

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
behind the Sun they're on the same line

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.910 
behind the Sun they're on the same line
them<00:03:23.830> Mars<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:24.980> right<00:03:25.310> here<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.379> see<00:03:27.709> what

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
them Mars is right here so you see what

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.449 
them Mars is right here so you see what
I'm<00:03:28.040> speaking<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.360> all<00:03:29.599> our<00:03:30.459> planets

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
I'm speaking of is that all our planets

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.150 
I'm speaking of is that all our planets
are<00:03:32.319> actually<00:03:33.319> resting<00:03:34.090> more<00:03:35.090> or<00:03:35.360> less<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
are actually resting more or less on the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.690

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
disasters at all in fact if you look at

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.780 
disasters at all in fact if you look at
it<00:03:55.489> from<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.450> top<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:57.049> can<00:03:57.650> see<00:03:57.709> our<00:03:58.069> planets

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
it from the top you can see our planets

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.780 
it from the top you can see our planets
are<00:03:58.970> still<00:03:59.420> pretty<00:03:59.780> much<00:04:00.129> in<00:04:01.129> different

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
are still pretty much in different

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.599 
are still pretty much in different
positions<00:04:02.920> seen<00:04:03.920> from<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.519> top<00:04:04.879> okay<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.170> I

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
positions seen from the top okay so I

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.780 
positions seen from the top okay so I
think<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.790> can<00:04:07.819> rest<00:04:08.209> assured<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:10.370> can
