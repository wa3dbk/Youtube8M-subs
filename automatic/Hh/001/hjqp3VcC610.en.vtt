you go okay and that's the roundabout
watch<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.280> mange<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> central

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
watch the mange is to put the central

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.660 
watch the mange is to put the central
top<00:02:36.290> off<00:02:36.550> which<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:39.010> upside<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:40.130> dish<00:02:40.370> and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
top off which is a upside down dish and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.860 
top off which is a upside down dish and
then<00:02:42.430> one<00:02:43.430> by<00:02:43.459> one<00:02:44.560> flat<00:02:45.560> tile<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:47.239> that's<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
then one by one flat tile and that's the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.100 
then one by one flat tile and that's the
roundabout<00:02:48.230> structure<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.900> pleased<00:02:51.080> with

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
roundabout structure really pleased with

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.080 
roundabout structure really pleased with
that<00:02:51.230> design<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.650> think<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.100> looks<00:02:52.130> great<00:02:52.520> and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
that design I think it looks great and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.110 
that design I think it looks great and
get<00:02:53.300> quite<00:02:53.540> well<00:02:56.440> okay<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.250> put<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.790> back<00:02:58.940> in

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
get quite well okay so put it back in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.030 
get quite well okay so put it back in
our<00:02:59.239> scene<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.080> plates<00:03:03.790> touch<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
our scene so the plates touch on to the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.080 
our scene so the plates touch on to the
turntable<00:03:07.640> right<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:09.340> as<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.519> see<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.850> that's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
turntable right so as you see it that's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
turntable right so as you see it that's
clear<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.569> regrets<00:03:13.299> we've<00:03:14.299> created<00:03:14.569> although

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
clear the regrets we've created although

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.699 
clear the regrets we've created although
overgrown<00:03:16.069> grass<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:17.290> abandoned<00:03:18.290> flavor

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:39.009 

well<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.239> bar<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.769> also<00:03:37.870> that's<00:03:38.870> how

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
well and the the bar and also that's how

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.180 
well and the the bar and also that's how
we<00:03:39.079> created<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.590> roundabout<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.070> our

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
we created the roundabout in our

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.270
