there's more than meets the eye to this

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.560 
there's more than meets the eye to this
and<00:00:10.860> it's<00:00:11.040> time<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> jump<00:00:11.550> right<00:00:11.759> into<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.120> now

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and it's time to jump right into it now

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360 
and it's time to jump right into it now
let's<00:00:12.809> jump<00:00:13.170> some<00:00:13.380> barrels<00:00:13.799> kill<00:00:14.190> some

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
let's jump some barrels kill some

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.799 
let's jump some barrels kill some
goombas<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.210> where<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.389> theory<00:00:15.630> takes

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
goombas and see where this theory takes

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
goombas and see where this theory takes
us<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> theory<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> very<00:00:17.460> interesting

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699

us now this theory is a very interesting
theory<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.150> comes<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> me<00:00:18.480> from<00:00:18.660> an

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
theory and it comes to me from an

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.390 
theory and it comes to me from an
article<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.320> reddit<00:00:19.830> I'll<00:00:19.949> go<00:00:20.100> ahead<00:00:20.160> and

are the same age as Donkey Kong jr. or
the<00:01:37.409> DK<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> games

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the DK that we know in all the games

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
the DK that we know in all the games
this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.090> evident<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.860> game

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this is evident because in this game

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
this is evident because in this game
which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> yoshi<00:01:41.700> island<00:01:41.939> DS<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
which is yoshi island DS all the all the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
which is yoshi island DS all the all the
Mario<00:01:44.610> characters<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.540> peach<00:01:45.840> Wario

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
Mario characters you know peach Wario

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
Mario characters you know peach Wario
Bowser<00:01:46.619> Mario<00:01:47.490> DK<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.659> babies<00:01:49.110> all

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
Bowser Mario DK are all babies all

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.770 
Bowser Mario DK are all babies all
around<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.860> same<00:01:50.070> age<00:01:50.130> roughly<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.630> this

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
around the same age roughly so this

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
around the same age roughly so this
basically<00:01:52.110> puts<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
basically puts them all at about the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
basically puts them all at about the
same<00:01:53.430> age<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.329> basically<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.780> gather

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
same age and that's basically we gather

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
same age and that's basically we gather
from<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> game<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.310> also<00:01:56.460> good<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
from this game and it's also good to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
from this game and it's also good to
note<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.630> would<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.840> impossible<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.710> an

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
note that it would be impossible for an

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
note that it would be impossible for an
adult<00:01:59.040> Mario<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.149> be<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> game<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.439> an

not a Mario we see in all future Mario
games<00:02:47.330> either<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.380> actually<00:02:49.010> jump<00:02:49.610> man

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
games either this is actually jump man

is<00:02:52.220> actually<00:02:52.310> jump<00:02:52.760> man<00:02:53.000> we'll<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.360> why

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
is actually jump man we'll get to why

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.720 
is actually jump man we'll get to why
that's<00:02:53.600> important<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.020> just<00:02:54.050> one<00:02:54.320> second<00:02:54.730> now

our theory that that you know the Mario

our theory that that you know the Mario
in<00:06:11.630> this<00:06:11.720> game<00:06:11.900> is<00:06:12.080> not<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.380> Mario<00:06:12.650> from<00:06:12.770> our

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
in this game is not the Mario from our

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.560 
in this game is not the Mario from our
new<00:06:12.980> games<00:06:13.190> because<00:06:13.550> they're<00:06:13.730> in<00:06:13.940> fact<00:06:14.360> his

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
new games because they're in fact his

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.120 
new games because they're in fact his
son<00:06:14.600> is<00:06:15.020> you<00:06:15.110> see<00:06:15.230> right<00:06:15.350> here<00:06:15.500> Mario<00:06:16.010> is<00:06:16.100> a

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
son is you see right here Mario is a

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.860 
son is you see right here Mario is a
halo<00:06:16.370> of<00:06:16.460> his<00:06:16.670> head<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:17.060> here<00:06:17.240> is<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.360> closer<00:06:17.720> up

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
halo of his head and here is a closer up

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.780 
halo of his head and here is a closer up
image<00:06:18.320> of<00:06:18.470> what<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.650> is<00:06:19.040> as<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.640> can<00:06:19.670> see

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
image of what that is as you can see

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.660 
image of what that is as you can see
Mario<00:06:20.660> or<00:06:20.990> who<00:06:21.590> we<00:06:21.710> thought<00:06:21.860> was<00:06:21.980> Mario<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.580> in
