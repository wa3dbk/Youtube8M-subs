then you know I can do fun stuff like
that<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> it'll<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.560> cool<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.579> I

that and it'll be very cool and then I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
that and it'll be very cool and then I
can<00:01:44.850> work<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:45.630> easily<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.799> will

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can work on it very easily so it will

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
can work on it very easily so it will
take<00:01:47.070> what<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.399> normally<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:48.030> someone

like me you know hours upon hours upon
hours<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:52.020> work<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.399> even<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.970> simple

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
hours of work to do even a simple

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
hours of work to do even a simple
animated<00:01:55.049> short<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:56.060> possibly<00:01:57.060> knock<00:01:57.299> out

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
animated short I can possibly knock out

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
animated short I can possibly knock out
a<00:01:57.810> simple<00:01:58.259> animated<00:01:58.799> short<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.310> like

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
a simple animated short that's like

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.030 
a simple animated short that's like
fifteen<00:02:00.149> or<00:02:00.270> thirty<00:02:00.299> seconds<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.320> like

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
fifteen or thirty seconds and just like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
fifteen or thirty seconds and just like
an<00:02:02.189> hour<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.579> two<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.869> be

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
an hour or two so that's just gonna be

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.359 
an hour or two so that's just gonna be
tremendous<00:02:04.140> maybe<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.130> long

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
tremendous maybe not even that long

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789 
tremendous maybe not even that long
because<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.869> allowing<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.380> me

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
because of what this is allowing for me

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
because of what this is allowing for me
so<00:02:08.220> especially<00:02:08.489> since<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.390> ahead<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so especially since I can go ahead and I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.029 
so especially since I can go ahead and I
could<00:02:09.959> take<00:02:10.170> something<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.649> I've<00:02:10.739> already

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
could take something that I've already

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.010 
could take something that I've already
made<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.090> actually<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.569> make<00:02:12.780> some

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
made so I'm actually gonna make some

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.430 
made so I'm actually gonna make some
character

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
character

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.020 
character
design<00:02:13.620> stuff<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:13.980> advance<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.730> coming

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
design stuff in advance of this coming

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.820 
design stuff in advance of this coming
out<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.510> probably<00:02:15.630> gonna<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.930> summer<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
out it's probably gonna be summer of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.790 
out it's probably gonna be summer of
2015<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.720> come<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:18.930> that's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
2015 that this is gonna come out that's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.890 
2015 that this is gonna come out that's
not<00:02:19.980> hard<00:02:20.370> date<00:02:20.940> from<00:02:21.180> Adobe<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:21.630> haven't

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
not hard date from Adobe they haven't

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
not hard date from Adobe they haven't
given<00:02:22.020> us<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:23.550> that's<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.910> I'm

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
given us one but that's what I'm

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.350 
given us one but that's what I'm
anticipating<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> I'm<00:02:26.340> thinking<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
anticipating so I'm thinking all of the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660 
anticipating so I'm thinking all of the
CC<00:02:27.660> 2015<00:02:28.020> stuff<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.560> gonna<00:02:28.710> be<00:02:28.800> probably<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
CC 2015 stuff is gonna be probably the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.580 
CC 2015 stuff is gonna be probably the
mid<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.210> end<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.510> summer<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:31.170> great<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.530> do

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
mid or end of summer be great if they do

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.120 
mid or end of summer be great if they do
it<00:02:31.800> by<00:02:31.890> June<00:02:32.220> for<00:02:32.460> my<00:02:32.580> birthday<00:02:32.790> um<00:02:33.380> but<00:02:34.380> that's

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.470 
it by June for my birthday um but that's
what<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.460> thinking<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.880> gonna<00:02:36.000> happen<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.390> I'm

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what I'm thinking is gonna happen so I'm

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240 
what I'm thinking is gonna happen so I'm
gonna<00:02:36.570> make<00:02:36.840> some<00:02:37.050> stuff<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.380> advance<00:02:37.470> then

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I'm going to and I'm probably doing this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.330 
I'm going to and I'm probably doing this
stuff<00:02:39.990> as<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> tutorial<00:02:40.710> once<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.010> get<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> hang

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
stuff as a tutorial once I get the hang

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.630 
stuff as a tutorial once I get the hang
of<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.840> go<00:02:42.960> ahead<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.470> run<00:02:44.160> through<00:02:44.370> do

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
of it just go ahead and run through do

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.610 
of it just go ahead and run through do
the<00:02:44.760> actual<00:02:45.150> acting<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.900> voice<00:02:46.050> acting<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the actual acting and voice acting and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.260 
the actual acting and voice acting and
everything<00:02:46.770> acted<00:02:47.400> all<00:02:47.520> out<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.880> do

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
everything acted all out and do

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.790 
everything acted all out and do
basically<00:02:48.690> some<00:02:48.960> still<00:02:49.200> talking<00:02:49.620> head

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
basically some still talking head

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.010 
basically some still talking head
animation<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.460> start<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.900> know

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
animation to start and then you know

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.870 
animation to start and then you know
build<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.590> evolve<00:02:52.890> things<00:02:53.160> from<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:53.520> so

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
build and evolve things from there so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.670 
build and evolve things from there so
again<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.210> think<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.600> super<00:02:54.990> cool<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> think

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
again I think this is super cool I think

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.750 
again I think this is super cool I think
this<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.920> tremendous<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.610> gonna

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
this is tremendous I think it's gonna

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220 
this is tremendous I think it's gonna
get<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.150> many<00:02:57.330> people<00:02:57.690> into<00:02:57.840> animation

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
get so many people into animation

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.740 
get so many people into animation
especially<00:02:58.800> young<00:02:59.460> people<00:02:59.490> I<00:03:00.180> know<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.450> lot<00:03:00.720> of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
especially young people I know a lot of

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
especially young people I know a lot of
people<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.650> talked<00:03:02.040> trash<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.820> Creative

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that I think that's huge I think that's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.280 
that I think that's huge I think that's
important<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.760> think<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.660> concept<00:03:34.170> of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
important I think that the concept of

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.190 
important I think that the concept of
owning<00:03:34.709> software<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.400> getting<00:03:35.580> outdated<00:03:36.200> but

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
owning software is getting outdated but

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.540 
owning software is getting outdated but
again<00:03:37.380> that's<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.650> whole<00:03:37.800> nother<00:03:37.950> argument

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
again that's a whole nother argument

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.550 
again that's a whole nother argument
I'll<00:03:38.670> probably<00:03:38.910> do<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.150> 2015<00:03:39.900> video<00:03:40.230> about<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
I'll probably do a 2015 video about the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.460 
I'll probably do a 2015 video about the
Creative<00:03:40.860> Cloud<00:03:41.010> debate<00:03:41.400> again<00:03:41.880> um<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:43.260> I
