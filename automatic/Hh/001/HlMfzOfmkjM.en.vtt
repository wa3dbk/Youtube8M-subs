00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone today, I got to the beach 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.309
 beautiful brave ancient city of Chersonese 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.290
 or rather that it is two cities I remained 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.980
 did not take a tour to walk on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.570
 hisense 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 just find it right now 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.100
 some good place on the beach 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 and ulyagus reads for some reason considered 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.750
 sorry for these people on trips which 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.060
 comes to see again walk by 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 Chersonesos and honestly it's easy 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 the tour is all that remains of the city 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.820
 plus looking for church love to walk 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.579
 wander along these paths and represent 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.950
 when people lived before each year 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
 archaeologists come from all over the world and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 doing excavations always dreamed of something 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.350
 I did not find anything here but 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.809
 my dad he betrayed his he very much 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.340
 of our things not on the surface but under 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.149
 water so we have this 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.149
 a kind of home museum 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 you can still see shards on the beach 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.840
 amfar sometimes even with particles 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 gold is very small get rich 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 impossible to collect nitrogen anyway 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.060
 nice and drag that lucida for memory 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.760
 kirsana есci and wild stony beaches 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.190
 on the other side there is a children's beach and 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.490
 juicy coves there water so you know not 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.500
 the sea ​​is very clean here 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.290
 quietly don't eat your favorite bear 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.100
 under the rocks after us 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.410
 cleared of balozhi 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.570
 you live the other members should not 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.270
 I want to yesterday was very heavy rain 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.290
 this may contribute to the decoction therefore 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.989
 probably when you 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.770
 children do you smell the rotting smell already 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.870
 seaweed 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.760
 I still like to watch 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.930
 how to pick up the food for some reason 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.239
 kinematics close your palms 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.209
 imagine for the station minus this 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.549
 the beach is full of age here 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.440
 very much war that very much will not hide flies 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.380
 on the feet glide water 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.810
 would you look at it I'm only here there 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.580
 the sandwich is better immediately come to you it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 relatives and and they are not from 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.049
 shy indie music plaid and they 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.049
 get down and take 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.760
 amazingly see on the subjects of the ancient 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.540
 cities that red what you see class 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.349
 to me these are remnants of the city of Chersonesos and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:15.720
 even such tiled sketches 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:17.010
 I lost here and see more 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.319
 all this was 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:28.879
 and this is most likely to download marine 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.650
 water but very similar to the andrew pen and 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.329
 today the thing that never did 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.329
 that you are the first to see 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.670
 so how 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.260
 i be pop up 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:20.030
 let's leave everything to take a little past eight 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.359
 or 2 seconds here and pretty them 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.359
 lot
