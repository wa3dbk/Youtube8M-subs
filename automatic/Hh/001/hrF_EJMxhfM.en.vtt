00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
in your assessment of pediatric patients

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.470 
in your assessment of pediatric patients
so<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.760> talking<00:00:35.910> about<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.390> we

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so what are we talking about when we

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.459 
so what are we talking about when we
look<00:00:36.510> at<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> pediatric<00:00:37.050> assessment

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
look at the pediatric assessment

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.459 
look at the pediatric assessment
triangle<00:00:38.329> first<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.079> something

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
triangle first of all it's something

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.229 
triangle first of all it's something
you're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> use<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.520> initial

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you're going to use in your initial

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're going to use in your initial
assessment<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.530> easy<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.219> it's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
assessment and it's easy to use it's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.569 
assessment and it's easy to use it's
before<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> patient<00:00:46.860> it's

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
before you even get to the patient it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.029 
before you even get to the patient it's
non-invasive<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.320> even<00:00:49.739> actually

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
non-invasive you don't even actually

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
non-invasive you don't even actually
touch<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> patient<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.660> using<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
touch the patient when using the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
touch the patient when using the
pediatric<00:00:52.649> assessment<00:00:52.770> triangle<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.760> that's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pediatric assessment triangle and that's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.479 
pediatric assessment triangle and that's
one<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> things<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> makes<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
one of the things that makes it so

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
one of the things that makes it so
amazingly<00:00:56.489> valuable<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.660> assessing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
amazingly valuable for assessing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
amazingly valuable for assessing
pediatric<00:00:59.250> patients<00:00:59.640> especially<00:00:59.820> there's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
pediatric patients especially there's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.779 
pediatric patients especially there's
very<00:01:00.570> young<00:01:00.870> patients<00:01:01.379> who<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.430> lot<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
very young patients who have a lot of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
very young patients who have a lot of
stranger<00:01:03.750> anxiety<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.589> part<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.489> their<00:01:05.670> normal

stranger anxiety as part of their normal
development

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
development

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
development
it's<00:01:08.130> non-threatening<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.869> do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it's non-threatening because you can do

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
it's non-threatening because you can do
it<00:01:10.049> from<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.470> distance<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:11.189> across<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> room

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it from a distance from across the room

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
it from a distance from across the room
without<00:01:12.330> ever<00:01:12.720> approaching<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.590> patients

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
without ever approaching these patients

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.080 
without ever approaching these patients
and<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.450> easy<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.090> I'm

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and it's really easy to do now I'm

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
and it's really easy to do now I'm
serious<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> pediatric

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
serious it really is the pediatric

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
serious it really is the pediatric
assessment<00:01:23.460> triangle<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.450> based<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
assessment triangle is based on you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.850 
assessment triangle is based on you
using<00:01:26.790> three<00:01:27.240> variables<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> determine

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
using three variables to determine

using three variables to determine
whether<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.610> sick<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.750> sick

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
whether you have a sick or not sick

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
whether you have a sick or not sick
patient<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.799> by<00:01:32.159> sick<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.670> sick<00:01:32.700> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
patient and by sick or not sick we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
patient and by sick or not sick we
really<00:01:33.329> mean<00:01:33.509> critical<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.650> critical<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
really mean critical or not critical is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.890 
really mean critical or not critical is
this<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> patient<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> you're<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.689> be

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this a patient that you're gonna be

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.990 
this a patient that you're gonna be
really<00:01:37.110> loading<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> running<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
not sick the three variables are

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.280 
not sick the three variables are
appearance<00:01:49.070> work<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.250> breathing<00:01:50.820> and

appearance work of breathing and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
appearance work of breathing and
circulation<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:53.040> these<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.390> three

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
circulation and these are the three

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
circulation and these are the three
things<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.860> assess<00:01:56.219> very<00:01:56.640> well

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
things you can actually assess very well

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
things you can actually assess very well
without<00:01:57.390> ever<00:01:57.810> getting<00:01:58.049> too<00:01:58.380> awful<00:01:58.740> close<00:01:58.920> to

without ever getting too awful close to
the<00:01:59.189> patient<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.729> before<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> start<00:02:00.659> using

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the patient and before you start using
