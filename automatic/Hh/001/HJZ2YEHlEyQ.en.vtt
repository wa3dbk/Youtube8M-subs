those eight hours so yeah and I've
improved<00:02:11.760> actually<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.480> those<00:02:12.630> two<00:02:13.380> hours

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
improved actually in those two hours

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
improved actually in those two hours
that<00:02:13.950> I've<00:02:14.070> had<00:02:14.250> since<00:02:14.280> I've<00:02:14.730> got<00:02:14.880> back<00:02:15.090> from

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
holidays so that's a good sign hopefully

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.020 
holidays so that's a good sign hopefully
when<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.050> time<00:02:19.470> comes<00:02:19.800> I'll<00:02:20.070> be<00:02:20.100> super

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
when the time comes I'll be super

when the time comes I'll be super
confident<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.020> would<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.230> able<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.470> deal

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
that and then I've got other my for

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.449 
that and then I've got other my for
maneuvers<00:02:56.489> which<00:02:56.930> I'm<00:02:57.930> okay<00:02:58.320> with<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.799> just

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
maneuvers which I'm okay with I just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.250 
maneuvers which I'm okay with I just
need<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> make<00:02:59.880> perfect<00:03:00.450> them<00:03:00.690> at<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> moment

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
need to make perfect them at the moment

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.949 
need to make perfect them at the moment
and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:03.060> only<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.360> one<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.660> those

and I think you only do one of those

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.680 
and I think you only do one of those
maneuvers<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:04.860> i<00:03:05.340> need<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.940> perfect<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.540> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
maneuvers but i need to perfect all of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.199 
maneuvers but i need to perfect all of
them<00:03:06.840> as<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.890> expect

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
them as I don't know what to expect

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.120 
them as I don't know what to expect
really<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.420> I'm<00:03:09.540> at<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.230> test<00:03:10.470> center<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
really when I'm at the test center and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.250 
really when I'm at the test center and
like<00:03:11.610> these<00:03:11.790> drips<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> car<00:03:12.480> no<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.170> the

like these drips in the car no and the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.510 
like these drips in the car no and the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
examiners in the car and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.070 
examiners in the car and
I<00:03:15.580> just<00:03:16.330> don't<00:03:16.480> know<00:03:16.540> how<00:03:16.690> I'm<00:03:16.720> gonna<00:03:16.840> cope

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
I just don't know how I'm gonna cope

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.630 
I just don't know how I'm gonna cope
with<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:17.680> obviously<00:03:17.920> if<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.490> watch

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
with it because obviously if you watch

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.760 
with it because obviously if you watch
my<00:03:18.670> videos<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.900> know<00:03:20.020> I<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.350> anxiety<00:03:20.500> and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
my videos you know I have anxiety and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.530 
my videos you know I have anxiety and
it's<00:03:23.770> gonna<00:03:24.010> kick<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.460> pretty<00:03:24.820> badly<00:03:25.090> I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
it's gonna kick in pretty badly I

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.040 
it's gonna kick in pretty badly I
suspect<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:27.400> I'm<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.940> try<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.360> do<00:03:28.840> some

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
suspect but I'm going to try and do some

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.640 
suspect but I'm going to try and do some
like<00:03:29.290> breathing<00:03:29.860> exercises<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:31.350> yoga<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
like breathing exercises and yoga and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.840 
like breathing exercises and yoga and
now<00:03:33.190> at<00:03:33.850> what's<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.180> called<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:35.850> meditation

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
now at what's it called the meditation

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.630 
now at what's it called the meditation
so<00:03:37.630> hopefully<00:03:38.170> when<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.560> come<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:39.010> I'll<00:03:39.430> be

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
so hopefully when I come to it I'll be

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.100 
so hopefully when I come to it I'll be
nice<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.030> calm<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:40.480> I'll<00:03:40.540> be<00:03:40.630> able<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.930> just

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
nice and calm and I'll be able to just

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.760 
nice and calm and I'll be able to just
do<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.590> without<00:03:41.710> any<00:03:42.010> thoughts<00:03:43.500> may<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> don't

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
do it without any thoughts may I don't

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.320 
do it without any thoughts may I don't
might<00:03:44.890> have<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.160> like<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> few<00:03:45.580> miners<00:03:46.090> that's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
might have it like a few miners that's

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.680 
might have it like a few miners that's
fine<00:03:46.600> if<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.020> have<00:03:47.170> like<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.350> huge<00:03:47.800> major<00:03:48.790> fault

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
fine if I have like a huge major fault

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.860 
fine if I have like a huge major fault
then<00:03:50.410> i'll<00:03:50.590> probably<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:51.100> cry<00:03:51.460> I<00:03:51.910> really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
then i'll probably just cry I really

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.120 
then i'll probably just cry I really

remember<00:04:20.919> my<00:04:21.669> next-door<00:04:21.969> neighbor<00:04:22.060> was

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360
