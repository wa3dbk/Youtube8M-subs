rushing the past or well he's covering
well<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:22.109> think<00:02:22.379> he's<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.519> know<00:02:23.579> he's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
well I just think he's a you know he's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.129 
well I just think he's a you know he's
done<00:02:23.909> everything<00:02:24.329> he<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.569> since<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> start

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
done everything he can since the start

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.360 
done everything he can since the start
of<00:02:25.200> training<00:02:25.349> camp<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.769> be<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:25.950> best<00:02:26.129> player

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
of training camp to be the best player

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.000 
of training camp to be the best player
that<00:02:26.400> he<00:02:26.639> can<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.909> this<00:02:27.090> year<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.989> think<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that he can be this year and I think the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.140 
that he can be this year and I think the
evidence<00:02:29.189> is<00:02:29.340> on<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.609> field<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.909> way<00:02:30.030> he's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
evidence is on the field the way he's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.649 
evidence is on the field the way he's
planning<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.260> working<00:02:31.500> with<00:02:31.769> Bill<00:02:32.629> you<00:02:33.629> know
