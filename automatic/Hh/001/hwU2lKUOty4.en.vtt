units there's just new changes just

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290 
units there's just new changes just
changes<00:02:31.379> everywhere<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.980> actually<00:02:32.910> six

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
changes everywhere this actually six

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.470 
changes everywhere this actually six
starting<00:02:34.069> miners<00:02:35.069> unlike<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> previous<00:02:36.000> four

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
starting miners unlike the previous four

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.070 
starting miners unlike the previous four
and<00:02:36.840> each<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.440> gathers<00:02:37.830> five<00:02:38.790> minerals<00:02:39.300> so

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and each one gathers five minerals so

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.350 
and each one gathers five minerals so
basically<00:02:40.739> they<00:02:40.890> gather<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.550> lot<00:02:41.760> faster<00:02:42.209> than

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
basically they gather a lot faster than

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.860 
basically they gather a lot faster than
before<00:02:42.599> because<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.200> only<00:02:43.379> hold<00:02:43.530> five<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
before because they only hold five and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.199 
before because they only hold five and
yeah<00:02:45.870> that's<00:02:46.370> there's<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.459> lot<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> changes

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
yeah that's there's a lot of changes

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.059 
yeah that's there's a lot of changes
this<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.930> Queen<00:02:49.379> right<00:02:49.410> here<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.860> new

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
this this Queen right here this new

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.850 
this this Queen right here this new
macro<00:02:50.370> mechanics<00:02:50.970> everywhere<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.650> third

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
macro mechanics everywhere the third

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.670 
macro mechanics everywhere the third
have<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.129> queen<00:02:53.459> which<00:02:53.670> could<00:02:53.910> basically<00:02:54.180> have

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
have a queen which could basically have

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.910 
have a queen which could basically have
or<00:02:55.680> extra<00:02:56.160> larvae<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.819> hatchery<00:02:57.420> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
or extra larvae on the hatchery so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.399 
or extra larvae on the hatchery so
zurich<00:02:58.920> isn't<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.810> hatchery<00:03:00.810> dependent<00:03:01.319> as

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
zurich isn't as hatchery dependent as

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.869 
zurich isn't as hatchery dependent as
before<00:03:01.890> because<00:03:02.220> back<00:03:03.209> then<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:05.069> you

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
before because back then like if you

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.820 
before because back then like if you
guys<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.269> July<00:03:06.599> Zerg<00:03:06.930> July's<00:03:07.620> are

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
guys know July Zerg July's are

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.190 
guys know July Zerg July's are
popularized<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:09.180> three<00:03:09.450> hatch<00:03:09.659> food<00:03:10.019> which

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
popularized the three hatch food which

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.600 
popularized the three hatch food which
is<00:03:10.230> basically<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:12.540> fast<00:03:13.080> hatchery

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
is basically going for a fast hatchery

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.509 
is basically going for a fast hatchery
spawning<00:03:14.610> pool<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.569> hatchery<00:03:16.519> so

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
spawning pool and then a hatchery so

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.570 
spawning pool and then a hatchery so
basically<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.269> allowed<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:19.159> very<00:03:20.159> fast

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
basically that allowed for very fast

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.240 
basically that allowed for very fast
economic<00:03:21.000> boost<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:21.900> more<00:03:22.440> larvae<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.069> now

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
economic boost and more larvae but now

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.770 
economic boost and more larvae but now
zerk<00:03:23.580> doesn't<00:03:23.879> even<00:03:24.000> need<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.239> do<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.420> sir

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
zerk doesn't even need to do that sir

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.190 
zerk doesn't even need to do that sir
could<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.849> create<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.940> queen<00:03:27.299> after<00:03:27.629> making<00:03:28.049> a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
could just create a queen after making a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.300 
could just create a queen after making a
fine<00:03:28.500> pool<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.459> just<00:03:30.440> spam<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.500> larvae<00:03:32.099> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
fine pool and just spam the larvae and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.850 
fine pool and just spam the larvae and
and<00:03:32.670> I'll<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.629> able<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.080> have<00:03:34.409> the<00:03:34.590> same<00:03:34.739> effect

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and I'll be able to have the same effect

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.490 
and I'll be able to have the same effect
as<00:03:35.930> more<00:03:36.930> than<00:03:36.959> two<00:03:37.530> hatcheries<00:03:38.129> like<00:03:38.370> 2.5

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
as more than two hatcheries like 2.5

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.220 
as more than two hatcheries like 2.5
maybe<00:03:40.500> less<00:03:41.069> well<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.670> also<00:03:42.659> you<00:03:42.810> don't<00:03:42.989> need

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
maybe less well and also you don't need

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.580 
maybe less well and also you don't need
to<00:03:43.409> spend<00:03:43.739> extra<00:03:44.670> money<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.180> produce<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.900> second

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
to spend extra money to produce a second

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.370 
to spend extra money to produce a second
hatchery<00:03:46.950> or<00:03:47.129> a<00:03:47.159> third<00:03:47.400> hatchery

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
hatchery or a third hatchery

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.960 
hatchery or a third hatchery
now<00:03:50.390> playing<00:03:51.390> terran<00:03:51.980> Terence<00:03:52.980> pretty<00:03:53.640> fun

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
now playing terran Terence pretty fun

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.970 
now playing terran Terence pretty fun
and<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.540> find<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.050> turn<00:03:55.260> has<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.530> lot<00:03:55.800> more

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and I find the turn has a lot more

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.730 
and I find the turn has a lot more
diversity<00:03:56.520> in<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:56.850> game<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.740> other

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
diversity in this game then and other

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.980 
diversity in this game then and other
games<00:03:59.010> because<00:03:59.640> basically<00:03:59.850> back<00:04:00.570> then<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
games because basically back then and

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.830 
games because basically back then and
turn<00:04:01.560> versus<00:04:02.130> surrogates<00:04:02.610> basically<00:04:03.120> medics

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
turn versus surrogates basically medics

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.920 
turn versus surrogates basically medics
and<00:04:03.990> Marines<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:06.300> was<00:04:06.510> pretty

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and Marines and and that was pretty

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.170 
and Marines and and that was pretty
pretty<00:04:07.560> boring<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.220> barely<00:04:08.550> see<00:04:08.850> anyone

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
pretty boring like you barely see anyone

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.060 
pretty boring like you barely see anyone
go<00:04:09.300> max<00:04:09.540> well<00:04:10.290> actually<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.620> guess<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.920> could

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
go max well actually I guess you could

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.040 
go max well actually I guess you could
say<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.220> same<00:04:11.370> thing<00:04:11.730> about<00:04:11.760> how<00:04:12.570> starcraft

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
say the same thing about how starcraft

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.190 
say the same thing about how starcraft
is<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:13.440> now<00:04:13.850> most<00:04:14.850> people<00:04:15.000> go<00:04:15.420> biol<00:04:15.780> but

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
is right now most people go biol but

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.620 
is right now most people go biol but
it's<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.560> same<00:04:16.709> bow<00:04:17.510> combination<00:04:18.510> that

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
it's not the same bow combination that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.150 
it's not the same bow combination that
you<00:04:18.930> see<00:04:19.110> before<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:20.600> actually<00:04:21.770> yeah<00:04:22.770> yeah

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
you see before it's actually yeah yeah

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.980 
you see before it's actually yeah yeah
it's<00:04:23.280> not<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> same<00:04:23.640> as<00:04:23.880> what<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.660> see<00:04:24.840> before

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
it's not the same as what you see before

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.100 
it's not the same as what you see before
like<00:04:25.560> most<00:04:26.160> Terrans<00:04:26.700> now<00:04:27.420> in<00:04:27.570> stock<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:27.960> to

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
like most Terrans now in stock have to

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.770 
like most Terrans now in stock have to
go<00:04:28.520> Eminem<00:04:29.520> build<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.030> that's<00:04:30.210> not<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.420> same

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
go Eminem build and that's not the same

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.530 
go Eminem build and that's not the same
as<00:04:30.840> medics<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.880> Marines<00:04:32.880> that's<00:04:33.060> actually

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
as medics and Marines that's actually

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.560 
as medics and Marines that's actually
marines<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.140> marauders<00:04:34.200> right<00:04:35.010> here<00:04:35.220> oh<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
marines and marauders right here oh and

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.560 
marines and marauders right here oh and
I<00:04:37.040> I've<00:04:38.040> been<00:04:38.250> going<00:04:38.580> off<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:39.060> too<00:04:39.300> much<00:04:39.420> of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
I I've been going off and too much of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.480 
I I've been going off and too much of
attention<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.290> after<00:04:40.710> talking<00:04:40.950> about

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
attention here after talking about

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.520 
attention here after talking about
soccer<00:04:41.730> too<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.120> not<00:04:42.240> far<00:04:42.720> with<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> replay<00:04:43.260> I

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
soccer too and not far with the replay I

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.010 
soccer too and not far with the replay I
thought<00:04:44.070> anyways<00:04:44.460> there's<00:04:44.910> two<00:04:45.300> entrances<00:04:45.420> to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
thought anyways there's two entrances to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.400 
thought anyways there's two entrances to
every<00:04:46.980> main<00:04:47.160> base<00:04:47.400> here<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.090> right<00:04:48.900> now<00:04:48.930> I'm

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
every main base here and right now I'm

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.440 
every main base here and right now I'm
trying<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.980> defend<00:04:50.760> my<00:04:50.880> destructible<00:04:51.390> rocks

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
trying to defend my destructible rocks

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.200 
trying to defend my destructible rocks
by<00:04:51.840> setting<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.260> fish<00:04:52.440> tank<00:04:52.620> gear<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.310> see<00:04:54.060> if<00:04:54.150> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
by setting a fish tank gear to see if I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.580 
by setting a fish tank gear to see if I
could<00:04:54.270> outrange<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.110> roach<00:04:55.290> but

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
could outrange the roach but

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.910 
could outrange the roach but
unfortunately<00:04:56.340> for<00:04:56.610> me<00:04:56.760> each<00:04:57.180> tank<00:04:57.710> can't<00:04:58.710> out

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
unfortunately for me each tank can't out

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.080 
unfortunately for me each tank can't out
range<00:04:59.400> half<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.510> rock<00:05:00.660> two<00:05:00.870> hits<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.230> roach<00:05:02.090> so

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
range half the rock two hits a roach so

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.520 
range half the rock two hits a roach so
these<00:05:03.270> roaches<00:05:03.480> are<00:05:03.810> going<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.200> able<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.410> go

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
these roaches are going to be able to go

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.120 
these roaches are going to be able to go
in<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.890> just<00:05:05.250> destroy<00:05:06.230> is<00:05:07.230> destructible

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
in and just destroy is destructible

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.470 
in and just destroy is destructible
rocks<00:05:08.220> here

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.300 

and<00:05:13.980> so<00:05:16.110> both<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.230> Austin<00:05:17.530> going<00:05:17.680> for<00:05:17.800> lately

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
and so both the Austin going for lately

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.180 
and so both the Austin going for lately
is<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.700> barracks<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.660> factory<00:05:20.170> and<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.560> star<00:05:20.800> port

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
is a barracks a factory and a star port

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.970 
is a barracks a factory and a star port
and<00:05:21.400> basically<00:05:22.200> basically<00:05:23.200> this<00:05:23.680> allows<00:05:23.950> me

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
and basically basically this allows me

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.320 
and basically basically this allows me
to<00:05:24.450> just<00:05:25.450> go<00:05:25.900> for<00:05:26.140> fast<00:05:26.410> drops<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:28.150> might

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
to just go for fast drops and you might

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.130 
to just go for fast drops and you might
see<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.780> often<00:05:29.410> in<00:05:30.330> StarCraft<00:05:31.330> one<00:05:31.570> well

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
see this often in StarCraft one well

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.820 
see this often in StarCraft one well
maybe<00:05:32.470> not<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.710> often<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:35.050> right<00:05:35.560> here

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
maybe not that often but and right here

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.730 
maybe not that often but and right here
I'm<00:05:36.040> going<00:05:36.520> for<00:05:36.730> a<00:05:36.760> tech<00:05:36.970> lab<00:05:37.180> because<00:05:37.420> I<00:05:37.840> want

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
I'm going for a tech lab because I want

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.480 
I'm going for a tech lab because I want
to<00:05:38.860> get<00:05:39.010> out<00:05:39.220> banshees<00:05:39.970> be<00:05:40.210> able<00:05:40.360> to
