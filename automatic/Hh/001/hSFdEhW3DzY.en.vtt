00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Individualistic actors shared through a powerful debut last movie Tears 2000 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.620
 Preacher 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.620
 After four years of filming , we have come to our side through Youth Groove . 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.750
 Nevertheless, the immaculate skin was still intact. 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.400
 Bong Tae-gyu, who has done his best to become a Thai in the retro environment and the blast style. 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:33.200
 I have been baptized in flash for a long time 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.520
 In fact, in a slightly different way of acting is what I concentrated four 1 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.420
 I wanted to show it, but it was not so easy because I was in too much of a triple. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.910
 Then a good piece of work called youth groove 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.989
 I came in, of course, and my fortune is very small, but I do . 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.370
 I came to appear. 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:57.860
 I have a very talented title in a long time. 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 This foreign to ride for those who like a priority glad to leave something else 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.369
 U 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:09.080
 Director Seung-Hyun Sohn, who has been a hip-hop warrior, 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:14.090
 Cotton is on the Internet hiphappeo What really Facts 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:20.900
 4 wrong information. You can be so surprised at all of Elzogog's. 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:26.479
 I have never seen him in a karaoke room, 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.659
 Tear is very little in the film is over 160 internal tears in the film 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.430
 Personally, I thought there was no such a shocking contrast . 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:42.299
 I might like to remember just one of the many comedy starring some other shares 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:45.890
 I want you to show me something like that , 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.890
 I wrote your persuasion. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.310
 Hongiljeom Kwak Ji-min of youth groove that is slightly seounhan time to shoot Bong Tae-gyu 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.310
 I twisted it. 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:08.149
 So what I think it has something to hit him three times, so I 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:12.080
 This is always a little brat like this taken place in the sense of whether're just coming Worship 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.870
 It was easy, but now my brother is sitting in a warm, upbeat state. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:22.630
 Four because I'm not giving out of the way once was a really nice little 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.630
 So Jill Serra Bong Tae-gyu's excuse enters 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.610
 I was a kid too. 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:35.700
 The older 9 so this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:42.180
 It's not an excuse , I'm sure. No, I did not really have seven. My outfit was really short. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:46.290
 Summer was really an idol on the combined value so * I so desperately Shrek 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.330
 It's like a cat packing. 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:56.150
 If you break the nose now, you just have the breath. 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 Several times to take such a role at the time I think I did a great commitment and in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.330
 If the rhythm breaks 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.060
 In fact, I do not care what Mini does not care about 11 days 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.500
 I do not think it's going to help the moment . 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.870
 Oh, what the fuck it is, because I wrote three times to'll do that geureongeol 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.820
 In fact, the house is so big that you have to negotiate so much 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.650
 I did not think it was small. 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.650
 Yes. You still think so. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:32.430
 If we are long and short, our short stories of our short 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.430
 Not forced to come back would not miss those days because youth 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.690
 He gave me a sour taste. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:44.580
 If you go back to 20 , 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:49.530
 You know things, then I can enjoy the way to school and campus life that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:52.880
 Things like that again a little more 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.260
 I felt a lot and then 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.430
 Well, 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.880
 I wanted to tell my father . Yeah. 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.260
 In particular, Bong Tae-gyu 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.040
 A movie that will captivate the hearts of young people with their appearance in the pure innocence. 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.900
 Groove 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.900
