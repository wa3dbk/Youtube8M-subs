00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.760 

my<00:00:19.869> first<00:00:20.170> animation<00:00:20.710> tests<00:00:21.310> were<00:00:21.820> devoted<00:00:22.360> to

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
my first animation tests were devoted to

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.220 
my first animation tests were devoted to
dinosaurs<00:00:23.770> they<00:00:24.460> were<00:00:24.520> my<00:00:24.820> passion<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.630> chose<00:00:26.200> a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
dinosaurs they were my passion I chose a

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.370 
dinosaurs they were my passion I chose a
cave<00:00:26.650> bear<00:00:27.009> I<00:00:27.310> think<00:00:27.340> to<00:00:28.000> simplify<00:00:28.599> it<00:00:28.660> I<00:00:28.960> had

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
cave bear I think to simplify it I had

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.980 
cave bear I think to simplify it I had
him<00:00:29.560> back<00:00:29.830> in<00:00:30.010> my<00:00:30.039> mind<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:31.119> do<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.300> film<00:00:31.660> called

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
him back in my mind to do a film called

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.530 
him back in my mind to do a film called
evolution<00:00:32.830> showing<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.910> history<00:00:34.330> of<00:00:34.420> the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
evolution showing the history of the

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.360 
evolution showing the history of the
world<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.170> I<00:00:35.530> thought<00:00:35.769> I<00:00:35.800> would<00:00:35.980> start<00:00:36.280> with

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
world and I thought I would start with

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.170 
world and I thought I would start with
the<00:00:36.580> cave<00:00:36.850> bear<00:00:37.210> as<00:00:37.449> a<00:00:37.840> series<00:00:38.800> of<00:00:38.830> tests<00:00:39.430> my

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
the cave bear as a series of tests my

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.360 
the cave bear as a series of tests my
first<00:00:40.480> camera<00:00:40.900> I<00:00:41.080> borrowed<00:00:41.559> from<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.980> friend<00:00:42.010> of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
first camera I borrowed from a friend of

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.610 
first camera I borrowed from a friend of
mine<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.730> was<00:00:42.850> an<00:00:42.970> old<00:00:43.150> Victor<00:00:43.660> camera<00:00:44.110> it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
mine it was an old Victor camera it

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.190 
mine it was an old Victor camera it
didn't<00:00:44.920> have<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> one<00:00:45.400> frame<00:00:45.730> shaft<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.719> so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
didn't have a one frame shaft on it so

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200 
didn't have a one frame shaft on it so
he<00:00:47.320> could<00:00:47.500> take<00:00:47.680> one<00:00:47.920> picture<00:00:48.190> at<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.579> time<00:00:48.879> and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
he could take one picture at a time and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.740 
he could take one picture at a time and
I<00:00:49.840> had<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.110> tap<00:00:50.590> it<00:00:50.800> quickly<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.969> hoped<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.690> I

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
I had a tap it quickly and hoped that I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.470 
I had a tap it quickly and hoped that I
only<00:00:52.989> got<00:00:53.260> one<00:00:53.320> frame<00:00:53.860> sometimes<00:00:54.789> I<00:00:55.000> got<00:00:55.180> two

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
only got one frame sometimes I got two

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.049 
only got one frame sometimes I got two
sometimes<00:00:56.079> I<00:00:56.260> got<00:00:56.469> three<00:00:56.800> which<00:00:57.579> made<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
sometimes I got three which made the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.750 
sometimes I got three which made the
animation<00:00:58.660> very<00:00:58.899> jerky<00:00:59.350> but<00:01:00.129> in<00:01:00.280> getting<00:01:00.640> the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
animation very jerky but in getting the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.689 
animation very jerky but in getting the
rushes<00:01:01.180> back<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.690> found<00:01:02.320> it<00:01:02.500> rather

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
rushes back I found it rather

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.430 
rushes back I found it rather
fascinating<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:04.149> see<00:01:04.360> this<00:01:04.509> creature<00:01:04.839> moving

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
fascinating to see this creature moving

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:19.020 
fascinating to see this creature moving
by<00:01:05.590> itself

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.030 

I<00:01:21.480> think<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.630> first<00:01:22.810> dinosaur<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.440> made<00:01:23.770> was

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
I think the first dinosaur I made was

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.060 
I think the first dinosaur I made was
eerie<00:01:24.520> ops<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.540> then<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.810> graduated<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:27.040> the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
eerie ops and then I graduated to the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.910 
eerie ops and then I graduated to the
Stegosaurus<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.630> was<00:01:28.750> very<00:01:28.990> proud<00:01:29.320> of<00:01:29.380> it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
Stegosaurus and I was very proud of it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.790 
Stegosaurus and I was very proud of it
after<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.820> had<00:01:30.970> met<00:01:31.150> Willis<00:01:31.570> or<00:01:31.780> Bryant<00:01:32.260> he<00:01:32.530> said

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
after I had met Willis or Bryant he said

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.609 
after I had met Willis or Bryant he said
you<00:01:33.520> know<00:01:33.670> your<00:01:33.910> Stegosaurus<00:01:34.180> as<00:01:34.960> legs<00:01:35.290> look

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
you know your Stegosaurus as legs look

00:01:35.619 --> 00:02:17.180 
you know your Stegosaurus as legs look
like<00:01:35.830> sausages<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.850> better<00:01:37.479> study<00:01:37.840> Anatomy
