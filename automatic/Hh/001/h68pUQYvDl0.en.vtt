00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
I didn't think so to avoid making this

dumbbells<00:00:18.570> over<00:00:18.840> barbells<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.830> doing

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
dumbbells over barbells when I'm doing

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
dumbbells over barbells when I'm doing
my<00:00:20.130> bench<00:00:20.460> press<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> say<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.900> don't

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
my bench press not to say that I don't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.890 
my bench press not to say that I don't
use<00:00:22.529> barbells<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.460> honestly<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.660> every

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
use barbells but honestly for every

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.779 
use barbells but honestly for every
three<00:00:25.199> times<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:25.859> dumbbells<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> workout

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
three times I use dumbbells in a workout

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
three times I use dumbbells in a workout
I'll<00:00:27.000> probably<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.330> barbells<00:00:27.930> once<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.529> few

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
I'll probably use barbells once a few

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'll probably use barbells once a few
reasons<00:00:29.250> why<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> usually<00:00:30.150> offered<00:00:30.570> dumbbells

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
reasons why I usually offered dumbbells

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
reasons why I usually offered dumbbells
over<00:00:31.289> barbells<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.790> allow<00:00:33.090> for

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
over barbells are because they allow for

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.810 
over barbells are because they allow for
a<00:00:33.360> more<00:00:33.600> natural<00:00:33.710> movement<00:00:34.710> they're<00:00:35.370> safer

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a more natural movement they're safer

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
a more natural movement they're safer
when<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> don't<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> spotter<00:00:36.870> they<00:00:37.800> help

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
when you don't have a spotter they help

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889 
when you don't have a spotter they help
improve<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.730> prevent<00:00:39.210> strength<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> muscle

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
improve or prevent strength and muscle

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.470 
improve or prevent strength and muscle
imbalances<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.489> specifically<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.270> me

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
imbalances and then specifically for me

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
imbalances and then specifically for me
when<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> use<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> barbell<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.890> tend<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> feel<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
when I use a barbell I tend to feel it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
when I use a barbell I tend to feel it
more<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.940> shoulders<00:00:45.360> rather<00:00:45.629> than<00:00:45.840> my

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
more in my shoulders rather than my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
more in my shoulders rather than my
chest<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.129> next<00:00:47.430> exercise<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:48.030> did<00:00:48.210> was

chest the next exercise i did was

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
chest the next exercise i did was
incline<00:00:48.870> dumbbell<00:00:49.320> bench<00:00:49.469> press<00:00:49.670> just<00:00:50.670> like

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
with the flat press i also use dumbbells

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.920 
with the flat press i also use dumbbells
for<00:00:52.949> inclined<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> same

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
for inclined as well but at the same

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
for inclined as well but at the same
frequency<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.500> use<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> flat<00:00:56.370> presses<00:00:56.820> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
frequency i use them for flat presses in
this<00:00:57.719> particular<00:00:57.899> workout<00:00:58.680> since<00:00:59.129> i<00:00:59.280> haven't

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this particular workout since i haven't

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
this particular workout since i haven't
done<00:00:59.730> high<00:00:59.940> reps<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.510> incline<00:01:00.930> movement<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
done high reps on an incline movement in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
done high reps on an incline movement in
a<00:01:01.590> while<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.100> decided<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> pyramid<00:01:03.480> down

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a while I decided to pyramid down

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.590 
a while I decided to pyramid down
starting<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.589> 15<00:01:05.040> reps<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> ending<00:01:06.240> at<00:01:06.330> 10

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
starting at 15 reps and ending at 10

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.109 
starting at 15 reps and ending at 10
reps<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.049> last<00:01:07.350> set<00:01:07.700> most<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> time<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
reps on the last set most of the time I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
reps on the last set most of the time I
think<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> 8<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.900> 12<00:01:10.170> rep<00:01:10.500> range<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> most

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think the 8 to 12 rep range is the most

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.980 
think the 8 to 12 rep range is the most
proven<00:01:11.700> rep<00:01:12.060> range<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> comes<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
proven rep range when it comes to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630 
proven rep range when it comes to
building<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.560> even<00:01:13.590> maintaining<00:01:14.340> muscle

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
building or even maintaining muscle

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
building or even maintaining muscle
while<00:01:14.939> you're<00:01:15.090> cutting<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.290> doesn't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
while you're cutting but this doesn't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.140 
while you're cutting but this doesn't
mean<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:17.100> never<00:01:17.310> experiment<00:01:18.060> with

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
mean you should never experiment with

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
mean you should never experiment with
other<00:01:18.180> rep<00:01:18.630> ranges<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.710> still<00:01:19.979> important<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
other rep ranges it's still important to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
other rep ranges it's still important to
me<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.790> good<00:01:21.150> muscle<00:01:21.540> endurance<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
me to have good muscle endurance and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.499 
me to have good muscle endurance and
strength<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.250> although<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.700> main<00:01:24.000> purpose<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
strength so although my main purpose of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
strength so although my main purpose of
lifting<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> look<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:26.549> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
lifting is for the look I think it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
lifting is for the look I think it's
important<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> shock<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.570> body<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.020> change

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
important to shock your body and change

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
important to shock your body and change
things<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.740> occasionally<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
things up occasionally you know just to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
things up occasionally you know just to
keep<00:01:30.210> things<00:01:30.270> fresh<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> third<00:01:32.040> exercise<00:01:32.340> i

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
keep things fresh the third exercise i

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.819 
keep things fresh the third exercise i
did<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.030> single<00:01:33.479> arm<00:01:33.720> incline<00:01:34.259> cable<00:01:34.710> flyes

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
did was single arm incline cable flyes

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
did was single arm incline cable flyes
I've<00:01:35.549> come<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.900> exercise

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I've come to really like this exercise

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
I've come to really like this exercise
as<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> recent<00:01:38.040> mostly<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.000> feel<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
as a recent mostly because I feel it so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
as a recent mostly because I feel it so
much<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.320> upper<00:01:40.619> chest<00:01:40.829> compared<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
much more in my upper chest compared to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
much more in my upper chest compared to
other<00:01:41.520> isolation<00:01:42.180> exercises<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.960> I've<00:01:43.079> done

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
other isolation exercises that I've done

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219 
other isolation exercises that I've done
in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> past<00:01:43.759> with<00:01:44.759> exercises<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.630> these<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
in the past with exercises like these I

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
in the past with exercises like these I
tend<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> focus<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.100> lot<00:01:47.310> less<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.790> actual

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
tend to focus a lot less on the actual

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
tend to focus a lot less on the actual
weight<00:01:48.509> i'm<00:01:48.689> using<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> focusing

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
weight i'm using and more on focusing

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
weight i'm using and more on focusing
every<00:01:50.939> ounce<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> tension<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
every ounce of the tension into the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
every ounce of the tension into the
muscle<00:01:52.470> being<00:01:52.649> worked<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.060> easy<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
muscle being worked it's really easy to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
muscle being worked it's really easy to
lose<00:01:54.720> focus<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> start<00:01:55.649> incorporating<00:01:55.979> other

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
lose focus and start incorporating other

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
lose focus and start incorporating other
muscles<00:01:57.030> into<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.420> movement<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> you're

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
muscles into a movement that you're

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.959 
muscles into a movement that you're
supposed<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.590> exclusively<00:01:59.310> using<00:01:59.610> one

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
supposed to be exclusively using one

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.480 
supposed to be exclusively using one
certain<00:02:00.390> muscle<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> execute<00:02:01.369> obviously<00:02:02.369> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
certain muscle to execute obviously this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.069 
certain muscle to execute obviously this
should<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.790> without<00:02:02.909> saying<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:04.049> sure

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
should go without saying but make sure

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.990 
should go without saying but make sure
to<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> same<00:02:04.860> amount<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.310> reps<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> wait

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to do the same amount of reps and wait

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
to do the same amount of reps and wait
for<00:02:06.210> both<00:02:06.420> sides<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:06.960> body<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.500> recommend

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
for both sides of your body I recommend

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
for both sides of your body I recommend
working<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.849> weaker<00:02:09.179> side<00:02:09.390> first<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.020> then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
working your weaker side first and then

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
working your weaker side first and then
matching<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> reps<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.550> wait<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.000> on

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
matching the reps and wait you do on

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910 
matching the reps and wait you do on
your<00:02:12.150> weak<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:13.020> your<00:02:13.170> strong<00:02:13.470> side

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
your weak side with your strong side

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
your weak side with your strong side
this<00:02:14.370> will<00:02:14.550> eventually<00:02:15.000> lead<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.209> evenness

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this will eventually lead to evenness

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.230 
this will eventually lead to evenness
between<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> two

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.910 

the<00:02:20.240> second<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.660> last<00:02:20.840> exercise<00:02:21.320> i<00:02:21.530> did<00:02:21.710> was

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
the second of last exercise i did was

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800 
the second of last exercise i did was
dips<00:02:22.250> which<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> personal<00:02:23.360> favorite<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
dips which is a personal favorite of

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.690 
dips which is a personal favorite of
mine<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.200> lower<00:02:24.380> chest<00:02:24.710> if<00:02:25.010> done<00:02:25.460> incorrectly

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
mine for lower chest if done incorrectly

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.570 
mine for lower chest if done incorrectly
this<00:02:26.510> exercise<00:02:26.870> will<00:02:27.200> absolutely<00:02:27.830> annihilate

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
this exercise will absolutely annihilate

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.190 
this exercise will absolutely annihilate
your<00:02:28.730> shoulders<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.960> good<00:02:29.990> way

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
your shoulders and not in a good way

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.770 
your shoulders and not in a good way
what<00:02:31.190> I've<00:02:31.310> learned<00:02:31.580> over<00:02:31.730> time<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.360> not<00:02:32.570> go

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
what I've learned over time is to not go

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.690 
what I've learned over time is to not go
too<00:02:32.840> low<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> bottom<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.100> movement<00:02:34.550> I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
too low at the bottom of the movement I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.820 
too low at the bottom of the movement I
do<00:02:35.120> realize<00:02:35.600> some<00:02:36.020> people<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.440> dip<00:02:36.650> down

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
do realize some people can dip down

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.250 
do realize some people can dip down
lower<00:02:37.160> than<00:02:37.430> others<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.300> even<00:02:38.630> being<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:39.020> full

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
lower than others but even being a full

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650 
lower than others but even being a full
range<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.650> motion<00:02:39.710> advocate<00:02:40.520> myself<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.210> think

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
range of motion advocate myself I think

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.210 
range of motion advocate myself I think
that<00:02:41.990> when<00:02:42.140> doing<00:02:42.470> these<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.920> should<00:02:43.070> use

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
that when doing these you should use

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.250 
that when doing these you should use
extreme<00:02:43.610> caution<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.540> safe<00:02:44.840> rather<00:02:45.050> than

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
extreme caution and be safe rather than

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320 
extreme caution and be safe rather than
sorry<00:02:45.680> even<00:02:46.370> if<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.610> does<00:02:46.820> mean<00:02:47.030> sacrificing

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
sorry even if that does mean sacrificing

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.420 
sorry even if that does mean sacrificing
your<00:02:47.870> range<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.230> motion<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.100> but

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
your range of motion a little bit but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.040 
your range of motion a little bit but

really really lightweight I was talking

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.340 
really really lightweight I was talking
about<00:03:04.700> isolating<00:03:05.300> my<00:03:05.570> chest<00:03:05.870> with<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> local

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
about isolating my chest with a local

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.290 
about isolating my chest with a local
bodybuilder<00:03:07.040> who<00:03:07.220> i<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.400> has<00:03:07.670> an<00:03:07.880> awesomely

developed chest and one thing he told me

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.430 
developed chest and one thing he told me
is<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:11.120> years<00:03:11.300> he's<00:03:11.600> always<00:03:11.960> ended<00:03:12.290> his
