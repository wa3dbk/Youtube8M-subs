00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.580
 video that I bring you good today 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.519
 being my birthday and the whole thing 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.999
 it turned 24 years that I'm making a 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.480
 little old so good if you give me a 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:22.990
 small luxury as well they gave me here 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.119
 this this mouse that you see here that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.949
 months is a flavor rap 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.810
 that's how a taste is so weird 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.060
 I show some better hands in the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.619
 industry in the first set we estimate what 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.770
 I wanted for a long time like 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.820
 can see is quite sexy mind the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.480
 first name rats this rat and taste 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.130
 okay 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.630
 what do we have different of all 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.840
 the other people I show them 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.690
 and you can see it is extremely 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 big which helps my hands 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.510
 giants then we take the part that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.190
 it is adjustable what can be smaller 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.840
 longer more curved so that for you 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.009
 when you are more comfortable playing which 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 obviously it's pretty sexy like 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.390
 can see here on this side come that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 bring parts that you can put on 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.799
 you can remove this you can adjust it 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.549
 here when with a small key that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.860
 brings special height or inclination 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.250
 of the buttons etcetera etcetera this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.979
 then as you can see, they gave it to me 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 there is that person because he already knows 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.890
 who is then let's go to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.240
 open it because the truth is that it no longer 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 you know how old I am to open this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.740
 thing you're going to do I do not know how many 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 years so let me see if I can do 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.619
 a boxing with one hand is quite 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.619
 hardcore I'll tell you the time 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.010
 the fears to see 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.820
 do not 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.820
 we give 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.280
 there it is very good but now open the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.280
 point is how 10 blues 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.479
 Let's see if I'll pair it out there 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.170
 does not need in the way of opening it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.170
 so 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.900
 because I'm going to make a cut here and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.620
 gamers and I'm going to pray have an open 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.390
 second 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 well here they have it let me just 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.690
 get it out now yes because the way in the 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.100
 which can get it out without having to go 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.100
 break the boxes 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.940
 to make a little bit more complicated of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.100
 what I thought is very good with the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.730
 mouse and obviously down the magicians 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.840
 as always there is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.840
 have with his 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 all the packages all their drivers 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.099
 I imagine it comes with drivers I do not know 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.160
 if he does not come against and see if he told me 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.930
 which is plug and play and if no more part 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.790
 that has keys to configure as 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.180
 if it were a macro which is very 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.170
 tried because I show up here here 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.630
 we have the taste the flavor box 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.590
 it comes very well packaged 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.590
 let's see what this has to do 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.230
 I open it and how can you see 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.670
 and the different parts of the mouse the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.020
 which can be customized then if 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.090
 well in the back is the part of 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.010
 behind the mouse 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.370
 also so that this one has a bit of 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.370
 camera 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.520
 this here is the back of the hands 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.530
 this is the part of I think next door 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
 also from behind but so you have a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.690
 little more air grip the parts of the 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.600
 side or those who are what this is 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.680
 the part of here of the to click 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.680
 and this is the key appointment with which 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 adjust 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.560
 crystal adjust what are the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.680
 different parts I tell them as one of 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.500
 the best and sexiest hands of the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.479
 market at this time of investment is 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.919
 100% recommended although what I 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.440
 I want to do is grab the equipment and 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.729
 put the computer because hell and 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.370
 I want to play with this thing to be 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.669
 incredible but good 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.030
 there the gamers have the mouse 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.669
 rat from the board forgiveness because if a 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.940
 little sick and throat I say that 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.070
 you can hear it 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.260
 lends an English yon box pin that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.960
 I brought today to be and compensated and 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.110
 the whole thing then already and again in 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.060
 four years but for the time gamers 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.980
 You already know that my name is bad and we 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.980
 we see until the next
