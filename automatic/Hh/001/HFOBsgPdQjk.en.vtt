the<00:02:09.649> dippy<00:02:09.860> part<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.159> it<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.090> know<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.269> do<00:02:11.360> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
the dippy part of it and you know I do a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.119

always stands from tattooing you know

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.580 
always stands from tattooing you know
it's<00:02:16.519> just<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.989> an<00:02:18.409> actual

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
it's just it's it's an actual

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.550

because<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.280> know<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.849> can't<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.569> you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
because you know you can't do one you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.000 
because you know you can't do one you
can<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.380> without<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> other

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
can do one without the other

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.010 
can do one without the other
I<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.430> must<00:02:23.580> paint<00:02:23.940> or<00:02:24.120> draw<00:02:24.300> because

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
I think you must paint or draw because

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.470 
I think you must paint or draw because

it helps your tattling more if you can

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.530 
it helps your tattling more if you can
