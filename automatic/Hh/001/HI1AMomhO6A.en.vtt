MICHELLE OBAMA: You may know
some kids who have a parent in

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.640
the military.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.985
ELMO: Yeah, it can be hard when
a daddy and a mommy is

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:07.170
away for a long time.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.050
ROSITA: Well, you can help
them feel better.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.755
DR. JILL BIDEN: By including
them in what you do.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:11.490
Playing with them.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.600
MICHELLE OBAMA: And just
letting them know

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.510
they've got a friend.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.760
ELMO: Yeah.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.730
MAN 1: When I was putting the
flight suit on, Jackson kept

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.320
asking me, where you
going, daddy?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.981
Where you going?

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.699
ELMO: Daddy's gotta go
away for lots and

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.620
lots of days, right?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.900
LOUIE: That's right, son.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.970
GIRL 1: Sometimes, I would sit
in my room and cry into my

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.630
pillow and say, why
me, why me?

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.520
MAN 2: This particular fight
you can't do alone.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.390
You need that family support,
you need that team.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.400
PATTY SHINSEKI: Talk, Listen,
Connect is a Sesame Workshop

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.070
Project that was developed for
military children who are

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.930
experiencing some challenges due
to changes and transitions

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180
in their lives.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.520
Bilingual resources were created
to help children and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.930
families deal with three
difficult issues.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.905
The first, when a parent
is deployed.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:07.770
LOUIE: Hey, listen, son.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.754
Do you know what today is?

00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:11.200
ELMO: Thursday.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.110
LOUIE: Well, yes.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.600
Yes, it is Thursday.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.070
But it's also that day
we talked about.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.590
Remember, the day
I have to go?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.090
ELMO: Oh, yeah.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.940
BOY 1: When my daddy has to go
run somewhere, he will ask me

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.590
to watch him so I can
be like a leader

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.516
for my little brother.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.470
I love you, daddy.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.460
PATTY SHINSEKI: The second
focused on changes, when a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.280
parent returns changed either
through injury or some

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.350
emotional challenges.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.656
ROSITA: [CRYING]

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:47.640
I wish your legs
were OK, papi.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.792
And I wish you didn't have to
go to the doctor so much.

00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:59.888
And I just wish things could go
back to the way they were.

00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:03.428
GIRL 2: He doesn't have
no legs and one arm.

00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:05.400
MAN 3: At first, I didn't think
she wanted to hug me

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.610
because she was scared
of me maybe.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.200
That hug made me feel so happy
and complete inside that it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.830
made me feel like I didn't
lose anything at all.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.310
PATTY SHINSEKI: And the third
was when family grieve,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.200
helping children through the
process of grieving.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.510
BOY 2: Dear Dad, I miss
you very much.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.090
If you were here, you would
meet my little brother.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.950
BOY 3: I didn't get
to meet my daddy.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.350
LOUIE: Sometimes, it's hard to
talk about someone who died

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.940
because brings up all
those big feelings.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.940
KATIE COURIC: So, Jesse, even
though you didn't want to talk

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
about your dad at first, you
felt much better once you did?

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.760
JESSE: Yeah.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.920
Talking to my uncle Louie made
me realize, well, that I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.275
wasn't alone with my feelings.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.053
ELMO: Yeah, because
we all miss him.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.890
PATTY SHINSEKI: The military
has a lot of programs

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.470
available but not
to this extent.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.860
This absolutely zeroed in on
those challenges that military

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.790
children experience.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.100
Other components of the program
are a safe website

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.290
where families can stay
connected, Sesame themed play

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.190
spaces at military bases and
hospitals, And a partnership

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.420
with the USO that sent the
Muppets around the world to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.640
perform for military children.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.850
WOMAN 1: I'm just glad someone
has something like this,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.700
something nice that my children
could experience.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.570
That was something positive.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.940
WOMAN 2: I think it's really
great that they're taking the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.400
time to do something
like this.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560
PATTY SHINSEKI: Talk, Listen,
Connect offers that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.830
opportunity to begin
conversations, to communicate,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.300
to keep in touch.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.910
We want to help children
thrive during these

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.160
challenging times.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.310
CAPTAIN PAUL S. HAMMER: The most
important thing for the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.490
military member is to know that
their family is taken

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.930
care of when they're far away.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.016

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:04.647
CAPTAIN PAUL S. HAMMER: What
Sesame Workshop has been able

00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:09.040
to provide is a whole group of
tools that really help kids

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.140
and families have something in
their tool box that they can

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.840
really use when the stress
of deployment occurs.
