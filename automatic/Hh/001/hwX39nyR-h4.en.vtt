talk about and again these are
controlled<00:00:29.239> tile<00:00:29.630> positions<00:00:30.230> is<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.189> basic

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
controlled tile positions is a basic

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.120 
controlled tile positions is a basic
inside<00:00:32.239> control<00:00:32.689> time<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:33.710> what<00:00:33.950> we're

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
inside control time and what we're

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.430
