00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's not even a bad idea sometimes let's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's not even a bad idea sometimes let's
just<00:02:01.020> sit<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.470> minute<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.979> give<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:02.490> few
