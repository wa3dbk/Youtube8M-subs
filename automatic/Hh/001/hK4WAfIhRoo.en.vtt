and sometimes because we have chocolate
less<00:04:47.780> regularly<00:04:48.230> so<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.530> satisfies<00:04:49.160> all<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
less regularly so that satisfies all the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.090 
less regularly so that satisfies all the
caterers<00:04:49.639> for<00:04:50.090> sweetness<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.630> chocolate<00:04:51.100> and
