00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
megapixels that this device actually

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
megapixels that this device actually
comes<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.289> whereas<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.309> cyanogenmod<00:00:47.879> only

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
comes with whereas the cyanogenmod only

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
comes with whereas the cyanogenmod only
allowed<00:00:48.510> us<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> 2<00:00:49.410> megapixels<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
allowed us to go up to 2 megapixels so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
allowed us to go up to 2 megapixels so
that's<00:00:51.539> nice<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.170> great<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> lot

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that's nice and great and use for a lot

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.000 
that's nice and great and use for a lot
of<00:00:53.280> us<00:00:53.399> which<00:00:53.550> means<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:53.940> might<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.149> other

nightly<00:01:44.220> builds<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.630> said<00:01:45.930> we're

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
nightly builds so with that said we're

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
nightly builds so with that said we're
going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.649> ahead<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> back<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> like

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
going to go ahead and back out and like

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
going to go ahead and back out and like
the<00:01:48.180> last<00:01:48.210> ones<00:01:48.630> i've<00:01:48.780> downloaded<00:01:48.960> quadrant

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the last ones i've downloaded quadrant

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.980 
the last ones i've downloaded quadrant
and<00:01:50.040> antutu<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.390> we're<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.840> ahead

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and antutu so we're going to go ahead

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.010 
and antutu so we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:52.079> run<00:01:52.500> our<00:01:52.640> quadrant<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> we're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and run our quadrant and we're going to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.209 
and run our quadrant and we're going to
see<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.409> AOKP<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:57.090> give<00:01:57.270> us<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.829> we'll<00:01:59.159> go

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
see what AOKP can give us and we'll go

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.100 
see what AOKP can give us and we'll go
ahead<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.549> speed<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.509> footage<00:02:00.780> will<00:02:01.020> be

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
ahead and speed up the footage will be

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.510 
ahead and speed up the footage will be
back<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.979> moment

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.400 

you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.220 

alrighty<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.400> our<00:02:14.850> quadrant<00:02:15.630> benchmark<00:02:16.110> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
alrighty and our quadrant benchmark is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.960 
alrighty and our quadrant benchmark is
finished<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.740> course<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.790> last

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
finished and of course like the last

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090 
finished and of course like the last
video<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.810> hasn't<00:02:19.140> exactly<00:02:19.200> been<00:02:19.530> optimized

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
video it hasn't exactly been optimized

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.020 
video it hasn't exactly been optimized
yet<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.760> I'll<00:02:21.150> read<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.480> off<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:23.030> 6790

the benchmark is completed and we've got

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.470 
the benchmark is completed and we've got
a<00:03:26.100> final<00:03:26.850> score<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.120> 20<00:03:28.520> 2748<00:03:29.520> go<00:03:30.180> ahead<00:03:30.360> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
scroll down submit that to see what's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.470 
scroll down submit that to see what's
the<00:03:32.310> next<00:03:32.459> down<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.819> list<00:03:33.000> which<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.240> going

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the next down the list which I'm going

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.620 
the next down the list which I'm going
to<00:03:33.569> assume<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.590> galaxy<00:03:35.130> s4<00:03:35.490> i9500<00:03:36.300> does

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
to assume is the galaxy s4 i9500 does

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.510 
to assume is the galaxy s4 i9500 does
it's<00:03:36.810> showing<00:03:37.110> right<00:03:37.319> there<00:03:37.560> with<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> score

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
it's showing right there with the score

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.300 
it's showing right there with the score
of<00:03:38.610> 30,000<00:03:39.350> 675<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.880> with<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.480> said<00:03:42.980> yeah<00:03:43.980> you

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
of 30,000 675 so with that said yeah you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.890 
of 30,000 675 so with that said yeah you
know<00:03:44.430> don't<00:03:44.670> don't<00:03:44.940> again<00:03:45.239> take<00:03:45.540> all<00:03:45.750> these

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
know don't don't again take all these

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720 
know don't don't again take all these
benchmarks<00:03:46.770> with<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> grain<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.220> salt<00:03:47.340> these

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
benchmarks with a grain of salt these

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.590 
benchmarks with a grain of salt these
are<00:03:47.850> brand-new<00:03:48.920> Knightley's<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:51.480> know

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
are brand-new Knightley's and you know

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.780 
are brand-new Knightley's and you know
that<00:03:51.840> shouldn't<00:03:52.319> let<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.709> dictate<00:03:53.069> or<00:03:53.430> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
that shouldn't let you dictate or it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.850 
that shouldn't let you dictate or it
doesn't<00:03:54.209> dictate<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.989> performance<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.680> these

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
doesn't dictate the performance of these

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.120 
doesn't dictate the performance of these
roms<00:03:56.220> or<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.550> device<00:03:56.760> itself<00:03:56.970> obviously

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
roms or the device itself obviously

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.070 
roms or the device itself obviously
anyways<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.519> hopefully<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.390> was<00:04:00.690> fun<00:04:00.930> for

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
anyways so hopefully that was fun for

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080 
anyways so hopefully that was fun for
you<00:04:01.170> guys<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.440> watch<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.250> was<00:04:02.430> don't<00:04:02.880> forget
