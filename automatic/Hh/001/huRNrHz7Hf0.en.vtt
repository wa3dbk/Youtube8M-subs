that<00:02:21.010> happens<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.730> quite<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> few<00:02:22.240> tunes<00:02:22.600> where

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that happens in quite a few tunes where

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.090 
that happens in quite a few tunes where
you<00:02:23.020> go<00:02:24.630> where<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.720> might<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:26.170> there<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.650> way

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
you go where you might get there a way

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.360 
you go where you might get there a way
to<00:02:27.130> get<00:02:27.520> there<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.750> some<00:02:28.930> nice<00:02:29.170> movement<00:02:29.560> is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to get there with some nice movement is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.960 
to get there with some nice movement is
this<00:02:31.260> voicing<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.830> book<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.370> this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
this voicing that's in the book to this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.900 
this voicing that's in the book to this
a<00:02:34.150> flat<00:02:34.900> dominant<00:02:35.320> it's<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.040> passing<00:02:36.550> chord

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
a flat dominant it's a passing chord

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.060 
a flat dominant it's a passing chord
which<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.320> tritone<00:02:39.070> substitution<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.800> g

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
which is a tritone substitution to the g

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:51.660 
which is a tritone substitution to the g
major<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.000> sounds<00:02:43.210> like<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:51.250> i<00:02:51.400> play<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
major so that sounds like if i play it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:02.820 
major so that sounds like if i play it
