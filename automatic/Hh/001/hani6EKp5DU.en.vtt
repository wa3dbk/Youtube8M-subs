so I figured that I would show you guys
our<00:00:12.799> apartment<00:00:13.799> because<00:00:14.340> we've<00:00:14.639> been<00:00:14.940> moving

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
our apartment because we've been moving

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.790 
our apartment because we've been moving
in<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.540> guess<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> past<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.320> weeks<00:00:16.560> now

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in I guess for the past two weeks now

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.939 
in I guess for the past two weeks now
and<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.400> still<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:17.820> messy<00:00:18.410> but<00:00:19.410> we're
