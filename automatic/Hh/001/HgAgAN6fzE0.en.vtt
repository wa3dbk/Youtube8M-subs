00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
black made things stand out a little bit

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.649 
black made things stand out a little bit
better<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.909> think<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> Jeep<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.509> lot

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
better I think the Jeep looks a lot

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
better I think the Jeep looks a lot
better<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:25.700> because<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> used<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
better that way because it used to be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.580 
better that way because it used to be
the<00:01:27.240> regular<00:01:27.540> old<00:01:28.549> gray<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> wasn't<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the regular old gray and it wasn't I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.450 
the regular old gray and it wasn't I
don't<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> wasn't<00:01:32.159> doing<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> for

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
don't know it just wasn't doing it for

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.440 
don't know it just wasn't doing it for
me<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:34.310> black<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.520> black<00:01:35.909> did<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> really

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
me so black I think black did it really

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
me so black I think black did it really
get<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.170> said<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.439> still<00:01:40.710> need<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get on it like I said I still need to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.240
