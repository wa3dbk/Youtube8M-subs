00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
video I did film this video yesterday

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.670 
video I did film this video yesterday
but<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.660> didn't<00:00:09.870> go<00:00:09.960> too<00:00:10.020> well<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.500> lighting

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
but it didn't go too well the lighting

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.200 
but it didn't go too well the lighting
was<00:00:10.950> horrendous<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.459> I<00:00:11.550> did<00:00:11.700> actually<00:00:11.940> upload

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
was horrendous and I did actually upload

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.060 
was horrendous and I did actually upload
it<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.389> morning<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.230> took<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.860> down

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
it this morning but I took it down

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.770 
it this morning but I took it down
because<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.790> just<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.210> looked<00:00:15.480> rubbish

I'm just getting the update so basically

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.890 
I'm just getting the update so basically
the<00:00:59.190> reason<00:00:59.340> why<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.150> first<00:01:00.480> made<00:01:00.780> my

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
the reason why when I first made my

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.860 
the reason why when I first made my
channel<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> uploaded<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.850> two<00:01:03.270> videos<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
channel and I uploaded like two videos I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.020 
channel and I uploaded like two videos I
think<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.649> I<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.860> absent<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.759> three

think then I was absent for like three

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
think then I was absent for like three
months<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.960> extremely

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
months is because I was just extremely

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.490 
months is because I was just extremely
busy<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.490> many<00:01:08.909> different<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:09.540> first
