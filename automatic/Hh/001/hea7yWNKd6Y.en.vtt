00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.500 
PPA is a great alternative tactic to use

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.639 
PPA is a great alternative tactic to use
on<00:00:03.889> both<00:00:04.130> rivers<00:00:04.490> and<00:00:04.700> commercial<00:00:05.210> waters<00:00:05.649> PVA

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
on both rivers and commercial waters PVA

is<00:00:06.919> actually<00:00:07.250> a<00:00:07.310> mesh<00:00:07.580> that<00:00:07.609> dissolves<00:00:08.420> once

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
is actually a mesh that dissolves once

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.600 
is actually a mesh that dissolves once
it's<00:00:08.929> immersed<00:00:09.230> in<00:00:09.410> water<00:00:09.530> which<00:00:10.160> makes<00:00:10.370> it

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
it's immersed in water which makes it

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.310 
it's immersed in water which makes it
perfect<00:00:10.880> for<00:00:11.240> presenting<00:00:11.750> baits<00:00:12.019> that<00:00:12.200> you

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
perfect for presenting baits that you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.169 
perfect for presenting baits that you
can't<00:00:12.620> do<00:00:12.889> with<00:00:13.099> other<00:00:13.339> methods<00:00:13.759> I've<00:00:13.969> gone

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
can't do with other methods I've gone

for<00:00:14.330> oil<00:00:14.809> baits<00:00:14.990> today<00:00:15.259> basically<00:00:15.740> we've<00:00:15.830> got

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
for oil baits today basically we've got

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.530 
for oil baits today basically we've got
bright<00:00:16.250> sunshine<00:00:16.760> it's<00:00:17.120> the<00:00:17.240> middle<00:00:17.480> of

bright sunshine it's the middle of
summer<00:00:17.600> I've<00:00:18.140> got<00:00:18.380> four<00:00:19.010> meals<00:00:19.190> Supermarine

halibuts<00:00:20.270> these<00:00:20.750> happen<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:21.080> be<00:00:21.170> one<00:00:21.410> of<00:00:21.500> my

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
halibuts these happen to be one of my

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.620 
halibuts these happen to be one of my
favorite<00:00:22.100> pellets<00:00:22.520> they're<00:00:22.910> quite<00:00:23.300> red<00:00:23.540> in

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
favorite pellets they're quite red in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.900 
favorite pellets they're quite red in
color<00:00:23.870> very<00:00:24.320> high<00:00:24.560> in<00:00:24.740> oil<00:00:24.830> very<00:00:25.370> attractive

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
color very high in oil very attractive

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.270 
color very high in oil very attractive
and<00:00:26.630> actually<00:00:26.960> mix<00:00:27.170> those<00:00:27.380> with<00:00:27.740> a<00:00:27.770> six<00:00:28.070> mil

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
and actually mix those with a six mil

halibut<00:00:29.030> marine<00:00:29.270> pellet<00:00:29.600> these<00:00:29.810> are<00:00:29.960> much

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
halibut marine pellet these are much

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.370 
halibut marine pellet these are much
darker<00:00:30.380> but<00:00:31.100> also<00:00:31.280> very<00:00:31.670> very<00:00:31.910> high<00:00:32.090> in<00:00:32.239> oil

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.720 
darker but also very very high in oil
the<00:00:33.380> reason<00:00:33.680> I<00:00:33.740> mix<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.010> two<00:00:34.040> baits<00:00:34.370> together

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
the reason I mix the two baits together

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.670 
the reason I mix the two baits together
is<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.120> give<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> varied<00:00:35.690> breakdown<00:00:36.170> what's<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
is to give a varied breakdown what's the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.920 
is to give a varied breakdown what's the
base<00:00:36.860> on<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.280> lakebed<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.450> means<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:38.840> I've

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
base on the lakebed this means that I've

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.780 
base on the lakebed this means that I've
always<00:00:39.260> got<00:00:39.440> some<00:00:39.620> bait<00:00:39.800> working<00:00:40.280> for<00:00:40.490> me<00:00:40.640> in

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
always got some bait working for me in

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.910 
always got some bait working for me in
the<00:00:40.970> swim<00:00:41.180> as<00:00:42.170> far<00:00:42.320> as<00:00:42.470> hook<00:00:42.590> bait<00:00:42.770> is

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the swim as far as hook bait is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.980 
the swim as far as hook bait is
concerned<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:43.820> really<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.630> world<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:44.930> your

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
concerned it's really the world is your

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.780 
concerned it's really the world is your
oyster<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.530> can<00:00:45.680> choose<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.250> use<00:00:46.460> whatever

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
oyster you can choose and use whatever

you want
my<00:00:47.990> particular<00:00:48.290> preference<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.160> boilies

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
my particular preference is for boilies

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.319 
my particular preference is for boilies
an<00:00:50.030> 8<00:00:50.810> mil<00:00:51.050> premium<00:00:51.800> hard<00:00:52.340> pellets<00:00:52.820> they're

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
an 8 mil premium hard pellets they're

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.690 
an 8 mil premium hard pellets they're
really<00:00:53.720> really<00:00:53.870> good<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.560> they<00:00:54.800> contrast<00:00:55.310> to

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
really really good and they contrast to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
really really good and they contrast to
the<00:00:55.790> feed<00:00:56.000> baits<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:56.390> you're<00:00:56.600> actually

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
the feed baits that you're actually

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720 
the feed baits that you're actually
using<00:00:56.930> attaching<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:57.829> baits<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.280> really

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
using attaching the baits is really

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.729 
using attaching the baits is really
simple<00:00:59.120> I'll<00:00:59.300> either<00:00:59.510> use<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.930> band<00:01:00.200> for<00:01:00.560> hard

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
simple I'll either use a band for hard

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.500 
simple I'll either use a band for hard
pellets<00:01:01.070> or<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.280> standard<00:01:01.940> hair<00:01:02.149> rig<00:01:02.300> for

this<00:01:15.080> allows<00:01:15.350> me<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.620> change<00:01:15.799> them<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.370> hook

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
this allows me to change them the hook

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.370 
this allows me to change them the hook
length<00:01:16.760> really<00:01:17.240> really<00:01:17.450> quickly<00:01:17.659> I<00:01:17.930> can<00:01:18.290> have

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
length really really quickly I can have

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.719 
length really really quickly I can have
two<00:01:18.530> three<00:01:18.680> or<00:01:18.770> four<00:01:18.920> hook<00:01:19.070> length<00:01:19.280> set<00:01:19.549> up

two three or four hook length set up
ready<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.090> go

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
ready to go

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.210 
ready to go
this<00:01:20.750> improves<00:01:21.110> my<00:01:21.260> efficiency<00:01:21.650> meaning<00:01:22.159> I

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
this improves my efficiency meaning I

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.770 
this improves my efficiency meaning I
catch<00:01:22.430> more<00:01:22.700> through<00:01:22.970> those<00:01:23.120> feeding<00:01:23.479> spells

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
catch more through those feeding spells

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.050 
catch more through those feeding spells
making<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.799> bag<00:01:24.950> itself<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:25.880> really

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
making the bag itself is really really

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.270 
making the bag itself is really really
simple<00:01:26.330> I'll<00:01:27.110> use<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.470> plunger<00:01:27.710> when<00:01:28.190> I'm

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
simple I'll use the plunger when I'm

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.399 
simple I'll use the plunger when I'm
using<00:01:28.430> groundbait<00:01:29.000> but<00:01:29.479> like<00:01:29.659> today<00:01:29.810> when<00:01:30.320> I'm

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
using groundbait but like today when I'm

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.080 
using groundbait but like today when I'm
only<00:01:30.560> using<00:01:30.890> half<00:01:31.040> pellets<00:01:31.430> there's<00:01:31.700> no<00:01:31.850> need

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
only using half pellets there's no need

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.680 
only using half pellets there's no need
I<00:01:32.409> actually<00:01:33.409> do<00:01:33.740> also<00:01:33.860> use<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.430> bait<00:01:34.700> measure<00:01:34.970> so

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
I actually do also use a bait measure so

the<00:02:51.470> simplest<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.519> just<00:02:52.790> hook<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.030> on<00:02:53.300> it's

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the simplest is to just hook it on it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.060 
the simplest is to just hook it on it's
really<00:02:53.870> important<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> remember<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.830> your

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
really important to remember that your

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.710 
really important to remember that your
hook<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.459> far<00:02:55.760> away<00:02:56.000> from<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.269> knots<00:02:56.480> as

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
hook is far away from the knots as

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.830 
hook is far away from the knots as
possible<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.440> pass<00:02:58.100> my<00:02:58.280> hook<00:02:58.519> through<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.630> top

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
possible I pass my hook through the top

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.990 
possible I pass my hook through the top
spin<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.010> bag<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.760> hook<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.019> second<00:03:03.380> time

that<00:03:05.000> just<00:03:05.120> means<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.780> really

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that just means it's really really
