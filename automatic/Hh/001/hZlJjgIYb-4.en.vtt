him back them in I think they're trying
to<00:04:38.050> keep<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.160> sheep<00:04:39.370> stop<00:04:39.610> following

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
to keep it so the sheep stop following

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.370 
to keep it so the sheep stop following
him<00:04:40.120> or<00:04:40.210> something<00:04:40.480> now<00:04:41.040> yeah<00:04:42.510> yeah<00:04:43.510> I<00:04:43.810> know<00:04:44.350> I
