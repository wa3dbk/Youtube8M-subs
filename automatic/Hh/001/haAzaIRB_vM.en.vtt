go for it I just don't have that one
right<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> really<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.759> just

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
right now but I really want it just

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.510 
right now but I really want it just
because<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.750> hairstyle<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.320> lot<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
because I do this hairstyle a lot and it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
because I do this hairstyle a lot and it
would<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.670> easier<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> use<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:09.989> milks

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
would be easier to use one with milks

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.890 
would be easier to use one with milks
there

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:41.270 

so<00:02:16.900> again<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.560> holding<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.100> behind<00:02:18.580> my<00:02:18.790> head

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.559 

so<00:02:42.280> now<00:02:42.610> I'm<00:02:42.760> back<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.540> side<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.280> um<00:02:45.569> same

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
so now I'm back on this side and um same

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.920 
so now I'm back on this side and um same
thing<00:02:47.099> holding<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.489> iron<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:49.120> my<00:02:49.450> opposite

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
thing holding the iron with my opposite

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.040 
thing holding the iron with my opposite
hand<00:02:49.989> can't<00:02:50.950> take<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.280> earring<00:02:51.670> out

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
hand can't take this earring out

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.030 
hand can't take this earring out
probably<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.380> get<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.590> there<00:02:53.770> so<00:02:53.920> I'm

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
probably going to get in there so I'm

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.650 
probably going to get in there so I'm
taking<00:02:54.160> with<00:02:54.400> my<00:02:54.520> left<00:02:54.760> hand<00:02:54.849> because<00:02:55.300> it's<00:02:55.480> my

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
taking with my left hand because it's my

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.040 
taking with my left hand because it's my
right<00:02:55.870> side<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.910> take<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.569> section

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
right side we just take that section

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.309 
right side we just take that section
again<00:02:59.349> I<00:03:00.510> usually<00:03:01.510> do<00:03:01.660> better<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:01.959> my<00:03:02.140> right

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
again I usually do better on my right

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.949 
again I usually do better on my right
side<00:03:02.349> for<00:03:02.769> some<00:03:02.920> reason<00:03:04.410> don't<00:03:05.410> know<00:03:05.680> why

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
side for some reason don't know why

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.670 
side for some reason don't know why
maybe<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.200> because<00:03:08.290> I'm<00:03:08.470> right-handed

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
maybe it's because I'm right-handed

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:43.309 
maybe it's because I'm right-handed
that's<00:03:09.370> probably<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.339
