00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it's a random number generator which you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's a random number generator which you
can<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.630> generate<00:00:21.840> random<00:00:22.260> numbers<00:00:22.470> for

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
can use to generate random numbers for

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
can use to generate random numbers for
whatever<00:00:23.189> purpose<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.390> online
