this<00:02:02.030> smoother<00:02:02.750> pavement<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> shortened

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
this smoother pavement so I shortened

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.690 
this smoother pavement so I shortened
and<00:02:04.520> quickened<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.000> stride<00:02:05.830> yes<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:07.369> is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and quickened my stride yes this is

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.719 
and quickened my stride yes this is
becoming<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.540> familiar<00:02:08.979> contradiction<00:02:09.979> I've

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
becoming a familiar contradiction I've

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.150 
becoming a familiar contradiction I've
recently<00:02:11.120> told<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.989> must<00:02:12.260> stay<00:02:12.920> low

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
recently told you that you must stay low

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.000 
recently told you that you must stay low
stay<00:02:13.580> low<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.420> fully<00:02:14.780> extend<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:15.290> stride

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
stay low and fully extend your stride

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.370 
stay low and fully extend your stride
I<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.940> also<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.420> numerous<00:02:17.750> occasions

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
I have also on numerous occasions

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710 
I have also on numerous occasions
regarding<00:02:19.010> slippery<00:02:19.489> surfaces<00:02:20.000> told<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.510> to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
regarding slippery surfaces told you to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.500 
regarding slippery surfaces told you to
shorten<00:02:21.620> your<00:02:21.770> stride<00:02:22.000> by<00:02:23.000> deconstructing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
shorten your stride by deconstructing

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.660 
shorten your stride by deconstructing
the<00:02:24.050> elements<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.680> city<00:02:24.920> skate<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.459> year

the elements of a city skate this year

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.070 
the elements of a city skate this year
I've<00:02:25.790> come<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.150> realize<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
I've come to realize that the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.260 
I've come to realize that the
opportunity<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.980> employ<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.580> full<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
opportunity to employ a full and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.250 
opportunity to employ a full and
complete<00:02:29.450> stride<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.470> rare<00:02:31.280> indeed<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:33.110> can

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
complete stride is rare indeed you can

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.430 
complete stride is rare indeed you can
still<00:02:33.500> stay<00:02:33.739> low<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> make<00:02:34.459> sure<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:34.820> right

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
still stay low and make sure it's right

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:45.089 
still stay low and make sure it's right
it's<00:02:36.440> tiring<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.100> deal

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.009

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
skating on shite wheels is exhausting

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.239 
skating on shite wheels is exhausting
but<00:02:48.799> not<00:02:48.950> very<00:02:49.159> dangerous<00:02:50.049> if<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.349> big<00:02:51.680> chunk<00:02:52.069> of
