00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.870
 today we are going to experiment with the food they deceive us with the food that we 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.660
 Do you sell 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.330
 we are going to need 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.930
 fluorine is a painting based on it although at home you can use betadine 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.610
 which is used to disinfect wounds although the result will not be so 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.689
 spectacular 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 your favorite mutilated we have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.489
 York ham 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.849
 Serrano ham and Italian mortadella plus iron-enriched cereals 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.529
 very important nil 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.380
 I think it is tiny is very powerful unprecedented crimes fixed the goal 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.360
 what I have 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.490
 in this boat 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.760
 It is a disinfectant for tempera but also very characteristic features 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.330
 important and that is that when we put 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.650
 with the dirty starch so dirty 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.620
 you see how it changes to a black color it's a bluish black instead of the brown that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.060
 we have here 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.230
 none of these sausages would have to test positive for referees let's see 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.250
 what happens when we sign up high 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.330
 efe 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.310
 it seems like it has starch 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.360
 the taste is sweet 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.159
 it seems that they also have a sure color months ham serrano 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.060
 Serrano ham for the moment is saved 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 and jb thaliana 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 it's a scandal these bandits 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.850
 well he thought he was eating only meat, not what happens is that for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.040
 cheapen many of these sausages they add 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.030
 although it is an occar data of the potato 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.140
 very caloric and very cheap 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.270
 and now we're going for the cereals 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.590
 let's take a little bit of these cereals 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 supposedly enriched burial 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.900
 and now what we are going to do 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 espigares penal 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.650
 let's play here 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.030
 little let's see what we've got 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.450
 and it seems 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.190
 It is true 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.940
 fixed 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.620
 as only on the two poles to this on this side has bits of 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.390
 sky 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.650
 and not in the rest of the country 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.840
 because they are enriched in iron and it is true what they do not say 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.359
 this iron of his burial we have no plant origin that touched us four 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.980
 very bad times that's why it's a very good idea as long as you take this kind of 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.659
 fortified foods taken together with a source of vitamin c 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.599
 like the orange red fruits that help our body absorb it days
