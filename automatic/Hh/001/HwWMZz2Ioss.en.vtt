00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
world with this pack a punch machine and
all<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.689> machines<00:01:31.110> coming<00:01:31.380> together<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
all these machines coming together for

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.780 
all these machines coming together for
the<00:01:32.400> ultimate<00:01:32.579> machine<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> V<00:01:33.960> R<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.770> ll<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the ultimate machine or the V R I ll the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
the ultimate machine or the V R I ll the
Vril<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> basically<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.990> ultimate

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
Vril which is basically the ultimate

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.359 
Vril which is basically the ultimate
machine<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.920> learned<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
machine which we learned about and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.080 
machine which we learned about and
called<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> dead<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:40.500> basically<00:01:41.100> Richthofen

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
called the dead but basically Richthofen

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
called the dead but basically Richthofen
after<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.600> insane<00:01:43.020> he<00:01:43.200> shuts<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> doors<00:01:43.979> on

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
after going insane he shuts the doors on

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
after going insane he shuts the doors on
Max's<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> Samantha<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.750> fluffy<00:01:46.170> kills

dying<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:02.070> before<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.640> Samantha

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
dying but before they do Samantha

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.780 
dying but before they do Samantha
teleports<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> she<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.860> turned<00:02:05.159> into<00:02:05.340> some

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
teleports and she is turned into some

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.740 
teleports and she is turned into some
sort<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.240> she's<00:02:07.079> caught<00:02:07.350> between<00:02:08.270> heaven<00:02:09.270> and

which<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.060> learn<00:02:33.269> about<00:02:33.299> in<00:02:33.569> moon<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.260> Max's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
which we learn about in moon but Max's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.509 
which we learn about in moon but Max's
basically<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.549> dead<00:02:35.879> but<00:02:36.480> his<00:02:36.989> form<00:02:37.739> will

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
basically is dead but his form will

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.009 
basically is dead but his form will
continue<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> live<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.269> as<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:40.670> now

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
basically Richthofen then basically

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
basically Richthofen then basically
isn't<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> race<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> he<00:02:46.769> goes<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> escape<00:02:47.640> now
