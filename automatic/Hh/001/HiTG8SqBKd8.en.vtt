see<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.810> spin<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.260> working<00:06:07.760> by<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.820> time<00:06:09.030> I

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
see the spin is working by the time I

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.830 
see the spin is working by the time I
got<00:06:09.210> the<00:06:09.360> camera<00:06:09.720> on

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840

all<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.560> water<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.190> I<00:06:12.250> put<00:06:12.490> in<00:06:12.639> came<00:06:13.030> out

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
all the water that I put in came out

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.530 
all the water that I put in came out
that<00:06:13.449> hose<00:06:16.110> so

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
that hose so

that hose so
by<00:06:19.050> all<00:06:19.230> accounts<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.240> looks<00:06:21.450> like<00:06:21.660> the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
by all accounts and it looks like the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:30.660 
by all accounts and it looks like the
motor

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.730
