00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.250
 good night the kind of signal for this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 week is to talk a little about the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.519
 alcoholic beverages and especially the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.059
 alcohol metabolism 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.129
 we currently have on facebook and in the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.779
 social networks a lot of 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.640
 information about drinks 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.919
 alcohol and the amount of calories 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.470
 which has precisely the intention of 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.509
 make this type alcoholic beverages 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.399
 they may generate calories but what 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.899
 we must understand and what should no longer 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.419
 keep happening in the culture 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.030
 nutrition is to believe that our system 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.610
 is a system of equations in which 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.860
 the food has calories in between 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.010
 let's say we have more calories 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 we have and more we gain weight is a vision 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.090
 very outdated human nutrition motors 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 human should be seen as a network 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.500
 complex of biochemical mechanisms to the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.260
 which the human body is subjected to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.649
 constantly depending on the substrate 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.960
 or the food that is consumed in the case 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.250
 of alcoholic beverages we have to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680
 understand that alcoholic ways 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.299
 obviously they have calories but the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.759
 metabolism that takes place 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.500
 mainly at the extra hepatic level is 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.070
 say that it does not take precisely to 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.800
 level 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.990
 liver or liver 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.420
 makes candles to colleagues have a 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.810
 behavior very different in terms 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.820
 assimilation synthesis and degradation 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.710
 Unlike other substrates such as 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.840
 the proteins the fats and the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.370
 carbohydrates in terms of lives 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.530
 alcoholic refers we have the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.700
 problem that the greater amount or 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.490
 concentration of alcoholic drink 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.470
 ingested our liver will stop 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.990
 work in an appropriate way this 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.760
 it means that the liver is going to block 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.040
 what is the pancake cycle and the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.740
 glycogenesis ie the formation of 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.080
 glucose from other substrates this 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.960
 is what facilitates the person the day 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.120
 of the hangover get up with a bit of 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.820
 cultural order each time due to the 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.480
 hypoglycemia that these drinks generate 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.770
 toxic levels in which we say 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.200
 depending on the dose response the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.640
 patient will feel the symptoms this 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.910
 means that the greatest concentration 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.130
 of alcohol and ethanol is also going to be 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.910
 degraded to a molecule that is called 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.220
 acetaldehyde in it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.260
 it can not be synthesized and this must be 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.300
 synthesized at extra level for this 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910
 means that they are tissues actually in 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.970
 which should take care of this 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 composed mainly the kidney and 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.490
 mainly the skeletal tissue the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.230
 muscle tissue and adipose tissue this 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.240
 generates a big problem because 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 when the person ingests alcohol and 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.910
 the food ingested concomitantly 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 liver being blocked what is going to 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.280
 to be primarily is to divert that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.180
 affluent of food to tissues of 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.830
 extra hepatic this to maintain a 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.500
 glucose concentration that can 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.390
 inhibit that genesis binding that can 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.430
 become fatal in some vomiting 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.420
 especially when side gets in the way 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.250
 big enough 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.459
 this must be understood a way 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.670
 let's say aesthetics since most of 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.390
 of the food that is going to be eaten 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.910
 concomitantly with drinks 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.099
 Alcoholics will be part of tissue 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.290
 adipose , which will facilitate the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.380
 person earn a few extra pounds on 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.380
 all fat tissue depending on whether the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.480
 feeding was done at the same time 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.030
 in the ingestion of alcoholic beverage or 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.250
 when it was done let's say after what 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.560
 Usually it happens when a person goes 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.540
 holiday party the person will be 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.030
 take on alcoholic beverages and more or 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.850
 less in the early morning is consuming 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.739
 food those foods that are going to 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.959
 consume will end in others 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.470
 bodies precisely because of that blockage of 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.610
 that liver blockade that the liver has 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.590
 obviously by the concentration of 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.160
 acetaldehyde that has alcohol 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.739
 then we have to stop seeing the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.660
 alcoholic drinks as something from source 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.640
 of calories mostly empty calories 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.769
 as some musicologists call it or 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.680
 nutritionists we should start to see 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.930
 this 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.819
 a biochemical mechanism that can 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.969
 promote weight gain 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.560
 depending on how the cycle is consumed 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.780
 trice nadal for this week consists 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.910
 in if we are going to take I'm going to do 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.250
 policies must be joint with a 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.039
 food so that it does not have that effect of 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.080
 adipose tissue gain what has been 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.389
 to avoid if you do not want to gain weight 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.850
 especially adipose tissue is not 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.500
 eat food after having 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.750
 ingested a sufficient amount of 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.520
 alcohol and this to give time to 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.039
 liver tissues for Ticos extra 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.919
 of what you are going to consume do not go to 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.919
 turn into arm tissue good evening
