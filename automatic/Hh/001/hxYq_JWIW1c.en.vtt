00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.950 
begin to populate various different
suggestions<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.360> things<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.690> might<00:02:40.810> be

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
suggestions of things you might be

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.130 
suggestions of things you might be
looking<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> here<00:02:43.210> this<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.540> triceps

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
looking for so here this is the triceps

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.160 
looking for so here this is the triceps
long<00:02:44.440> head<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.480> it'll<00:02:46.660> go<00:02:46.780> ahead<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.140> zoom

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
long head and it'll go ahead and zoom

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.370 
long head and it'll go ahead and zoom
into<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> gives<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.520> little<00:02:49.380> fox

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
into that and it gives you a little fox

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.230 
into that and it gives you a little fox
that<00:02:50.650> displays<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.460> name<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.120> you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
that displays the name of that or if you

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.260 
that displays the name of that or if you
want<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.450> look<00:02:55.600> at<00:02:55.810> something<00:02:56.560> different

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
want to look at something different

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:08.680 
want to look at something different
let's<00:02:58.270> look<00:02:58.690> at

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:19.540 

show<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> femur<00:03:09.830> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.070> leg

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.390 

and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.330> can<00:03:20.510> see<00:03:20.660> here<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:22.370> can

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
and then as you can see here you can

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.580 
and then as you can see here you can
pretty<00:03:23.360> much<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.750> looks<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.050> turn<00:03:24.290> off<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
pretty much it looks like turn off the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.400 
pretty much it looks like turn off the
layers<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> muscles<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.820> bones<00:03:26.410> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
layers of the muscles the bones the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.610 
layers of the muscles the bones the
nervous<00:03:27.710> system<00:03:28.100> circulatory<00:03:28.460> system<00:03:29.270> and

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
nervous system circulatory system and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:39.250 
nervous system circulatory system and
the<00:03:30.620> organs<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.880> brain

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.509 

so<00:03:39.830> again<00:03:40.220> just<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.549> real<00:03:41.180> quick<00:03:41.209> look<00:03:41.659> at<00:03:42.519> body

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
so again just a real quick look at body

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.149 
so again just a real quick look at body
browser<00:03:44.110> by<00:03:45.489> Google<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.640> their<00:03:47.540> Google<00:03:47.840> Labs

browser by Google and their Google Labs
this<00:03:49.159> is<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.519> one<00:03:49.939> example<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:51.430> they<00:03:52.430> have

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
this is just one example that they have

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.259 
this is just one example that they have
up<00:03:52.849> there<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.360> shows<00:03:53.629> how<00:03:54.590> WebGL<00:03:55.250> can<00:03:56.120> be

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
up there that shows how WebGL can be

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.380 
up there that shows how WebGL can be
used<00:03:56.560> for<00:03:57.560> various<00:03:58.099> different<00:03:58.459> forms<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.940> 3d

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
used for various different forms of 3d

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.210 
used for various different forms of 3d
visualization<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.349> i<00:04:00.379> recommend<00:04:00.709> check<00:04:01.069> it

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
visualization so i recommend check it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.660 
visualization so i recommend check it
out<00:04:01.659> WebGL<00:04:02.659> should<00:04:03.079> be<00:04:03.230> supported<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.010> all

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
out WebGL should be supported and all

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.550 
out WebGL should be supported and all
the<00:04:05.409> browser's<00:04:06.760> hopefully<00:04:07.760> by<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:09.409> beginning

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the browser's hopefully by the beginning

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:28.050 
the browser's hopefully by the beginning
of<00:04:09.829> next<00:04:09.890> year

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.100 

so<00:04:29.060> here<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.389> can<00:04:29.419> see<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:31.060> labels<00:04:32.060> which<00:04:32.990> are

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
so here you can see the labels which are

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:43.390 
so here you can see the labels which are
a<00:04:33.139> little<00:04:33.229> bit<00:04:33.410> small

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.090 

quick<00:04:44.060> look<00:04:44.270> at<00:04:44.979> Google<00:04:45.979> Labs<00:04:46.160> body<00:04:46.790> browser
