00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
alright today I'm be doing a review on

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.079 
alright today I'm be doing a review on
the<00:00:02.370> Casio<00:00:03.240> Reisman<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.640> this<00:00:05.640> watch<00:00:05.879> is

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
the Casio Reisman and this watch is

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.540 
the Casio Reisman and this watch is
basically<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.600> hybrid<00:00:06.960> between<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.680> casio

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
basically a hybrid between a casio

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.280 
basically a hybrid between a casio
pathfinder<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.730> g-shock<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.110> my

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
pathfinder and a g-shock so in my

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.379 
pathfinder and a g-shock so in my
opinion<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.980> offers<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.759> best<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.330> both

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
opinion it offers the best of both

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.590 
opinion it offers the best of both
worlds<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.619> offers<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.600> outdoor

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
worlds and that it offers the outdoor

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.400 
worlds and that it offers the outdoor
features<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.570> pathfinder<00:00:21.570> line<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
features of the pathfinder line and the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.380 
features of the pathfinder line and the
rugged<00:00:22.920> features<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.180> g-shock<00:00:24.660> line<00:00:24.930> so

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
rugged features of the g-shock line so

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.370 
rugged features of the g-shock line so
let's<00:00:27.390> look<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> couple<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> features

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
let's look at a couple of the features

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.690 
let's look at a couple of the features
that<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.920> watch<00:00:29.160> has<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.590> atomic<00:00:31.590> 6<00:00:32.369> band

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that this watch has it's a atomic 6 band

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.500 
that this watch has it's a atomic 6 band
watch<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:33.930> receive<00:00:34.460> signal<00:00:35.460> from<00:00:35.640> all

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
watch so it will receive signal from all

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.940 
watch so it will receive signal from all
6<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> atomic<00:00:38.160> towers<00:00:38.940> across<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> world

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
6 of the atomic towers across the world

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.630 
6 of the atomic towers across the world
it<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.219> also<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> solar<00:00:42.210> tough<00:00:42.540> watch<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it is also a solar tough watch so you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
it is also a solar tough watch so you
don't<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> worry<00:00:45.210> about<00:00:45.329> replacing<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
don't have to worry about replacing the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
don't have to worry about replacing the
battery<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:48.360> has<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.800> altimeter<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.190> barometer

going to be your timer mode should be a
countdown<00:03:58.470> timer<00:03:58.799> and<00:04:00.590> then<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:01.709> going<00:04:01.799> to

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
countdown timer and then you're going to

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.229 
countdown timer and then you're going to
have<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.190> alarm<00:04:02.489> screen<00:04:02.940> you're<00:04:03.090> going<00:04:03.180> to

of them with snooze so that's pretty
cool<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.380> then<00:04:10.380> your<00:04:10.560> last<00:04:10.769> mode<00:04:11.190> here<00:04:11.489> is

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
cool and then your last mode here is

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.600 
cool and then your last mode here is
going<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.820> be<00:04:12.060> your<00:04:12.630> record<00:04:13.260> screen<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.519> then

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
descent and it shows you the time and

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.430 
descent and it shows you the time and
date<00:04:46.349> for<00:04:46.379> all<00:04:46.740> these<00:04:47.069> so<00:04:47.789> that's<00:04:47.879> pretty<00:04:48.120> cool

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
date for all these so that's pretty cool

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.559

many feet you've gone up or gone down
sounds<00:05:52.469> pretty<00:05:52.650> cool<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.310> will<00:05:53.460> also<00:05:53.610> be

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
sounds pretty cool and that will also be

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.550 
sounds pretty cool and that will also be
recorded<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:56.009> record<00:05:56.960> screen<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.349> you<00:05:58.440> can

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.230 
you're in inches is in intervals of five
hundredths<00:06:57.460> so<00:06:58.460> it<00:06:58.610> could<00:06:58.760> be<00:06:58.790> a<00:06:58.910> little<00:06:59.150> bit

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
hundredths so it could be a little bit

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.150 
hundredths so it could be a little bit
more<00:06:59.420> accurate<00:06:59.960> I<00:07:00.080> mean<00:07:00.200> the<00:07:00.260> thermometer<00:07:00.950> is

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
more accurate I mean the thermometer is

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.430 
more accurate I mean the thermometer is
really<00:07:01.820> good<00:07:02.000> it<00:07:02.090> goes<00:07:02.210> in<00:07:02.390> decimal<00:07:03.050> points

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
really good it goes in decimal points

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.610 
really good it goes in decimal points
but<00:07:04.430> I<00:07:04.490> think<00:07:05.120> for<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.420> altimeter<00:07:06.170> and

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
but I think for the altimeter and

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.880 
but I think for the altimeter and
barometer<00:07:08.110> readings<00:07:09.110> it<00:07:09.380> should<00:07:09.650> have<00:07:09.860> a

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
barometer readings it should have a

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.820 
barometer readings it should have a
little<00:07:10.130> bit<00:07:10.220> more<00:07:10.370> accurate<00:07:11.000> and<00:07:11.870> also<00:07:12.200> I<00:07:12.440> got

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
little bit more accurate and also I got

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.310 
little bit more accurate and also I got
to<00:07:12.950> say<00:07:13.100> it's<00:07:13.280> not<00:07:13.610> as<00:07:13.820> accurate<00:07:14.600> as<00:07:14.720> my<00:07:14.870> Suunto

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
to say it's not as accurate as my Suunto

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.020 
to say it's not as accurate as my Suunto
core<00:07:17.320> but<00:07:18.320> I<00:07:18.590> mean<00:07:19.010> it's<00:07:19.220> almost<00:07:19.580> half<00:07:19.820> the

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
core but I mean it's almost half the

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.020 
core but I mean it's almost half the
price<00:07:20.180> and<00:07:20.680> in<00:07:21.680> my<00:07:21.950> opinion<00:07:22.070> has<00:07:22.460> got<00:07:22.670> more

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
price and in my opinion has got more

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.360 
price and in my opinion has got more
features<00:07:23.510> and<00:07:23.930> it's<00:07:24.050> an<00:07:24.200> all-around<00:07:24.680> better

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
features and it's an all-around better

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.660 
features and it's an all-around better

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990
