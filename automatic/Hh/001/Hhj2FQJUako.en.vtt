 well and breakfast at the hotel grand cruise times 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.340

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.810
 the difference between cruising gant cruise 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.640
 cruise means the number here in September is worth 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.600
 1100 of a person in a grand cruise 1300 with 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.330
 human but this is due to the fact that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.370
 tomorrow we have 50 rubles more than Brancusi and 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.520

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.100
 the pool in the cruise is not heated 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.070

 saw warmed up on a cruise no 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.770
 but in general, all you do not mind over 200 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.990
 rubles is better then of course in a grand cruise 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.850
