 Tereza a colleague a long time I 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.349
 I can not like it here on my channel 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
 but I have a business today 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.000
 interesting to show that that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.420
 hydraulic power steering pump from my 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.699
 core I'm going to show here how she 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.890
 and what are the parts that 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.830
 little intern takes the ball there what is the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 function of this pump it is necessary to use the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.420
 Oil steering box and this one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 This big piece here is the house is the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 carcass on the ball in here is a loop 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.360
 to a ball that already has the oil pressure 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 up to a spring on a quick turn but 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.219
 Let's go in time in a closet of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 effect of this bomb is here to polish 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.710
 the axis 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.780
 she also do not dismount the race here 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.780
 I think I did not need to, but to the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.820
 these pieces here these two call 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.640
 beauty 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.479
 the question that reminds you is the same 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.630
 bottom of the land that entered 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.530
 this is the same as that piece that the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.600
 rotor is surprised that he turned and kicked 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 Cinnamon here or become champion 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.830
 she has several accidents here was the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.020
 exchange with this one I have here and here 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.770
 a lot of palettes our little planet 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.470
 blue 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.470
 of these 40 your example the promoter 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.850
 all these actions to 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.070
 chinesinha serve just this piece here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 another took the cover here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.850
 I was just there 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.250
 now there are two tires of a car 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.800
 this is glove 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 then to the effect that way she 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.170
 it was leaking oil 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.530
 she has a retainer a game of zinho 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.530
 here o 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.350
 are the children alone in drawings 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.330
 tried to catch the day 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.210
 in this case of this pump that was this part 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.490
 that burst and tried and tried to get in 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.650
 back part 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.480
 it fits here tÃ¡ 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.620
 when the story begins the mass looks 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.930
 here ends the legislation and cartoon 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.160
 take a seat, I'll explain 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.100
 more or less by some how 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.970
 how assembly works are people 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.650
 fit into that inferior to the next one 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.400
 the glove that the tires is to make a 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.110
 meeting that gives the tables with the student 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.739
 the legend that so you boot here in the middle 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.739
 She'll keep it here and put it right here. 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.640
 O to the florim here 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.480
 I chose here to do 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.550
 briguel serve the team picks up again 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.990
 lower but let's ride now I'm just going 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:19.750
 explain how it is 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:26.670
 then the school Paul saw the rotor at the table 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.670
 okay and makes it more or less distant 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.580
 Of course I did not put there too. 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 palettes here from behind take the 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.640
 in the world wants to place and punish 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.500
 so when she turns here 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.350
 she makes a move there she turns the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 into the little engine and move the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.380
 beauty oil loss 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.380
 so that's what opens this ball here 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.650
 I'm doing this to explain more or 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.120
 less the operation of the pump better 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.310
