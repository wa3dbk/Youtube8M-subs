00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.420 
played and some of you were kind of
confused<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:06.960> i<00:01:07.350> uploaded<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.979> commentary

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
confused because i uploaded a commentary

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.450 
confused because i uploaded a commentary
not<00:01:08.909> too<00:01:09.060> long<00:01:09.210> ago<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.450> drunk<00:01:09.810> commentary<00:01:10.460> but

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
want seven sensitivity because i am at

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.859 
want seven sensitivity because i am at
which<00:01:49.020> player<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.500> cod<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.659> kind

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
which player in cod so you know I kind

which player in cod so you know I kind
of<00:01:51.990> twitch<00:01:52.170> around<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.680> can't<00:01:53.040> play<00:01:53.159> on

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
of twitch around here i can't play on

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.330 
of twitch around here i can't play on
low<00:01:53.460> sensitivities<00:01:54.710> benefit<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.890> playing<00:01:56.219> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
low sensitivities benefit of playing on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.270 
low sensitivities benefit of playing on
high<00:01:56.520> sensitivity<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
high sensitivity is that you can get the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670 
high sensitivity is that you can get the
first<00:01:59.490> shot<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.899> easier<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
first shot off a lot easier because you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.149 
first shot off a lot easier because you
can<00:02:01.829> move<00:02:02.100> your<00:02:02.159> reticle<00:02:02.729> faster<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:04.350> when

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
can move your reticle faster but when

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.719 
can move your reticle faster but when
you're<00:02:05.280> playing<00:02:05.430> core<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.750> SWAT<00:02:07.729> it's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you're playing core like not SWAT it's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
you're playing core like not SWAT it's
better<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.090> below<00:02:09.330> sensitivity<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> can

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
better down below sensitivity so you can

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.400 
better down below sensitivity so you can
accurately<00:02:10.950> hit<00:02:11.280> shots

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
accurately hit shots

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.980 
accurately hit shots
but<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> kind<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:13.970> depends<00:02:14.240> on<00:02:14.360> preference<00:02:14.810> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
but it kind of depends on preference to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.810 
but it kind of depends on preference to
because<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.500> seen<00:02:15.740> some<00:02:16.010> extremely<00:02:16.580> good

because I have seen some extremely good

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.770
