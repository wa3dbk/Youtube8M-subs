00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.510
 how are you guys good today I come 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.540
 pretty burned out of the work I've had 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.510
 to do more hours than usual 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.620
 I can not even rest to eat my media 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.510
 hour 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.779
 and the truth is that I am dead 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.259
 very tired I do not feel like anything 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.570
 nothing less to train do not let the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.790
 factors external to you 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.540
 control the emotions and your 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.259
 personality is worth being yourselves 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.630
 regardless of what happens 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.180
 around you there is where 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.829
 you truly know the person of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.469
 each one what is truly 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.469
 inside you we are going to train 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 i 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 well today I will comment over 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 all the video to see exactly what 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.420
 it seems please tell me and very 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.150
 quickly this is juanjo one of the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.030
 owners of the gym nirvana always 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.220
 working late and good today I 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.009
 you are going to see do legs concretely 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.470
 squats here you will see me warming up 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.869
 with the bar and later you will see me 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.119
 delaying the cage since being the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.030
 mirror so close I felt a little 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.820
 locked up and training I do not want that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 I want to be expansive I want to express myself 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 feel comfortable doing the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.689
 different exercises 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.360
 and good to have little so little energy 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.450
 I just did squats since I wanted to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.579
 let's say let's get the most out of it and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.270
 for my squats it has to be the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.399
 better leg exercise because that's not 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 I was able to finish a workout 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.840
 of an hour I say I'm going to make a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.100
 exercise but I'll do the best 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 I can already give everything 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.409
 and that to what I was before as 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.170
 you listened to the beginning of the video today 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.959
 it was not one of my best days I did not 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.090
 I had a great time physically at work 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.360
 and mentally I was a bit defeated 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.330
 but in spite of all that gather all 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.420
 the forces and concentration for 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.550
 do everything I had to do and that 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.459
 is what I meant at the beginning of 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.860
 video when they squeeze you when you see 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.150
 in uncomfortable situations that force you 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.400
 to react or respond truly 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.980
 out what you have inside and that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.290
 It is the reason that many people to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.769
 Realize an objective or some goal 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.410
 difficult to be squeezed as much as possible 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.350
 can say that they are finding or 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.900
 knowing who they really are and from 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.830
 What are facts but good will 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.049
 I want to bore you with all this talk in 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.690
 quickly recapitulate before 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.319
 started the heating with the bar 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.629
 then later with 60 kilos 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.939
 and now I'm with doing my first 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.749
 work series of specifically 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:16.749
 strength with about 100 kilos in squat 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:19.689
 5 for 5 that is costing me a lot 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:22.260
 but I'm very happy because 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.760
 three months had I needed help no 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.799
 this is a juanjo tattoo that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.799
 lately I'm really enjoying the 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.400
 tattoos on the body and I'm almost 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.889
 sure that soon I will 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.709
 I will also make one or several good 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.629
 we go back quickly to 5 for 5 and 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.849
 I wanted to comment on a method that he used 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.159
 which is called the valsalva method and it 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.099
 try as you see to inspire endures the 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.310
 breathing on the descent swelling the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.219
 stomach like a balloon that puts pressure 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.769
 against against the legs creating the 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:01.239
 effect of like an invisible belt that 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.939
 supports you supports you and you feel like a 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.970
 block no safer so you can 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.190
 wait for that video in future videos 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.690
 my training is over, forgive me 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.670
 I did not have more material 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.950
 the next video will be training with 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.440
 a subscriber has gone very well I'm 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.360
 very happy thank you for the comments 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.970
 I like them because I always value them 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.940
 very much and to finish the video I'm going 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.500
 to leave with my last series of 5 by 5 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.880
 so you can see that despite that 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.650
 defeated feeling I was wearing 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.560
 over before training 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.050
 I have removed everything I had inside what 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.510
 is what I wanted to do and what I knew 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.790
 that I had to do so as I have 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.300
 said thank you very much for being there and 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.300
 to train 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.710
 yes 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.790
 why 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.230
 above
