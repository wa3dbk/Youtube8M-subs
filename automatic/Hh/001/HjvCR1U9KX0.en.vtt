00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the formula on this kind of reminds me

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.740 
the formula on this kind of reminds me
of<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.770> cream<00:03:02.160> Sheen<00:03:02.520> or<00:03:02.550> luster<00:03:03.210> by<00:03:03.450> Mac

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.850 
w25 now that I'm self-tanning but I
don't<00:03:24.510> know<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.750> kind<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.380> feel<00:03:25.470> like

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
don't know I kind of like it I feel like

don't know I kind of like it I feel like
it<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.220> pulls<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.670> blue<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.600> it's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
it kind of pulls out the blue and it's

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.810 
it kind of pulls out the blue and it's
definitely<00:03:28.230> something<00:03:28.350> different<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.220> that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
definitely something different so that

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.290 
definitely something different so that
is<00:03:30.060> freedom<00:03:31.040> okay<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.250> think<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.700> one<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:32.940> one

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
is freedom okay I think this one is one

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.150 
is freedom okay I think this one is one
of<00:03:33.420> my<00:03:33.510> favorites<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.620> Jennifer's

of<00:03:38.910> references<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.480> her<00:03:39.570> but<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.990> think

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
of references to her but I just think

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.770 
of references to her but I just think
she's<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.320> beautiful<00:03:40.770> and<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:42.060> would<00:03:42.150> love<00:03:42.630> to

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
she's so beautiful and I would love to

have her skin and her body and
everything<00:03:45.150> when<00:03:45.540> I'm<00:03:45.720> like<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.080> don't<00:03:46.170> know

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
everything when I'm like I don't know

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.360 
everything when I'm like I don't know
how<00:03:46.380> she<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.830> think<00:03:46.860> she's<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
how she is but I think she's on the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.540 
how she is but I think she's on the
downhill<00:03:47.820> side<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.060> 40<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:49.050> 40<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.430> is

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
downhill side of 40 if not 40 so this is

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.970 
downhill side of 40 if not 40 so this is
JLo<00:03:50.940> as<00:03:51.090> nude<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.410> what<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> looks<00:03:52.860> like

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
JLo as nude this is what it looks like

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.650 
JLo as nude this is what it looks like
in<00:03:53.370> comparison<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> other<00:03:54.240> ones<00:03:54.480> it's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
in comparison to the other ones it's

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.440 
in comparison to the other ones it's
kind<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.050> like<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> lighter<00:03:55.980> version<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.730> this

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
kind of like a lighter version of this

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.480 
kind of like a lighter version of this
first<00:03:57.720> one<00:03:57.960> but<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> formula<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.830> similar<00:03:59.130> to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
first one but the formula is similar to

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.920 
first one but the formula is similar to
the<00:03:59.580> freitas<00:03:59.940> where<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.330> little<00:04:00.450> bit<00:04:00.600> more

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the freitas where it's a little bit more

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.720 
the freitas where it's a little bit more
of<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.140> formula<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> kind<00:04:02.460> of<00:04:02.520> have<00:04:02.610> to

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
of a formula that it kind of have to

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.520 
of a formula that it kind of have to
build<00:04:02.880> up<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.240> little<00:04:03.330> bit<00:04:03.600> but<00:04:04.140> it's<00:04:04.260> quite

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
build up a little bit but it's quite

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.680 
build up a little bit but it's quite
moisturizing<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.580> lips<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.480> like

category<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:40.039> one<00:04:40.280> kinda<00:04:40.669> reminds<00:04:40.970> me<00:04:41.090> of

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
category this one kinda reminds me of

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.350 
category this one kinda reminds me of
cream<00:04:41.539> cup<00:04:41.810> by<00:04:41.990> Mac<00:04:42.430> now<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.490> formula<00:04:43.970> on<00:04:44.150> this

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
cream cup by Mac now the formula on this

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.540 
cream cup by Mac now the formula on this
one<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.690> more<00:04:45.110> similar<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.740> first<00:04:46.009> one<00:04:46.130> Eva

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
one is more similar to the first one Eva

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.580 
one is more similar to the first one Eva
I<00:04:46.729> would<00:04:47.030> say<00:04:47.150> Eve<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.509> most<00:04:47.810> opaque<00:04:48.289> and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
I would say Eve is the most opaque and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.350 
I would say Eve is the most opaque and
then<00:04:49.130> these<00:04:49.280> two<00:04:49.550> we<00:04:49.669> are<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:49.880> little<00:04:50.060> bit<00:04:50.240> more

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
then these two we are a little bit more

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.700 
then these two we are a little bit more
sure<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.720> do<00:04:50.870> have<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.110> build<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.380> color<00:04:51.620> a

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
sure you do have to build the color a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.950 
sure you do have to build the color a
little<00:04:51.800> bit<00:04:52.039> but<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.360> crazy<00:04:53.630> where

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
little bit but it's not that crazy where

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.300 
little bit but it's not that crazy where
you<00:04:54.050> build<00:04:54.259> it<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.650> don't<00:04:54.800> actually<00:04:55.070> get

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
you build it and you don't actually get

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.240 
you build it and you don't actually get
a<00:04:55.370> result<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.840> then<00:04:57.020> this<00:04:57.169> last<00:04:57.440> one<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
a result and then this last one is the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.670 
a result and then this last one is the
julienne<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.270> really<00:04:59.570> similar<00:04:59.810> in<00:04:59.990> coverage

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
julienne is really similar in coverage

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.850 
julienne is really similar in coverage
to<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.190> Eva<00:05:01.660> overall<00:05:02.660> I'm<00:05:02.990> really<00:05:03.650> liking

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
to the Eva overall I'm really liking

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.060

these<00:05:04.130> lipsticks<00:05:04.639> I'm<00:05:04.880> finding<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.389> the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
these lipsticks I'm finding that the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.430 
these lipsticks I'm finding that the
great<00:05:07.070> color<00:05:07.400> selection<00:05:08.060> on<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:09.110> one<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.410> I

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
great color selection on the one that I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.409 
great color selection on the one that I
did<00:05:09.650> not<00:05:09.800> pick<00:05:10.009> up<00:05:10.039> what<00:05:11.000> was<00:05:11.150> it<00:05:11.270> called

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
did not pick up what was it called

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.589 
did not pick up what was it called
douche<00:05:12.259> Dudesons<00:05:12.889> nude<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.970> one<00:05:14.150> was<00:05:14.330> really

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
douche Dudesons nude that one was really

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.089 
douche Dudesons nude that one was really
pink<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.110> I<00:05:15.139> was<00:05:15.259> afraid<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.889> was<00:05:15.949> gonna

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
pink and I was afraid that it was gonna

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.969 
pink and I was afraid that it was gonna
be<00:05:16.310> too<00:05:16.550> pink<00:05:16.849> for<00:05:17.090> me<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.680> probably<00:05:18.680> could<00:05:18.949> have

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
be too pink for me I probably could have

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.740 
be too pink for me I probably could have
got<00:05:19.160> away<00:05:19.370> with<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.610> but<00:05:19.910> if<00:05:20.090> something's<00:05:20.539> too

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
got away with it but if something's too

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.570 
got away with it but if something's too
light<00:05:20.930> for<00:05:20.960> me<00:05:21.259> personally<00:05:21.500> it<00:05:21.919> just<00:05:21.949> doesn't

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
light for me personally it just doesn't

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.249 
light for me personally it just doesn't
it's<00:05:22.729> not<00:05:22.789> flattering<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.539> then<00:05:24.020> I'm<00:05:24.110> not

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
it's not flattering and then I'm not

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's not flattering and then I'm not
sure<00:05:24.410> what<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.620> sixth<00:05:24.889> one<00:05:25.039> was<00:05:25.070> because<00:05:25.400> they

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
sure what the sixth one was because they

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.370 
sure what the sixth one was because they
only<00:05:25.669> had<00:05:25.880> five<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.360> six<00:05:26.539> at<00:05:26.750> my<00:05:26.870> Walgreens
