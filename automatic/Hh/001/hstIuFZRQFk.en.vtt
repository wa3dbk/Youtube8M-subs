00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.970
 Welcome to my actions and 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.270
 cake world points i want you 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.150
 show how you made fruit and vegetables 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.539
 simple food coloring on natural basis 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.609
 I can use it for iris 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.769
 yes, not so much food color 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.179
 That's why I have these attempts 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.259
 made and have a lot 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.839
 get out 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.079
 However, you can with these colors 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:34.149
 what I got out of here cream 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:37.300
 stain cream or cake soil 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.850
 from then you can not dye it and 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.179
 I think you should just have a look 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 where you do without food coloring 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.339
 can and where it needs to be completely you can 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.149
 Of course, do not do without the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.670
 Possibility has creams or pies 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.359
 pie crust with natural food 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
 to color 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.839
 then you should not get up immediately 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.420
 grab food color 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.030
 I made some attempts and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.120
 I also got many colors out 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.690
 I hope you like these olives 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.030
 in a shell I have the core 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.880
 taken out here and water into it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.370
 I have always filled the water 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.820
 again replaced four to five times 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.150
 So let's exchange 23 hours in it 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.190
 new water so that the salt go out 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.560
 can still be olives then I will 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.730
 Boil once 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 so that the color becomes intense and 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.300
 let cool down 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.460
 but I think I have a bit 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.750
 Water and blueberries in a pot 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.600
 into it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.900
 and who is then boil give 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.540
 really good, the whole thing out 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.400
 could last a bit longer 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 Add a little sugar 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.590
 because with a victory just 7 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.400
 and let it cool completely 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.890
 only need the water try it 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.350
 with red cabbage I have probably just small 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.970
 cut in with a bit of water 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.960
 given a pot and will from 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.130
 bring to the boil 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.870
 the longer the more intense then 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.670
 also the ride so that it is my result 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 of red cabbage 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.250
 I think that's easy through a sieve 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.620
 trying to give onions her take 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.140
 just red onions and only the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 outer shell just take nice 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.730
 wash with a bit of water 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.300
 bring to the boil 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.280
 that is my result with the red ones 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.880
 I could have onionskin color green 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.470
 then parsley on but even more intense 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.820
 you can of course with a 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.560
 mixing blender and then through a sieve 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.290
 give 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.379
 this is my result from brazil 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.599
 nice reason I got out of there 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:04.560
 afterwards beet yields a result 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.140
 beetroot and carrots, of course spinach 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.660
 i just cut it up and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 added to the water in 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.459
 So my spinach cooks cradle thing by 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.120
 her then touches also gets her 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.700
 an intense color that is mine 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.030
 spinach after tasting this i 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.099
 I must say I have a very nice green house 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.349
 Of course, the colors are always there 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.290
 intense when cooked but 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.239
 if you then purchase with whipped cream 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.489
 you will not get brighter, please 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.370
 always forget to add sugar with you 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.860
 this makes the color more intense and more 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:48.390
 you also get longer next 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.970
 Try paprika sweet as well 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.299
 heat up a bit to roast me right 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.459
 I simply have my dad powder 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.500
 get cold and with a bit 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.230
 water I want to see what's there 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.930
 come out for a color so I have 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.850
 really great colors created now 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.329
 I'll try with these 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.850
 color easy to be beat cream 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.310
 we live now I show you mine 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.820
 results i really have to say i am 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.720
 really excited us was I'll start 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.800
 here at 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.320
 this is my color of red cabbage 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.190
 that's a really nice league 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.360
 become 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.150
 then onionskin threatened that it was one 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.240
 salmon colored ones have also become blueberries 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 really beautiful purple pink me already 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.280
 beetroot is a very nice pink 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.450
 Black olives have become like that too 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.800
 cream salmon has become carrot quite bright 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.340
 orange parsley is really pastel 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.889
 went green so my last two 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.950
 so try spider has spinach 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.950
 I get out a really great green 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.500
 red paprika powder look something for a 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.500
 nice color I got there that is 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.980
 rust brown fashion so soon you can 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.950
 say 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.180
 I tasted everything it tastes 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.770
 Everything was super delicious and Beiboote 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.220
 I have been skeptical of paprika powder so far 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.830
 but that tastes best 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:28.040
 this paprika powder has another one 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.450
 note get hearty sweet so that is 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.510
 really tasty 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.270
 clearly you can now with these colors 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.880
 do not dye a fondant 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.590
 the colors are simply mixed together 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.290
 to see what kind of color I am 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.100
 I got it from it then I have beautiful 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.500
 dark room color has to get real 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.600
 I also said the results 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.450
 I'm really surprised now too 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.310
 not thought that I have such great colors 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.800
 Of course I will mine 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.320
 blow cream not thrown away and 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.320
 the Curia equal missed my pie 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.389
 at the impact cream unfortunately not for 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.000
 was enough the whole pie I have 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.590
 then the pages just with sugar 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.740
 streusel looked after 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.620
 as I said that was just so I mean mine 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.820
 blow cream does not have to throw away that 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.830
 would be a pity 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.350
 after trying so many 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.070
 I have then just this cake 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.979
 baked 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.280
 I hope you like me 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.800
 happy if you really do that and 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.680
 if you share this video further and 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.139
 we would become if you also say so 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.570
 knows how to create a different color 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.930
 of course I can look forward to each one 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.930
 feedback
