little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> have

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
little bit and you don't have to have

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit and you don't have to have
too<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.590> else<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.010> get

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
too much on there else it's gonna get

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.740 
too much on there else it's gonna get
cakey<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> crease<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> look

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.010 
and then I added another layer of
mascara<00:05:54.879> because<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.330> kind<00:05:55.509> of<00:05:55.599> like<00:05:55.750> the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020

your<00:06:06.189> waterline<00:06:06.520> I<00:06:06.909> just<00:06:07.270> think<00:06:07.419> that<00:06:07.539> this

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 
your waterline I just think that this

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
ties that look together and makes it

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.550 
ties that look together and makes it
look<00:06:09.129> a<00:06:09.219> little<00:06:09.310> more<00:06:09.460> sultry<00:06:09.969> I<00:06:10.539> don't<00:06:11.110> know
