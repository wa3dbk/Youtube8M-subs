00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
out of the box I wound it up I kind of

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.160 
out of the box I wound it up I kind of
tangled<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.820> up<00:00:51.969> and<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.269> put<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.600> down<00:00:52.840> in<00:00:52.870> the

tangled it up and I put it down in the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.319 
tangled it up and I put it down in the
water<00:00:53.320> just<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.309> give<00:00:54.640> something<00:00:54.969> kind<00:00:55.300> of

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
water just to give something kind of

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.849 
water just to give something kind of
interesting<00:00:55.510> flowing<00:00:56.379> through<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.679> water

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
interesting flowing through the water

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.439 
interesting flowing through the water
and<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.070> think<00:00:57.280> it's<00:00:57.429> just<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.730> really<00:00:58.059> really

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
and I think it's just a really really

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.169 
and I think it's just a really really
neat<00:00:58.809> play<00:00:59.170> with<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.559> color<00:00:59.769> red<00:01:00.039> one<00:01:00.879> thing<00:01:01.089> I

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
neat play with the color red one thing I

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.790 
neat play with the color red one thing I
think<00:01:01.239> people<00:01:01.539> get<00:01:01.750> hung<00:01:02.019> up<00:01:02.140> with<00:01:02.350> sometimes

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
think people get hung up with sometimes

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.220 
think people get hung up with sometimes
as<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.190> fact<00:01:03.429> that<00:01:03.579> they<00:01:03.850> actually<00:01:04.089> are<00:01:04.930> so

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
as the fact that they actually are so

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.190 
as the fact that they actually are so
worried<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.460> red<00:01:06.760> of<00:01:07.120> one<00:01:07.660> thing<00:01:07.930> and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
worried that the red of one thing and

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.310 
worried that the red of one thing and
the<00:01:08.500> red<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:09.159> another<00:01:09.700> item<00:01:10.119> are<00:01:10.509> two

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the red of another item are two

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.929 
the red of another item are two
different<00:01:11.680> colors<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.280> think<00:01:12.549> if<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.759> have

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
different colors and I think if you have

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.609 
different colors and I think if you have
different<00:01:13.180> shades<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.659> red<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:13.900> use<00:01:14.229> those<00:01:14.380> in

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
different shades of red and use those in

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.380 
different shades of red and use those in
combination<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.369> just<00:01:15.579> creates<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.119> really

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
combination it just creates a really

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.410 
combination it just creates a really
rich<00:01:16.810> rich<00:01:17.200> wonderful<00:01:18.189> look<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.060> think<00:01:19.150> this

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
rich rich wonderful look so I think this

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.060 
rich rich wonderful look so I think this
is<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> great<00:01:19.810> way<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.110> do<00:01:20.350> something<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.009> a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070
