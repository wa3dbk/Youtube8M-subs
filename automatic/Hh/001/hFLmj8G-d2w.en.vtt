I don't know body work at all but I kind
of<00:00:15.389> mocked<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> car<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.010> gonna<00:00:17.220> look

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
of mocked up how the car is gonna look

more<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:28.140> whatever<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.920> guys

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
more I don't know whatever you guys

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
more I don't know whatever you guys
think<00:00:29.269> let<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.439> you'll

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
think let me know on that one but you'll

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
think let me know on that one but you'll
see<00:00:32.059> down<00:00:33.079> there

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
see down there

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.180 
see down there
I've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.329> carbon<00:00:36.329> fiber<00:00:36.770> more<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:37.860> less<00:00:37.980> like

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I've got carbon fiber more or less like

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
I've got carbon fiber more or less like
trimming<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> car<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:40.079> goal<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
trimming the car out so my goal is

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.619 
trimming the car out so my goal is
obvious<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> functional<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> bottom<00:00:42.239> for

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
obvious is functional at the bottom for

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.080 
obvious is functional at the bottom for
you<00:00:43.410> no<00:00:43.500> scuffing<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you no scuffing that and when I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.569 
you no scuffing that and when I
inevitably<00:00:45.360> bottomed<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.460> also

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
inevitably bottomed out but it also

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.060 
inevitably bottomed out but it also
looks<00:00:47.910> cool<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> front<00:00:49.739> with

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
looks cool so you got the front with

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
looks cool so you got the front with
carbon<00:00:50.520> fiber<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.210> middle<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.690> carbon

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
carbon fiber the middle with carbon

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.360 
carbon fiber the middle with carbon
fiber<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:53.250> leaves<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.210> rear<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.829> went<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
fiber that leaves the rear I went and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.420 
fiber that leaves the rear I went and
got<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.649> one-off<00:00:58.649> made

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
got a one-off made

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
got a one-off made
I<00:00:59.460> mean<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.090> not<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> first<00:01:00.480> guy<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
replacing that but it's all carbon fiber

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.820 
replacing that but it's all carbon fiber
as<00:01:11.460> well<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> detail<00:01:13.619> there

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
they're gonna be more smooth you know

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
they're gonna be more smooth you know
kind<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.430> flush<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> body

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
kind of like flush with the body

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
kind of like flush with the body
they<00:01:39.900> aren't<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.530> frog<00:01:40.829> eyes<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
switch up soon and I've got tuning a lot

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.330 
switch up soon and I've got tuning a lot
of<00:01:51.270> tuning<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.070> messed<00:01:53.250> with

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
of tuning is they you know messed with

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.990 
of tuning is they you know messed with
my<00:01:53.579> new<00:01:53.939> air<00:01:54.119> filter<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.750> water<00:01:54.960> injection

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
my new air filter and water injection

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
got a new hood coming in so you know why

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.120 
got a new hood coming in so you know why
mount<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> hoods<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.770> know

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
mount this if the hoods you know

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.550 
mount this if the hoods you know
say<00:02:14.280> half<00:02:14.910> an<00:02:15.060> issue<00:02:15.210> shorter<00:02:16.020> or<00:02:16.170> something

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
say half an issue shorter or something

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.020 
say half an issue shorter or something
you<00:02:17.010> don't<00:02:17.130> want<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> mount<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.610> because<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you don't want to mount this because it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.110 
you don't want to mount this because it
all<00:02:18.410> sandwiches<00:02:19.410> together<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.700> know

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
all sandwiches together so I don't know

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
all sandwiches together so I don't know
the<00:02:21.240> front<00:02:21.450> mounted<00:02:21.750> because<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.410> know<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the front mounted because you know you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.380 
the front mounted because you know you
can<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> lot<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.460> cars<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:23.970> modified

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
can see a lot of cars that are modified

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.110 
can see a lot of cars that are modified
they'll<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.460> know<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.670> gap<00:02:26.880> right

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
they'll have you know this gap right

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.450 
they'll have you know this gap right
here<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.480> huge<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.430> I

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
here will be huge so you know that I

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.640 
here will be huge so you know that I
guess<00:02:29.970> as<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> general<00:02:30.630> rule<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.840> thumb<00:02:30.900> I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
guess as a general rule of thumb I'm

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.530 
guess as a general rule of thumb I'm
gonna<00:02:31.830> start<00:02:31.980> with<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> hood<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.940> then

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
gonna start with the hood first and then

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.700 
gonna start with the hood first and then
mount<00:02:34.500> everything<00:02:34.770> else<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:36.180> complement<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
mount everything else to complement it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.650 
mount everything else to complement it
so<00:02:37.790> that's<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.270> guys<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.540> any

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
so that's it if you guys have any

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.830 
so that's it if you guys have any
questions<00:02:40.520> I'll<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> video<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.630> car

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
questions I'll have a video of this car

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.070 
questions I'll have a video of this car
firing<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.320> pretty<00:02:43.500> soon<00:02:43.680> otherwise
