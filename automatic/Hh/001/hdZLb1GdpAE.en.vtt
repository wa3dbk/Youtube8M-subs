may not be enough for you you might need
to<00:05:16.270> get<00:05:16.420> Photoshop<00:05:16.960> if<00:05:17.140> you<00:05:17.290> are<00:05:17.470> a

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
to get Photoshop if you are a

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.900 
to get Photoshop if you are a
professional<00:05:17.920> photographer<00:05:18.250> but<00:05:18.820> you

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
professional photographer but you

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.130 
professional photographer but you
probably<00:05:19.090> already<00:05:19.300> know<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.690> if<00:05:19.840> that's<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
probably already know that if that's the

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.440 
probably already know that if that's the
case<00:05:20.320> for<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.310> rest<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.640> us<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:22.090> GIMP<00:05:22.330> is

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
case for the rest of us the GIMP is

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.700 
case for the rest of us the GIMP is
probably<00:05:22.780> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.080> everything<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.650> we

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
probably going to do everything that we

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.460 
probably going to do everything that we
need<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:24.640> I<00:05:24.670> mentioned<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.480> my<00:05:25.930> bonus<00:05:26.350> is

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
need so I mentioned that my bonus is

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.800 
need so I mentioned that my bonus is
going<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.710> cover<00:05:26.920> what<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:27.700> see<00:05:28.060> is<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.420> biggest

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
going to cover what I see is the biggest

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.030 
going to cover what I see is the biggest
flaw<00:05:29.140> in<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:29.530> program<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.450> that<00:05:31.450> is<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:32.140> he

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
flaw in this program and that is that he

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.880 
flaw in this program and that is that he
does<00:05:33.310> mention<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:35.350> GIMP<00:05:35.590> is<00:05:35.710> an

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
does mention that the GIMP is an

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.650 
does mention that the GIMP is an
alternative<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.580> photoshop<00:05:37.120> but<00:05:37.420> that's

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
alternative to photoshop but that's

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.300 
alternative to photoshop but that's
about<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.110> extent<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.620> it<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.980> know<00:05:39.010> it<00:05:39.220> would

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
about the extent of it you know it would

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.060 
about the extent of it you know it would
be<00:05:39.430> nice<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.940> cover<00:05:40.900> how<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.290> use<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.860> GIMP

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
be nice to cover how to use the GIMP

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.280 
be nice to cover how to use the GIMP
instead<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.610> photoshop<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:43.690> he<00:05:43.840> gives<00:05:44.020> a<00:05:44.110> lot

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
instead of photoshop so he gives a lot

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.110 
instead of photoshop so he gives a lot
of<00:05:44.320> instructionals<00:05:45.070> on<00:05:45.220> using<00:05:45.550> Photoshop

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
of instructionals on using Photoshop

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.420 
of instructionals on using Photoshop
