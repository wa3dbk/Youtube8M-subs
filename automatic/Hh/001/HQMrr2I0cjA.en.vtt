that<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.640> knew<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> beginning<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.689> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that we knew from the beginning that we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
that we knew from the beginning that we
want<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.229> goblins<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.280> really

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
want to do goblins and there was really

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
want to do goblins and there was really
a<00:01:38.820> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> debate<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.630> how<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.930> should<00:01:40.320> do

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a lot of debate on how we should do

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
a lot of debate on how we should do
goblins<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.280> should<00:01:41.640> goblins<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
goblins and should goblins be on one of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.149 
goblins and should goblins be on one of
the<00:01:42.600> sides<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.380> should<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:43.770> try<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the sides or should we maybe try to do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.590 
the sides or should we maybe try to do
them<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> neutral<00:01:44.729> race<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.329> want<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
them as a neutral race or how we want to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
them as a neutral race or how we want to
do<00:01:45.750> them<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:46.890> also<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
do them and and there's also a lot of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219 
do them and and there's also a lot of
people<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> team<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.810> felt

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
people I think on the team that felt

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.480 
people I think on the team that felt
like<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.500> may<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.250> goofy

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like there may be a little bit too goofy

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
like there may be a little bit too goofy
you<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.659> need<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> add

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you know like do we really need to add

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.580 
you know like do we really need to add
another<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.070> gnome<00:01:53.280> style<00:01:53.640> race<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
another kind of gnome style race so you

came<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.420> later<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:59.009> through

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
came on later and it was really through

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.039 
came on later and it was really through
just<00:01:59.549> some<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> art<00:02:00.329> team<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.840> drawing

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

just some of the art team really drawing
some<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.530> cool<00:02:01.680> concepts<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.430> really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
some really cool concepts that really

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.359 
some really cool concepts that really
kind<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.969> gathered<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.630> momentum<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.500> would

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
kind of gathered that momentum I would

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.930 
kind of gathered that momentum I would
say<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.270> most<00:02:06.390> surprising<00:02:06.960> thing<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> me

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
say the most surprising thing to me

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.000

like a fan it's really been really fun I
think<00:02:33.140> any<00:02:33.650> time<00:02:33.710> that<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.160> make<00:02:34.370> an

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
think any time that you make an

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.160 
think any time that you make an
entertainment<00:02:35.240> product<00:02:35.450> or<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:35.960> make<00:02:36.140> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
entertainment product or you make a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.780 
entertainment product or you make a
fantasy<00:02:36.860> world<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.340> anything<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
fantasy world or anything like that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.030 
fantasy world or anything like that
you're<00:02:38.630> never<00:02:38.840> going<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.110> expect<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.620> success

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you're never going to expect a success

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.070 
you're never going to expect a success
like<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.610> level<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.910> World<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.480> Warcraft<00:02:41.570> and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
like the level of World of Warcraft and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.110 
like the level of World of Warcraft and
certainly<00:02:42.470> not<00:02:42.800> expect<00:02:43.370> people<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.700> fall<00:02:44.000> in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
certainly not expect people to fall in

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.820 
certainly not expect people to fall in
love<00:02:44.270> with<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.660> lower<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.170> world<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.710> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
love with the lower in the world to the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.860 
love with the lower in the world to the
degree<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.400> they<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.720> something

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
degree that they do it's just something

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.350 
degree that they do it's just something
that<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.650> we<00:02:49.460> just<00:02:49.580> take<00:02:49.790> immense<00:02:50.060> pride

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
that I think we just take immense pride

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.030 
that I think we just take immense pride
in<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.630> fact<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.020> you'll<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.770> able<00:02:51.860> to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
in the fact that you'll be able to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.380 
in the fact that you'll be able to
create<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.460> world<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.180> able<00:02:53.270> to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
create this world and we be able to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.480 
create this world and we be able to
really<00:02:54.290> make<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.530> something<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.100> people

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
really make it something that people

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.980 
really make it something that people
care<00:02:55.700> about<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.120> they<00:02:56.180> do<00:02:56.240> care<00:02:56.630> about<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
care about and they do care about the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.030 
care about and they do care about the
more<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.380> they<00:02:57.440> do<00:02:57.500> care<00:02:57.770> about<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
more and they do care about the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
really that excitement I think when

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.380 
really that excitement I think when
people<00:03:45.530> pick<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.130> Cataclysm<00:03:46.910> they<00:03:47.120> really

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
people pick up Cataclysm they really

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.630 
people pick up Cataclysm they really
need<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.630> decide<00:03:47.989> what<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.310> they<00:03:49.610> want

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
need to decide what it is that they want

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.190 
need to decide what it is that they want
to<00:03:49.850> play<00:03:49.940> first<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.660> where<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.930> want<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.140> go

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
to play first and where they want to go

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.140 
to play first and where they want to go
with<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.800> think<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.400> lot<00:03:52.580> of<00:03:52.610> players<00:03:52.850> are

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
with it I think a lot of players are

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.340 
with it I think a lot of players are
probably<00:03:53.360> gonna<00:03:53.480> take<00:03:53.690> their<00:03:53.840> existing

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
probably gonna take their existing

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.870 
probably gonna take their existing
character<00:03:54.739> immediately<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.370> level<00:03:55.700> cap

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
character immediately to the level cap

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280 
character immediately to the level cap
