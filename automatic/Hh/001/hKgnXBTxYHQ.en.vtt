00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.609 

it's<00:01:16.060> pretty<00:01:16.299> believable<00:01:16.539> yeah<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.500> know

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
it's pretty believable yeah you know

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.459 
it's pretty believable yeah you know
that's<00:01:17.799> that's<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.100> real<00:01:18.460> cool<00:01:18.729> tone<00:01:19.320> channel<00:01:20.320> 1

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
that's that's a real cool tone channel 1

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:56.620 
that's that's a real cool tone channel 1
and<00:01:20.799> channel<00:01:21.430> 2<00:01:21.789> or<00:01:21.969> Drive<00:01:22.420> one

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.450 

it's<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> usable<00:01:58.170> game<00:01:58.380> there<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> 30

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.639 

real<00:02:05.460> big<00:02:05.670> difference<00:02:05.789> really<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.359> uh<00:02:06.649> there's

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
real big difference really is uh there's

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
real big difference really is uh there's
no<00:02:07.770> middle<00:02:08.129> controlling<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
no middle controlling so it's just

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960 
no middle controlling so it's just
treble<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:09.959> bass<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:11.160> share<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> same<00:02:11.549> book

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
treble and bass you share the same book

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.270 
treble and bass you share the same book
this<00:02:12.840> will<00:02:13.049> have<00:02:13.170> travel<00:02:13.530> middle<00:02:13.799> base<00:02:13.980> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
this will have travel middle base and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.110 
this will have travel middle base and
the<00:02:15.120> same<00:02:15.330> features<00:02:15.720> normal
