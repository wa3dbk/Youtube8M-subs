00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
many years ago but there's been a very

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580

all four records in progression because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299

that's kind of the development of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
that's kind of the development of
popular<00:00:53.850> rock<00:00:54.180> based<00:00:54.449> psychedelic<00:00:55.110> music<00:00:55.230> but

creative musical limits and that makes
for<00:01:47.460> an<00:01:47.579> amazing<00:01:47.729> album<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> key<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
for an amazing album but the key is that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960
