hey everyone this is Fernando during our
video<00:00:03.090> for<00:00:03.360> more<00:00:03.389> survivalist<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.470> case

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
video for more survivalist in this case

video for more survivalist in this case
top<00:00:05.220> three<00:00:05.580> improvised<00:00:06.359> weapons<00:00:06.930> let's<00:00:07.379> start

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
top three improvised weapons let's start

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.860 
top three improvised weapons let's start
with<00:00:07.770> number<00:00:07.950> three<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.730> hammer<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.570> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
with number three the hammer it is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.160 
with number three the hammer it is
pretty<00:00:10.200> effective<00:00:10.320> even<00:00:11.040> though<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.550> other

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
pretty effective even though like other

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
pretty effective even though like other
blunt<00:00:13.170> weapons<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.040> has<00:00:14.309> certain<00:00:15.059> limitations

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
blunt weapons it has certain limitations

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
blunt weapons it has certain limitations
basically<00:00:16.289> three<00:00:16.680> limitations<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
basically three limitations that you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 
basically three limitations that you
could<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.050> common<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> other

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
could think of and in common to other

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
could think of and in common to other
weapons<00:00:19.920> such<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.279> baseball<00:00:20.910> bats<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> sticks

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
weapons such as baseball bats and sticks

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
weapons such as baseball bats and sticks
and<00:00:22.109> such<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.740> depends<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.150> amount

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and such it depends a lot on the amount

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.839 
and such it depends a lot on the amount
of<00:00:24.420> room<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.560> swing<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
of room you have to swing it so as to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
of room you have to swing it so as to
perform<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> blunt-trauma<00:00:28.590> gaming

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
perform that a blunt-trauma gaming

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.630 
perform that a blunt-trauma gaming
gaining<00:00:29.699> momentum<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.489> something<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
gaining momentum so it is something that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.030 
gaining momentum so it is something that
may<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.360> convenient<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.440> ranges

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
may not be as convenient when it ranges

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950 
may not be as convenient when it ranges
are<00:00:35.190> much<00:00:35.370> shorter<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:35.940> someone<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.540> top<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
are much shorter or someone is on top of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
are much shorter or someone is on top of
you<00:00:37.110> struggling<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.829> such<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.489> need<00:00:38.730> room<00:00:39.030> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you struggling and such you need room so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.470 
you struggling and such you need room so
as<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.930> wield<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.379> effectively<00:00:40.950> number<00:00:41.820> two<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
as to wield it effectively number two it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
as to wield it effectively number two it
is<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.500> something<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> will<00:00:44.160> depend<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.670> lot

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
is is something that will depend a lot

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
is is something that will depend a lot
on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> strength<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.170> person<00:00:46.559> using<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
on the strength of the person using it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160 
on the strength of the person using it
and<00:00:47.190> we're<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.760> equally<00:00:48.239> strong<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.930> people

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and we're not equally strong some people

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
and we're not equally strong some people
are<00:00:49.289> weaker<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:49.829> our<00:00:50.010> smaller<00:00:50.430> frames<00:00:50.879> maybe

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
are weaker than our smaller frames maybe

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
are weaker than our smaller frames maybe
because<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> age<00:00:52.199> maybe<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
because of age maybe because of some in

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.410 
because of age maybe because of some in
a<00:00:55.219> condition<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.030> strength

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a condition that they have so strength

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
a condition that they have so strength
is<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.350> depending<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.039> how

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is going to be depending on how

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.910 
is going to be depending on how
effective<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.390> finally<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
effective this is and finally it has to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.549 
effective this is and finally it has to
be<00:01:02.070> used<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> certain<00:01:03.120> degree<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
be used with a certain degree of

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
be used with a certain degree of
accuracy<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.180> attacker<00:01:06.510> coming

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
accuracy if you have an attacker coming

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230 
accuracy if you have an attacker coming
at<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.500> his<00:01:07.950> hands<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.760> its<00:01:08.909> arms

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
up and you're you're swinging at him and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
up and you're you're swinging at him and
you're<00:01:11.970> hitting<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> awkward<00:01:12.900> angles<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you're hitting in awkward angles it's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
you're hitting in awkward angles it's
not<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.549> effective<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.479> depends

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
not going to be as effective it depends

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.649 
not going to be as effective it depends
on<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.409> hitting<00:01:16.680> softer<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.659> softer

areas<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:19.799> effective<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.369> harder

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
areas will not be as effective as harder

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.630 
areas will not be as effective as harder
ones<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.869> course<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.320> skull<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
ones of course the skull will be the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
ones of course the skull will be the
best<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.119> place<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> hit<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> hammer<00:01:25.560> which

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
best a place to hit with a hammer which

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
best a place to hit with a hammer which
is<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> pretty<00:01:26.970> much<00:01:27.090> endgame<00:01:27.689> for

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
is going to be pretty much endgame for

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
is going to be pretty much endgame for
you<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.369> hit<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.299> these

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you if you hit get hit with one of these

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.289 
you if you hit get hit with one of these
in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> skull<00:01:30.990> number<00:01:31.829> two<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:33.030> things

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
in the skull number two and here things

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
in the skull number two and here things
get<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.869> better<00:01:34.049> we're<00:01:34.619> talking

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
get a little bit better we're talking

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
get a little bit better we're talking
about<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> hatchet<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.600> don't<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> one

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
about the hatchet if you don't have one

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690 
about the hatchet if you don't have one
of<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> they're<00:01:37.979> still<00:01:38.220> available<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of these and they're still available in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
of these and they're still available in
most<00:01:38.850> grocery<00:01:39.060> stores<00:01:39.450> hardware<00:01:40.049> stores

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
most grocery stores hardware stores

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.160 
most grocery stores hardware stores
they're<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> place<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.630> hatchet

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
they're all over a place and the hatchet

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920 
they're all over a place and the hatchet
now<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> something<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.659> more

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
now is it is something that's more

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
now is it is something that's more
effective<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.979> side<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.000> blunt

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
effective you have one side for blunt
