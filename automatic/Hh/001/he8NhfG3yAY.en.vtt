00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
valuable training tool it is this is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
valuable training tool it is this is
only<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> demonstration<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> training

actual emergency
air<00:00:47.460> monitoring<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> utmost

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
air monitoring would be of the utmost

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
air monitoring would be of the utmost
importance<00:00:50.010> let's<00:00:50.879> start<00:00:51.239> by<00:00:51.480> describing<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
importance let's start by describing the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
importance let's start by describing the
basic<00:00:52.350> features<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> simulator<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
basic features of the simulator so you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
basic features of the simulator so you
can<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> better<00:00:54.930> feeling<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.949> can

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
can get a better feeling for what it can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.279 
can get a better feeling for what it can
do<00:00:56.340> beginning<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> simulator<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
do beginning with a simulator in the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
do beginning with a simulator in the
upright<00:00:58.710> position<00:00:58.739> I'd<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> start<00:01:00.359> with

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
upright position I'd like to start with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
upright position I'd like to start with

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
system can fail and what you and your

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340 
system can fail and what you and your
team<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.159> prevent<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.729> spill<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> far<00:01:25.170> we

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
team can do to prevent a spill so far we

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.170 
team can do to prevent a spill so far we
have<00:01:25.470> talked<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.890> systems<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.030> would

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
have talked about systems that you would

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
have talked about systems that you would
find<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:27.990> MC<00:01:28.549> 306<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:30.020> 406<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.740> next<00:01:32.040> thing

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
find on an MC 306 or 406 the next thing

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
find on an MC 306 or 406 the next thing
you<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> 3-inch<00:01:33.600> clean-out<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you will see is a 3-inch clean-out this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
you will see is a 3-inch clean-out this
is<00:01:35.159> something<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.909> find<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> chemical

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is something you will find on a chemical

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
is something you will find on a chemical
truck<00:01:37.140> such<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.740> an<00:01:37.890> MC<00:01:38.540> 307<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.900> 407<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.369> not
