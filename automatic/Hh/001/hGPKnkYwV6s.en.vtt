00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
a large form factor drive version that

has 12 large form factor drives each of
those<00:02:31.700> drives<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.209> be<00:02:32.299> 2<00:02:32.480> terabytes<00:02:32.930> each<00:02:33.140> so

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
those drives can be 2 terabytes each so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.530 
those drives can be 2 terabytes each so
it<00:02:33.530> gives<00:02:33.709> us<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:33.950> total<00:02:34.370> capacity<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.850> 24

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
it gives us a total capacity of 24

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.650 
it gives us a total capacity of 24
terabytes<00:02:35.810> there's<00:02:36.739> also<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.430> small<00:02:38.420> form

we look for an app that runs in a in a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.430 
we look for an app that runs in a in a
rack<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.600> exit<00:03:45.020> 1800<00:03:45.830> s<00:03:46.100> B<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:46.460> it<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.440> based

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
rack is the exit 1800 s B so it is based

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740 
rack is the exit 1800 s B so it is based
on<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.680> blade<00:03:49.010> system<00:03:49.490> server<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.360> this<00:03:50.480> one<00:03:50.660> is

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
on a blade system server so this one is

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.080 
on a blade system server so this one is
within<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.080> blade<00:03:51.260> system<00:03:51.650> chassis<00:03:52.040> uses<00:03:52.940> our

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
within the blade system chassis uses our

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.110 
within the blade system chassis uses our
SP<00:03:53.570> 40<00:03:54.020> C<00:03:54.290> storage<00:03:54.740> blade<00:03:55.070> is<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.340> storage<00:03:55.820> for

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
SP 40 C storage blade is the storage for

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.410 
SP 40 C storage blade is the storage for
it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.090 
it
so<00:03:57.080> this<00:03:57.200> basically<00:03:57.530> gives<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.860> ability

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
so this basically gives you the ability

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.550 
so this basically gives you the ability
of<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.550> unified<00:03:59.270> storage<00:03:59.690> system<00:04:00.140> within<00:04:00.350> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
of the unified storage system within the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.590 
of the unified storage system within the
blade<00:04:00.770> system<00:04:01.160> chassis<00:04:01.580> there's<00:04:02.150> also<00:04:02.330> an

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
blade system chassis there's also an

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.080 
blade system chassis there's also an
Enterprise<00:04:03.050> Edition<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.710> a<00:04:04.090> software

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
Enterprise Edition that a software

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.370 
Enterprise Edition that a software
version<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.450> runs<00:04:05.480> on<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.900> giving<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.350> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
version that runs on it giving you a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.510 
version that runs on it giving you a
gateway<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.820> X<00:04:08.050> 3800<00:04:09.080> SB<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.400> we've

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
gateway that is the X 3800 SB so we've

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.010 
gateway that is the X 3800 SB so we've
got<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:10.790> more<00:04:10.910> product<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.330> show<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.870> for
