weird so I took the grease gun started
using<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.490> grease<00:01:19.730> my<00:01:19.760> bucket<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.050> I

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
using it to grease my bucket and I

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.920 
using it to grease my bucket and I
noticed<00:01:22.160> on<00:01:22.340> one<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:22.970> fittings<00:01:23.330> some

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
noticed on one of the fittings some

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.480 
noticed on one of the fittings some
grease<00:01:24.170> was<00:01:24.380> kind<00:01:24.620> of<00:01:24.680> puking<00:01:24.980> out<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.280> side

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
and it was copper colored grease and I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.940 
and it was copper colored grease and I
