00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.110 

okay<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.740> step<00:00:08.130> isn't<00:00:08.309> really<00:00:08.610> necessary

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
okay so this step isn't really necessary

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.910 
okay so this step isn't really necessary
but<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.420> use<00:00:09.750> Sigma's<00:00:10.230> eyeshadow<00:00:10.650> base<00:00:10.860> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
but I use Sigma's eyeshadow base and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.780 
but I use Sigma's eyeshadow base and
persuade<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.750> even<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.280> my<00:00:14.280> eyelids

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
persuade to just to even out my eyelids

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.790 
persuade to just to even out my eyelids
because<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:15.929> darkness<00:00:16.560> there

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
because I do have some darkness there

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.769 
because I do have some darkness there
and<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.490> since<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.150> kind<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and it's a since it's kind of like a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.939 
and it's a since it's kind of like a
pink<00:00:19.140> tone<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.310> really<00:00:20.670> helps<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> reduce<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
pink tone it really helps to reduce that

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
pink tone it really helps to reduce that
then<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.100> taking<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.519> dark<00:00:23.880> Obama<00:00:24.300> color<00:00:24.660> by

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
then I'm taking this dark Obama color by

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
then I'm taking this dark Obama color by
motives<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.800> called<00:00:25.980> vino<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
motives I think it's called vino and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
motives I think it's called vino and
with<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:27.029> Sigma<00:00:27.390> e25<00:00:27.750> blending<00:00:28.470> brush<00:00:28.920> I'm

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
with my Sigma e25 blending brush I'm

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.470 
with my Sigma e25 blending brush I'm
just<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> apply<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> crease

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
just going to apply that into the crease

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.380 
just going to apply that into the crease
about<00:00:30.840> halfway<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.940> just<00:00:32.940> blending<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
about halfway and just blending that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.500 
about halfway and just blending that
upwards<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:36.030> doesn't<00:00:36.360> really

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
upwards and out and it doesn't really

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
upwards and out and it doesn't really
have<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.840> perfect<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.410> didn't<00:00:37.710> intend<00:00:38.219> for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
have to be perfect I didn't intend for

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
have to be perfect I didn't intend for
this<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> cut<00:00:39.210> crease<00:00:39.239> type<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.590> but

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this to be a cut crease type of look but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
this to be a cut crease type of look but
it<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.160> turned<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.520> way<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it just turned out that way so it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
it just turned out that way so it
doesn't<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> perfect<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:44.879> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
doesn't have to be perfect because you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
doesn't have to be perfect because you
can<00:00:45.180> always<00:00:45.300> clean<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.870> later<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.590> make

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
can always clean it up later just make

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:56.580 
can always clean it up later just make
sure<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> blend<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.399> top<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.059> good

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.990 

and<00:00:57.590> then<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.740> just<00:00:58.010> take<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.190> separate<00:00:58.580> blending

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
and then I just take a separate blending

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.520 
and then I just take a separate blending
brush<00:00:59.210> just<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.480> make<00:00:59.660> sure<00:00:59.810> there's<00:01:00.050> no<00:01:00.200> harsh

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530

lines<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.190> then<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.790> took<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.180> same<00:01:02.450> blending

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
lines and then I took that same blending

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.049 
lines and then I took that same blending
brush<00:01:03.200> and<00:01:03.410> added<00:01:03.950> a<00:01:04.070> little<00:01:04.220> bit<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.460> Sigma's
