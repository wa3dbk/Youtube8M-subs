in the last week I've finished up

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.049 
in the last week I've finished up
building<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> riverbed<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> putting<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:35.940> of

the<00:00:36.210> rocks<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> other<00:00:37.260> detail<00:00:37.649> into<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the rocks and the other detail into the

the rocks and the other detail into the
bottom<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:39.000> poured<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.829> resin<00:00:40.829> did<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
bottom of it we poured the resin did the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
bottom of it we poured the resin did the
first<00:00:41.910> pour<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.390> Friday<00:00:42.899> last<00:00:43.170> week<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.739> we

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
first pour on Friday last week and we

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160 
first pour on Friday last week and we
started<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.210> week<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> week<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.140> another

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
started the week this week with another

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.279 
started the week this week with another
pour<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.890> give<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.430> depth<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.989> used<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pour to give it some depth but we used a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.260 
pour to give it some depth but we used a
two-part<00:00:49.770> resin<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.280> unreal<00:00:50.700> details

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
two-part resin from unreal details

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
two-part resin from unreal details
called<00:00:51.690> magic<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> nice<00:00:53.070> product

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
called magic water it's a nice product

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.799 
called magic water it's a nice product
we've<00:00:53.610> used<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> before<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.360> other<00:00:54.510> things

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we've used it before for other things

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
we've used it before for other things
but<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> nice<00:00:56.160> smooth<00:00:56.760> glassy<00:00:57.300> surface

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but we have a nice smooth glassy surface

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.139 
but we have a nice smooth glassy surface
now<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> thing<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.680> rivers<00:00:59.670> tend<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
now and the thing is that rivers tend to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.299 
now and the thing is that rivers tend to
have<00:01:00.270> flowing<00:01:00.719> water<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.739> wind<00:01:02.039> effects

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
have flowing water and have wind effects

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.410 
have flowing water and have wind effects
on<00:01:02.489> them<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.730> everything<00:01:02.969> else<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.270> need

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
on them and everything else so we need

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
on them and everything else so we need
to<00:01:03.480> give<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.229> smooth<00:01:04.500> surface<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> little

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to give the the smooth surface a little

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.679 
to give the the smooth surface a little
bit<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> ripple<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.210> want<00:01:06.330> too<00:01:06.510> much

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
bit of a ripple we don't want too much

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.000 
bit of a ripple we don't want too much
for<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.320> we've<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.860> nice

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
for this because we've got all that nice

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.109 
for this because we've got all that nice
detail<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> bottom<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.000> want

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
detail on the bottom we don't want

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.929 
detail on the bottom we don't want
obscure<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.040> anyway<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.159> using<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.549> project

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
obscure but anyway I'm using a project

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.399 
obscure but anyway I'm using a project
called<00:01:12.090> water<00:01:12.420> effects<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.020> woodland

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
called water effects from woodland

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.039 
called water effects from woodland
Scenic's<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> great<00:01:15.270> easy<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> use

me show you how it works the first thing
we'll<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> we'll<00:01:25.409> apply<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
we'll do is we'll apply some of the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
we'll do is we'll apply some of the
water<00:01:26.820> effects<00:01:27.240> directly<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> surface<00:01:28.890> of

water effects directly to the surface of
the<00:01:29.400> water<00:01:29.610> depending<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.780> thick<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the water depending on how thick you

the water depending on how thick you
want<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> waves<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.490> depend<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.790> how

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
want the waves to be will depend on how

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.010 
want the waves to be will depend on how
much<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> use<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> start<00:01:33.930> out

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
much you use we're going to start out

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
much you use we're going to start out
with<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.140> small<00:01:34.350> amount<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.310> next<00:01:35.579> I'm<00:01:35.670> going

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
with a small amount and next I'm going

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
with a small amount and next I'm going
to<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> half<00:01:36.600> inch<00:01:36.810> paint<00:01:37.049> brush<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to take a half inch paint brush and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
to take a half inch paint brush and
we're<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> use<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> stippling

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
we're just going to use a stippling

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.440 
we're just going to use a stippling
motion<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:40.409> start<00:01:40.650> creating<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.280> ripple<00:01:41.610> now

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

motion to start creating a ripple now
because<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> fairly<00:01:43.259> calm<00:01:43.619> partion<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because this is a fairly calm partion of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
because this is a fairly calm partion of
the<00:01:44.250> river<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.360> heck<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.840> lot

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the river I don't want a heck of a lot

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.760 
the river I don't want a heck of a lot
of<00:01:46.049> waves<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.770> stipple

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of waves on it so we're going to stipple

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
of waves on it so we're going to stipple
this<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.399> until<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> waves<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.540> fairly

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
this down until the waves are fairly

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.609 
this down until the waves are fairly
small<00:01:52.490> but<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.759> were<00:01:53.909> working<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.930> harbour

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
small but if I were working on a harbour

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.649 
small but if I were working on a harbour
scene<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.399> probably<00:01:56.850> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> apply

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
scene you probably need to apply

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
scene you probably need to apply
multiple<00:01:58.409> layers<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.009> material<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
multiple layers of this material and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
multiple layers of this material and
rather<00:01:59.850> thickly<00:02:00.180> too<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.719> order<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
rather thickly too in order to get the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
rather thickly too in order to get the
types<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.399> waves<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.909> would<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.270> more

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
types of waves that would be more

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
types of waves that would be more
appropriate<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.399> alright<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> product

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
appropriate for that alright the product

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
appropriate for that alright the product
goes<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.210> white<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.840> dry<00:02:06.990> nice<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
goes on white but it will dry nice and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
goes on white but it will dry nice and
clear<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.610> couple<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.940> hours<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.390> then

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
clear in a couple of hours and then

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
clear in a couple of hours and then
we'll<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.080> able<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:11.069> type<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> ripple

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
we'll be able to see what type of ripple

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
we'll be able to see what type of ripple
effect<00:02:12.360> we've<00:02:12.569> wound<00:02:12.780> up<00:02:12.989> with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
effect we've wound up with

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
effect we've wound up with
I've<00:02:13.650> done<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.160> portion<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.670> I'm

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
I've done this little portion here I'm

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.250 
I've done this little portion here I'm
going<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.910> continue<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.630> other<00:02:15.810> side<00:02:15.900> but

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
going to continue on this other side but

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.810 
going to continue on this other side but
let<00:02:16.680> me<00:02:16.770> show<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> some<00:02:17.250> other<00:02:17.310> things<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
let me show you some other things you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.250 
let me show you some other things you
can<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.360> I've<00:02:18.510> got<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.690> rapid<00:02:19.170> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
can do with this I've got a rapid that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
can do with this I've got a rapid that
I'm<00:02:19.380> working<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> around<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> corner

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I'm working on on the around the corner

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.140 
I'm working on on the around the corner
here<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.840> river<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:22.380> go<00:02:22.530> over<00:02:22.710> there

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
here on the river so let's go over there

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180 
here on the river so let's go over there
on<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.360> part<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.720> river<00:02:24.870> here<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.530> had<00:02:25.890> two

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
on this part of the river here I had two

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490 
on this part of the river here I had two
layers<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.690> magic<00:02:27.690> water<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.080> two<00:02:28.200> different

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
layers of magic water at two different

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.020 
layers of magic water at two different
heights<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.610> end<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
heights because actually this end of the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.120 
heights because actually this end of the
layout<00:02:30.300> over<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.930> higher<00:02:31.260> than<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.860> end

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
layout over here is higher than that end

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.010 
layout over here is higher than that end
and<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.550> since<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.360> self<00:02:33.570> leveling

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
and so since it's a self leveling

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.110 
and so since it's a self leveling
product<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.560> needed<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> keep<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.060> that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
product we needed to keep it on that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.880 
product we needed to keep it on that
side<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.900> had<00:02:36.990> built<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.260> small<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.710> dam

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
side so we had built a small little dam

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.210 
side so we had built a small little dam
out<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.190> caulk<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.570> now<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.220> material

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
out of caulk and now that the material

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920 
out of caulk and now that the material
is<00:02:41.340> dry<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.580> either<00:02:41.820> side<00:02:42.150> we're<00:02:42.420> actually

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
is dry on either side we're actually

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
is dry on either side we're actually
disguising<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.010> lip<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.880> look<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.300> a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
disguising the lip here to look like a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860 
disguising the lip here to look like a
Rapids<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> what<00:02:47.040> I'll<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.610> put<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.570> another

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
Rapids so what I'll do is put in another

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
Rapids so what I'll do is put in another
layer<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.410> water<00:02:50.280> effects<00:02:51.590> right<00:02:52.590> along<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
layer of water effects right along the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.550 
layer of water effects right along the
edge<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.690> I'll<00:02:54.810> use<00:02:54.990> my<00:02:55.020> paintbrush

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
edge and then I'll use my paintbrush

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.910 
edge and then I'll use my paintbrush
just<00:02:56.780> carefully<00:02:57.780> shape<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.260> into<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.590> space

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
just carefully shape it into the space

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.950 
just carefully shape it into the space
here<00:02:59.280> make<00:02:59.910> it<00:02:59.940> look<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.570> water<00:03:00.720> is

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
here make it look like the water is

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.440 
here make it look like the water is
pouring<00:03:01.290> over<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.740> rocks<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.730> pieces<00:03:03.300> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
pouring over the rocks and the pieces of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.360 
pouring over the rocks and the pieces of
wood<00:03:03.630> here<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.020> are<00:03:04.290> hanging<00:03:04.830> out<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
wood here that are hanging out of the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.140 
wood here that are hanging out of the
side<00:03:05.690> again<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:06.870> will<00:03:07.080> all<00:03:07.260> dry<00:03:08.160> into<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> nice

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
side again this will all dry into a nice

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
side again this will all dry into a nice
clear<00:03:09.600> consistency<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.740> case<00:03:11.010> we're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
clear consistency but in this case we're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.980 
clear consistency but in this case we're
going<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.640> probably<00:03:12.000> want<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.360> take<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.780> paint

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
going to probably want to take and paint

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.200 
going to probably want to take and paint
it<00:03:13.110> with<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.440> white<00:03:13.620> paint

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
it with a little white paint

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.610 
it with a little white paint
give<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.330> some<00:03:15.450> white<00:03:15.690> caps<00:03:16.020> make<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.500> look

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
give it some white caps make it look

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.400 
give it some white caps make it look
like<00:03:16.770> white<00:03:17.010> water<00:03:17.990> all<00:03:18.990> right<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.320> looks

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
like white water all right that looks

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.650 
like white water all right that looks
pretty<00:03:19.530> good<00:03:19.710> we'll<00:03:19.950> let<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.190> dry<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.790> we'll

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
pretty good we'll let that dry and we'll

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.210 
pretty good we'll let that dry and we'll
evaluate<00:03:21.900> whether<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.500> need<00:03:22.650> one<00:03:22.830> more<00:03:22.860> layer

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
evaluate whether we need one more layer

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040 
evaluate whether we need one more layer
or<00:03:23.340> not<00:03:23.490> but<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> think<00:03:23.790> we're<00:03:24.180> pretty<00:03:24.720> close<00:03:24.990> to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
or not but I think we're pretty close to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.020 
or not but I think we're pretty close to
being<00:03:25.410> there<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:26.250> other<00:03:26.370> thing<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:26.910> do

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
being there one other thing you can do

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.460 
being there one other thing you can do
with<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.270> water<00:03:27.450> effects<00:03:27.780> material<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.380> you

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
with the water effects material is you

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.890 
with the water effects material is you
can<00:03:28.590> make<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:28.830> look<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.160> trails<00:03:29.910> where<00:03:30.390> there

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
can make it look like trails where there

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.240 
can make it look like trails where there
may<00:03:31.050> be<00:03:31.080> something<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.680> below<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.070> surface

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
may be something just below the surface

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490 
may be something just below the surface
of<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.580> water<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.030> has<00:03:33.150> created<00:03:33.600> ripples<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
of the water that has created ripples so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.840 
of the water that has created ripples so
here<00:03:34.650> we<00:03:34.770> have<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> little<00:03:35.100> rock<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.640> just

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
here we have a little rock that's just

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.980 
here we have a little rock that's just
below<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.210> surface<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> water<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:36.900> you

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
below the surface of the water and you

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.390 
below the surface of the water and you
can<00:03:37.050> see<00:03:37.170> we've<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.920> used<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.220> water

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
can see we've just used the water

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.160 
can see we've just used the water
