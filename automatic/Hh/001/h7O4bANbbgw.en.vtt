00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.250
Hey guys Asus India today released their brand
new Asus Zenfone 2.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.150
So this is the premium of the two the ZE551ML
to be precise.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.570
Now we already did quick overview of this.
You can check those out with did some Benchmark

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.650
testing and game play's and all.
In this particular video we will mainly focus

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.910
on the brilliant Pixel master camera of this
one.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.750
Now the pixel master camera came previously.
But this one is called pixel master technology

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.710
2.0 and as the name suggest.
It kind of upgrades over the previous technology.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.379
Now both variants of Zenfone 2 comes with
13MP back camera and 5MP front camera.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.129
Both have pixel master technologies.
Now what pixel master does is it's kind of

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.219
gives you the extra edge or at least Asus
promises in low light over extra details.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:58.679
Now this is much brighter and it kind of captures
up to 400% brighter photos and videos at night.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.859
At least it's supposed to now when flash is
preferred you would see you should see true

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.710
tone because of that dual LED Flash on the
back.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.140
And apart from that there are also some other
things.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.010
For example the front 5MP camera has a good
enough field of view about 85% which is not

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.580
exactly super wide.
But we can see that's roughly wide roughly

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.180
about 28 or 27mm lens on a 35mm camera would
give you.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.980
It also has the usual shooting modes like
HDR modes and you know all these other things.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.770
Also comes with a BSI sensor which is back
side illuminated sensor.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.000
Which meaning that it gives you that added.
It kind of checks the noise even at high ISO

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
you know sensitivity.
Now let's quickly take a look at UI.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.660
It looks very clean at the start because it's
in auto and you can go and straight away start

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.860
firing.
It's not absolutely zero lag yeah.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.891
And it also has a fair amount of buffer time.
And then you can start recording there you

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:07.909
can pause it if you wanna keep the same file
or you can stop it right from there.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.120
And you can also take stills.
There is slight lag in the operations manly

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.042
and that's the front camera.
You can see it looks quite bright and it also

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:22.900
has kind of those beautification and other
stuffs there.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.230
So the front camera has this many shooting
modes your beautification and then selfife

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.730
panorama cool.
Then HDR and low light which is the pixel

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.891
master technology.
But when you go to the 13MP rear camera you

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:42.480
will have much more shooting options there.
Yeah I am gonna give you demo of this in detail

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.560
when this device comes to our lab for full
review.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.819
But there should be quite cool.
Now we gonna go to the settings and see that's

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.910
the camera settings.
So white balance you can set up the white

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.200
balance.
The ISO and I don't know what this optimization

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.400
means.
But camera resolution and 4*3 you can have

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.459
13MP otherwise if you wanna shoot wide screen
you will have to go down 10MP and then you

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.180
have anti shakes enhancements which should
meaning stabilization and then face detection

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.680
and video quality full HD and video preference.
Some of the other things those comes to video

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.140
and as you scroll down it automatically actually
transfers to the video menu there.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.680
This is another cool thing that again goes
this particular menu which has kind of some

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.930
of those camera usual camera system settings,
Yeah.
