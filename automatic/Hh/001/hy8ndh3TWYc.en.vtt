memory tap as you probably seen on above

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.950 
memory tap as you probably seen on above
as<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.260> title<00:00:10.500> there<00:00:11.570> because<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.719> clicked

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
on this video obviously you can see here

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870 
on this video obviously you can see here
what<00:00:15.509> I'm<00:00:15.599> using<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.139> shrink<00:00:16.880> shrinks

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
what I'm using here is shrink shrinks

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.370 
what I'm using here is shrink shrinks
your<00:00:18.710> icons<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:21.210> anything<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.199> want

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
your icons to about to anything you want

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
your icons to about to anything you want
which<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> good<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.279> you're<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.050> five

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
which is good if you're using the five

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.890 
which is good if you're using the five
icon<00:00:25.410> dock<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.330> five<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
icon dock and like the five or a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
icon dock and like the five or a
springboard<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.800> 5.com<00:00:29.640> that'll<00:00:30.210> deal

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
springboard and that 5.com that'll deal

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.030 
springboard and that 5.com that'll deal
I<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.560> looks<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.859> better

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
I just think it looks a little better

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.830 
I just think it looks a little better
like<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.000> spreads<00:00:33.329> Medal<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like this because it spreads Medal of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.610 
like this because it spreads Medal of
war<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.380> called

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
war but so this is going to be called

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.520 
war but so this is going to be called
memory<00:00:38.489> tap<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.090> memory<00:00:39.390> tap<00:00:39.600> freeze<00:00:40.110> your

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
memory tap now memory tap freeze your

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
memory tap now memory tap freeze your
memory<00:00:41.250> freeze<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.030> memory<00:00:42.420> processes

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
memory freeze your memory processes

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
memory freeze your memory processes
super<00:00:43.440> simply<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.820> go

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
super simply so you don't have to go

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.040 
super simply so you don't have to go
into<00:00:45.680> sbsettings<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.340> find<00:00:47.930> your<00:00:51.050> find

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
into sbsettings and then find your find

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
into sbsettings and then find your find
your<00:00:52.350> processes<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.399> above<00:00:53.699> fifth

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
your processes and if it's above fifth

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
your processes and if it's above fifth
it's<00:00:54.629> above<00:00:54.870> 50<00:00:55.289> megabytes<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> can't<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.309> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's above 50 megabytes you can't do it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's above 50 megabytes you can't do it
and<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.620> probably<00:00:58.890> not

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and so I don't know it's probably not

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.240 
and so I don't know it's probably not
safe<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> still<00:01:01.920> does<00:01:02.070> your

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
safe but I I think it still does your

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
safe but I I think it still does your
job<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
job so for me you can see here I just

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.380 
job so for me you can see here I just
you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.740> enable<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.670> activator<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you can you can enable with activator to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
you can you can enable with activator to
anywhere<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.890> hold<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
anywhere you want I just hold down the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
anywhere you want I just hold down the
top<00:01:12.869> whole<00:01:13.140> thing<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.619> tops<00:01:13.920> power<00:01:14.340> button

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
top whole thing here tops power button

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120 
top whole thing here tops power button
hold<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.840> me<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.979> note

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
hold that down for me and then note

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
hold that down for me and then note
you'll<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> free<00:01:17.670> memory<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.420> right

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you'll get a free memory thing right

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.350 
you'll get a free memory thing right
like<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:20.369> obviously<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> moves<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> ton

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
like this but obviously it moves a ton

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
like this but obviously it moves a ton
easier<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.920> memory<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.759> be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
easier and then your memory will be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780 
easier and then your memory will be
freed<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.750> um<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.590> don't<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> give<00:01:26.490> away<00:01:26.549> my

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
freed so um I don't want to give away my

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030 
freed so um I don't want to give away my
IP<00:01:26.939> address<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
IP address and it's kind of that but I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
IP address and it's kind of that but I
can<00:01:29.729> tell<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.810> freed<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
can tell you that it will be freed and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
can tell you that it will be freed and
it's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.810> like

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it's a lot you can see here I can like

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's a lot you can see here I can like
already<00:01:34.439> scroll<00:01:34.740> across<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.090> cool

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
already scroll across and the cool

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240 
already scroll across and the cool
because<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.590> don't<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> know<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.100> it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
because them you don't you know if it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
because them you don't you know if it's
like<00:01:38.430> frozen<00:01:38.909> rot<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.200> doing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
like frozen rot because what I'm doing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.149 
like frozen rot because what I'm doing
this<00:01:41.750> obviously<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> VMT<00:01:43.470> screen

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
this obviously with the VMT screen

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
this obviously with the VMT screen
splitter<00:01:44.460> thing<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> ton<00:01:45.180> more<00:01:45.479> laggy<00:01:46.049> r

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
splitter thing it's a ton more laggy r

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.010 
splitter thing it's a ton more laggy r
but<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.369> smoothly<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.869> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
but this was really smoothly and this is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.310 
but this was really smoothly and this is
my<00:01:49.170> lime-green<00:01:49.759> progress<00:01:50.759> gear<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
my lime-green progress gear and so you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.899 
my lime-green progress gear and so you
for<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> guys<00:01:52.920> it'll<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> spinning

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
for you guys it'll just be a spinning

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.440 
for you guys it'll just be a spinning
little<00:01:54.240> pin<00:01:55.110> pin<00:01:55.829> wheel<00:01:56.009> type<00:01:56.250> deal<00:01:56.460> oh<00:01:56.670> yeah

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
little pin pin wheel type deal oh yeah

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.899 
little pin pin wheel type deal oh yeah
and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.659> figured<00:01:57.930> out<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.110> um<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.670> there's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and I figured out that um a lot there's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I figured out that um a lot there's
just<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.180> guy<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.689> he<00:02:00.780> does<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
just one guy think that he does a lot of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780 
just one guy think that he does a lot of
these<00:02:01.380> type<00:02:01.649> things<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.430> he<00:02:02.520> calls<00:02:02.670> them

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
these type things but he calls them

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.149 
these type things but he calls them
loaders<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:05.130> should

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
loaders I really don't think they should

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.550 
loaders I really don't think they should
be<00:02:05.430> called<00:02:05.640> loaders<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.200> make

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
be called loaders when you actually make

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
be called loaders when you actually make
them<00:02:07.740> there<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> file<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.599> as

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
them there in the file you make them as

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
them there in the file you make them as
is<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> progress<00:02:10.619> gear<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> thought

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
is like a progress gear so I thought

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.040 
is like a progress gear so I thought
that<00:02:12.390> makes

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that makes

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.020 
that makes
and<00:02:13.440> when<00:02:13.800> he<00:02:13.890> searched<00:02:14.100> progress<00:02:14.670> Gareth's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
and when he searched progress Gareth's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.370 
and when he searched progress Gareth's
the<00:02:15.120> only<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.510> get<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.350> reason

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the only one to get so that's the reason

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
the only one to get so that's the reason
I<00:02:16.770> was<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.130> confused<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.700> because<00:02:18.510> I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
I was a little confused there because I

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.210 
I was a little confused there because I
was<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.020> wise<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.740> other<00:02:19.830> people<00:02:20.100> doing

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
was like wise and other people doing

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.190 
was like wise and other people doing
this<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.820> then<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> realized<00:02:21.630> other<00:02:21.930> people

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
this and then I realized other people

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.970 
this and then I realized other people

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
to make memory tap go on memory tap will

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.920 
to make memory tap go on memory tap will
free<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.760> virtual<00:03:57.060> memory<00:03:57.270> if<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.660> didn't

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
free the virtual memory if I didn't

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.440 
free the virtual memory if I didn't
clear<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.290> up<00:03:58.790> it's<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.030> free<00:04:00.300> the

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
virtual memory and it works with the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.080 
virtual memory and it works with the
like<00:04:03.920> my<00:04:04.920> other<00:04:05.010> videos<00:04:05.430> were<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.700> free<00:04:05.880> more

memory and I'm not totally sure if it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.810 
memory and I'm not totally sure if it
works<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.890> one<00:04:11.010> with<00:04:11.190> Cydia<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.670> the
