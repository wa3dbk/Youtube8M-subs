we<00:00:02.730> could<00:00:02.879> see<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.240> dust<00:00:03.419> come<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:03.899> on<00:00:04.170> the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
we could see the dust come in on the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.380 
we could see the dust come in on the
gust<00:00:04.710> front<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.250> head<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.490> spring<00:00:05.759> storms

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.179 
gust front of the head of spring storms
when<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.960> winds<00:00:07.200> blow<00:00:07.350> out<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> southwest

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
when the winds blow out of the southwest

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.709 
when the winds blow out of the southwest
and<00:00:08.429> they<00:00:08.580> bring<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> dust<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
and they bring the dust out of the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.209 
and they bring the dust out of the
desert<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.260> see<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.530> come<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> air

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
desert we can see it come in on the air

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.700 
desert we can see it come in on the air
and<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.300> readily<00:00:12.870> observed<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
and then it's readily observed on the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.750 
and then it's readily observed on the
snowpack<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.700> snow<00:00:14.910> turns<00:00:15.389> red<00:00:16.080> turns<00:00:16.800> red<00:00:17.580> or

snowpack the snow turns red turns red or

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.370 
snowpack the snow turns red turns red or
brown<00:00:17.940> depending<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> source<00:00:18.810> area<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
brown depending on the source area and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.890 
brown depending on the source area and
it's<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.400> easy<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> dust<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.570> top<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
it's it's easy to see the dust on top of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.210 
it's it's easy to see the dust on top of
the<00:00:21.960> snow<00:00:23.269> in<00:00:24.269> our<00:00:24.420> field<00:00:24.810> observations<00:00:25.529> we've

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the snow in our field observations we've

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
the snow in our field observations we've
seen<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> effects<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> dust<00:00:27.560> melting<00:00:28.560> snow

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
seen the effects of dust melting snow

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.440 
seen the effects of dust melting snow
faster<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:30.420> we've<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.859> previous<00:00:32.820> work<00:00:33.059> shown

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
faster and we've in previous work shown

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200 
faster and we've in previous work shown
that<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.290> dust<00:00:34.980> causes<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> snowpack<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that that dust causes the snowpack to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
that that dust causes the snowpack to
melt<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> month<00:00:37.110> early<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:38.520> next

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
melt out about a month early so our next

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
melt out about a month early so our next
question<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.200> happens

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
question was well what happens

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
question was well what happens
basin-wide<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.570> what<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> effects<00:00:43.020> on

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
basin-wide and what are the effects on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
basin-wide and what are the effects on
runoff<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> Colorado<00:00:44.100> River<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
runoff in the Colorado River so the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
runoff in the Colorado River so the
Colorado<00:00:45.960> River<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> lifeblood<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730

think that there's the opportunity to
potentially<00:02:32.079> recover<00:02:32.829> some<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.549> loss<00:02:33.790> in

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
potentially recover some of the loss in

think this study gives us some hints
that<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.989> could<00:02:44.169> lose<00:02:44.409> yet<00:02:44.709> even<00:02:45.069> more<00:02:45.459> water

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
that we could lose yet even more water

that we could lose yet even more water
if<00:02:46.150> we're<00:02:46.389> not<00:02:46.540> careful<00:02:47.069> about<00:02:48.069> how<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:48.370> manage
