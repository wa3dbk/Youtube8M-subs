00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
the gems and then I detached all the
jump<00:01:15.090> rings<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.390> were<00:01:15.570> connecting<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> gems

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
jump rings that were connecting the gems

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.609 
jump rings that were connecting the gems
together<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.869> noticed<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.380> halfway

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
together and I noticed about halfway

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
together and I noticed about halfway
through<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.670> metal<00:01:21.000> jump<00:01:21.360> rings<00:01:21.630> were

through that the metal jump rings were

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
through that the metal jump rings were
like<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.560> weak<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.130> could<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:23.490> much

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like really weak so I could pretty much

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
like really weak so I could pretty much
just<00:01:23.850> take<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> apart<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.570> hands<00:01:25.049> but

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
just take it apart with my hands but

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
just take it apart with my hands but
really<00:01:25.770> depends<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.729> necklace<00:01:27.150> take

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
really depends on your necklace take

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
really depends on your necklace take
your<00:01:27.960> glue<00:01:28.140> gun<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.860> glue<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.900> piece

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
gems on top of the glue I decided to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
gems on top of the glue I decided to
start<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.540> further<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> few

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
start a little further up like a few

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
start a little further up like a few
inches<00:01:38.369> further<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.140> my

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
inches further up because I know that my

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
inches further up because I know that my
hair<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.860> covering<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.579> bottom

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
hair is going to be covering the bottom

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.420
