00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.000
 and it's already getting a little bit less 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.990
 that your holidays have gone 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.450
 tell me I want to know where you have 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.340
 you have not traveled to think the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.079
 next year where and so write it 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.149
 down there and he tells me jce I want 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.369
 know about you as you had already 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.779
 announced via facebook and I wanted to tell you 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.970
 some changes that had an impact 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.550
 wait is not thinking how 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.370
 to organize myself because even if you believe that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 this of making videos 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.320
 continue with the blog to have the networks 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.359
 social a day is a lot of work 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.309
 It takes a lot of time and I have 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.890
 8 - hour work well apart from 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.559
 this is a total hobby so 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.289
 obviously I had to organize because 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.510
 I do not give I do not carry everything I want 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.449
 make the first change of which I am going to 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.600
 talking is pretty obvious you can see me 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.789
 I've cut my hair a lot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 years not, but I think it 's time 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 that I take the shortest from the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.979
 adolescence 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.439
 so look how long it cuts but I'm 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.250
 very happy I had not dared 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.869
 spent years and years saying this but 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 then I came to the hairdresser and I did not 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.560
 dared thinking that equal mention 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 destruction and I did not like it and had to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 spend the rest of my days like what 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 I wanted a lot more comfortable and now that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 Winter comes and I go for noses 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 because I have a lot of hair 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 as you can see I have a hair area 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.590
 Well, it's going to be great for me because 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 winter I have to dry my hair yes or 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 yes I decided to cut me another of the things 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.700
 new is about social networks in 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.000
 facebook for example I already warned you that I was going 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.920
 to close not the fanpage is like that that's the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.140
 that I'm going to use and the one that you 're going to be 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
 day of everything but I had an account from 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.369
 which wrote the fanpage that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 called szalai since millen is worth this 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.369
 account and you have had me a lot of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 people friendship at the beginning or are all 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.700
 but is not it the sense then 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 I have not closed it but I have reduced it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.740
 completely has no friendships I'm not going 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.510
 to do nothing with her so I do not 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.680
 ask for friendship out there because it is not 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.270
 I'm not going to do anything with her 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.910
 then it would be absurd can I adopt 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.850
 but nothing would happen just I'm going to 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.280
 manage the fanpage which is that it is from 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.170
 Milan letters from a Spanish woman as well 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 something that I want you to understand 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.400
 you are giving me access to 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.550
 your private life to your facebook 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.140
 staff in many of the cases I could 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.970
 have a lot of your things without 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.790
 know or if it does not seem fair to me 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.370
 I wanted to have access to all those photos or 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.410
 all your comments without without knowing them 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.120
 then it seems more just to me to do so 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.880
 if you want to keep in touch with me and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.250
 others to the fanpage that I put you here 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.290
 so that you have it and I 'm still not 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.200
 fans of this page and you want to do it 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.000
 Well, from there, another thing that I've done 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.620
 although I know I do not have time but this 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.840
 will make me more useful and has 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.840
 convinced a lot of people is that 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.690
 open an instagram account if by 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 I have an instagram account in open 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.850
 so you can gossip the things that 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.590
 they are happening in the day to day in Milan 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.480
 I had Instagram account that the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 had totally closed did not have no 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.990
 accepts no follower just used it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.280
 for the filters and then I with those 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.220
 photos because I already did what I wanted 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.320
 but it was not open now 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.900
 when life would have seen that there was a 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.160
 lots of requests from you that I 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.140
 you have found by chance because 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.000
 He had not promoted or publicized 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.650
 no site but you had found it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.250
 then well you're going to detect all 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.860
 and good the account of the little ones but 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.380
 come on let's go grow and let's go 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.990
 to be able to count there little things and you go 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.120
 watching photos of lan and what we do 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.040
 around here and I hope you like it 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.100
 also give the address here in case 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.170
 you want to follow me then there you have it 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.610
 there I leave it another of the things that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.360
 also the ads already had facebook 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.610
 is that I was going to try to update more 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.430
 tell more things because sometimes I 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.050
 it costs to make goodbye videos costs me 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.330
 write post 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.580
 the blog then good this allows me 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.250
 go updating things much faster 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.370
 with instagram and with facebook especially 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.510
 I think that twitter does not use it much 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.750
 priority right now is going to be the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.490
 facebook and instagram and last of the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.190
 things that I want to tell you that it is like this 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.270
 it's super cool he left it to the end 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.250
 some who call would say in 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.370
 instagram you will already know and also those of 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.540
 facebook mixter paulson is recording a 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.130
 disco with his band this is very cool I know 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.640
 that I can not tell you very much because 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.790
 they do not leave me very wide that does not count 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.500
 nothing do not say anything do not show anything until 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.260
 that everything is already recorded has finished 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.880
 but it's very cool obviously because 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.280
 not every day you have someone who 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.620
 is recording a record and I say that 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.050
 you saw the bag took years and years 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.600
 since I 've known him for many years 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.670
 I already had the idea that I wanted to record 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.670
 the record with his band and then try 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.830
 to sell 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.410
 they have not done it and they have 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.720
 we are all very happy and I have 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.560
 past these weeks good the latter 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.610
 days 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.170
 there stuck in the recording studio 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.810
 with them to see why me too 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.730
 I'm curious how a film is recorded 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.410
 disk from scratch not then how have you 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.170
 had a little the trajectory that they have 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.270
 gone wearing is a rock theme I wish 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.460
 be lucky and get it to be very 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.230
 high and have someone notice them and 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.750
 Well this does not go forward 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.450
 as soon as I can and I can in this 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.800
 to tell you because maybe someone will tell you 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.580
 may be interesting because there will be many 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.610
 sure to boys and girls who have the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.260
 dream of making a record and everything that I 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.570
 I can tell you from seen from outside 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.100
 from my point of view how he has 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.320
 seen today how all this has been done 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.690
 then later I will try to explain 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.230
 and tell it and in case someone 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.790
