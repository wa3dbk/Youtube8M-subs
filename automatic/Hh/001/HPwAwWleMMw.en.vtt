00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
be a colored pencil I so now you can see
i'm<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.540> part<00:01:24.930> today

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
i'm just going to do that part today

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
i'm just going to do that part today
only<00:01:25.470> four<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> front<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> camera<00:01:27.210> at

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
only four in front of the camera at

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.749 
only four in front of the camera at
least<00:01:27.450> um<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:31.009> now<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.070> take<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.340> straight

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
least um so now you take your straight

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
least um so now you take your straight
edge<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.939> consuming<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
edge this is very time consuming so just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940 
edge this is very time consuming so just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
entire drawing now you don't need your

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.510 
entire drawing now you don't need your
cutting<00:02:29.080> board<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.560> circle<00:02:30.570> now<00:02:31.570> um

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520

Stewart<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.459> blew<00:02:36.850> some<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
Stewart is now I just blew some of the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.150 
Stewart is now I just blew some of the
stuff<00:02:37.959> away<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.680> where<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> cut

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
stuff away so you can see where the cut

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:52.229 
stuff away so you can see where the cut
is<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.880> I'm<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.150> cut<00:02:41.110> along<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:52.120> you

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
is so I'm going to cut along here do you

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.880 
is so I'm going to cut along here do you
see<00:02:52.450> watch

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.559 

now<00:02:59.890> you<00:02:59.950> can<00:03:00.190> do<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.459> like<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> like<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.269> of

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
now you can do this like a like it's of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.800 
now you can do this like a like it's of
bricks<00:03:02.280> which<00:03:03.280> would<00:03:03.430> be<00:03:03.550> easy<00:03:03.760> more<00:03:04.540> than

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
bricks which would be easy more than

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.839 
bricks which would be easy more than
this<00:03:04.989> at<00:03:05.200> least<00:03:05.319> because<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.610> bricks

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
this at least because on the bricks

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.759 
this at least because on the bricks
there's<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.330> straight<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:07.870> straight<00:03:08.560> as

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
there's just straight and straight as

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:20.759 
there's just straight and straight as
way<00:03:09.010> easier<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:10.500> bricks<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:19.750> i<00:03:19.780> take<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
way easier and bricks but now i take the

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.449 
way easier and bricks but now i take the
grip<00:03:21.010> tape<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.989> rip<00:03:22.989> off<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.220> bucket

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
grip tape that I rip off I have a bucket

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.780 
grip tape that I rip off I have a bucket
full<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.849> grip<00:03:25.120> tape<00:03:25.360> for<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:30.780> now<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.760> did<00:03:33.760> a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
full of grip tape for that now I did a

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.430 
full of grip tape for that now I did a
different<00:03:34.209> design<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.900> don't<00:03:35.200> know<00:03:35.260> my

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
different design here I don't know my

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.589 
different design here I don't know my
hat<00:03:35.650> might<00:03:35.860> be<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.190> way<00:03:36.340> i<00:03:36.640> did<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
hat might be in the way i did a

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.569 
hat might be in the way i did a
different<00:03:38.079> um<00:03:38.910> design<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.209> my<00:03:41.579> trick

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
different um design on my trick

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.520 
different um design on my trick
skateboard<00:03:42.879> my<00:03:43.420> normal<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:46.530> normal

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
skateboard my normal like normal

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.059 
skateboard my normal like normal
skateboard<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.379> here<00:03:50.379> I'll<00:03:50.560> show<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.890> that

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
skateboard and here I'll show you that

skateboard and here I'll show you that
one<00:03:51.250> done<00:03:51.579> but<00:03:58.769> i'm<00:03:59.769> trying<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.100> do<00:04:00.220> this<00:04:00.400> fast

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
one done but i'm trying to do this fast

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.610 
one done but i'm trying to do this fast
so<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.299> might<00:04:01.450> actually<00:04:01.660> not<00:04:02.019> be<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.380> good

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
so it might actually not be that good

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.590 
so it might actually not be that good
just<00:04:03.609> hurting<00:04:03.940> because<00:04:04.060> i<00:04:04.209> don't<00:04:04.389> want<00:04:04.450> to
