00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.730 

the<00:00:00.420> question<00:00:00.780> today<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.050> how<00:00:01.260> do<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.620> get

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
the question today is how do you get

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.949 
the question today is how do you get
more<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.979> what<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.310> want<00:00:02.340> versus<00:00:03.330> what<00:00:03.360> you

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
more of what you want versus what you

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:12.169 
more of what you want versus what you
don't<00:00:04.230> want<00:00:04.470> so<00:00:10.670> Joseph<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.030> tell

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
don't want so Joseph what can you tell

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.629 
don't want so Joseph what can you tell
me<00:00:12.240> about<00:00:12.450> LCM<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.410> being<00:00:13.920> able<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> separate

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
me about LCM and being able to separate

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.640 
me about LCM and being able to separate
cells<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.120> want<00:00:15.299> from<00:00:15.929> cells<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> don't

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
cells you want from cells that you don't

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.519 
cells you want from cells that you don't
that's<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> good<00:00:17.970> question<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.380> have

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that's a good question so what we have

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
that's a good question so what we have
here<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.130> Arcturus<00:00:20.550> laser<00:00:20.880> capture

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
here is the Arcturus laser capture

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050 
here is the Arcturus laser capture
microdissection<00:00:21.680> system<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> dual<00:00:23.820> laser

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
microdissection system it's a dual laser

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.290 
microdissection system it's a dual laser
system<00:00:24.600> will<00:00:24.869> exactly<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.039> said

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
system will exactly do what you said

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.150 
system will exactly do what you said
take<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.779> tissue<00:00:28.170> section<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
take a look at this tissue section and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
take a look at this tissue section and
they<00:00:29.250> captured<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.630> want<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
they captured what so if you want and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
they captured what so if you want and
leave<00:00:31.470> cells<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> don't<00:00:32.099> want<00:00:32.279> behind<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.149> for

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
leave cells you don't want behind so for

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.110 
leave cells you don't want behind so for
example<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.989> you've<00:00:34.140> got<00:00:34.290> an<00:00:34.410> image<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
example here you've got an image of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
example here you've got an image of
cells<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> were<00:00:36.420> removed<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.230> backgrounds

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
cells that were removed from backgrounds

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.000 
cells that were removed from backgrounds
that<00:00:38.129> right<00:00:38.309> yes<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.710> see

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that right yes so you can actually see

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
that right yes so you can actually see
here<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> I've<00:00:41.610> already<00:00:41.700> cut<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> certain

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
here that I've already cut out a certain

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.920 
here that I've already cut out a certain
area<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.250> targeted<00:00:44.250> earlier<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> laser

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
area that targeted earlier so the laser

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.260 
area that targeted earlier so the laser
capture<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.370> able<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> mark

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
capture what you're able to do is mark

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
capture what you're able to do is mark
up<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> area<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.840> interest<00:00:49.200> mm-hmm<00:00:49.890> I've

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
up the area of interest mm-hmm I've

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.209 
up the area of interest mm-hmm I've
shown<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> quick<00:00:51.780> example<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.289> mm-hmm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
shown a quick example here mm-hmm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.950 
shown a quick example here mm-hmm
where<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.789> outline<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> areas<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
where I can just outline the areas of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.279 
where I can just outline the areas of
interest<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> touchscreen<00:00:56.670> monitor

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
interest on the touchscreen monitor

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.579 
interest on the touchscreen monitor
and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.429> can<00:00:59.579> hit<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.350> she<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
and you can hit the she will go and

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.130 
and you can hit the she will go and
capture<00:01:01.890> those<00:01:02.160> areas<00:01:02.519> for<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
capture those areas for you I see and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.830 
capture those areas for you I see and
then<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> video<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> illustrating<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.420> being

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
then this video is illustrating it being

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
then this video is illustrating it being
lifted<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:08.090> yes<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.280> LCF

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
lifted up yes so when we use is a LCF

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
lifted up yes so when we use is a LCF
cap<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> place<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.450> cattle<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.899> top

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cap so when you place this cattle on top

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
cap so when you place this cattle on top
of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> tissue<00:01:14.720> there's<00:01:15.720> nothing<00:01:16.020> happening

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
of the tissue there's nothing happening

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
of the tissue there's nothing happening
the<00:01:17.009> magic<00:01:17.399> is<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> laser<00:01:18.090> fires<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the magic is when the laser fires to the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
the magic is when the laser fires to the
cap<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.649> see<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:21.289> initially<00:01:22.289> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
cap so you can see here initially the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.139 
cap so you can see here initially the
user<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.830> look<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> screen<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.030> an

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
user will look at the screen and an

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.359 
user will look at the screen and an
outline<00:01:24.539> just<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.899> I<00:01:24.960> did<00:01:25.110> earlier<00:01:25.409> around

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
outline just like I did earlier around

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.830 
outline just like I did earlier around
the<00:01:26.460> areas<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:26.940> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> capture

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the areas that they want to capture

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.529 
the areas that they want to capture
I<00:01:27.869> see<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.979> downstream<00:01:29.460> once<00:01:30.300> they've

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
I see and then downstream once they've

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.469 
I see and then downstream once they've
got<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.050> sample<00:01:31.590> cells<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.520> interest<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.090> even

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
got the sample cells of interest or even

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
got the sample cells of interest or even
single<00:01:33.690> cell<00:01:33.990> onto<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.590> cap<00:01:34.800> then<00:01:35.159> what

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
single cell onto the cap then what

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.359 
single cell onto the cap then what
happens<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.270> once<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.289> have<00:01:37.440> your<00:01:37.500> sample<00:01:38.039> on

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
happens so once you have your sample on

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.350 
happens so once you have your sample on
the<00:01:38.429> cap<00:01:39.050> they'll<00:01:40.050> mate<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> 0.5

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the cap they'll mate with the 0.5

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.080 
the cap they'll mate with the 0.5
centrifuge<00:01:42.360> -<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.560> RNA<00:01:44.369> DNA<00:01:44.819> or

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
centrifuge - you have your RNA DNA or

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
centrifuge - you have your RNA DNA or
protein<00:01:45.690> extraction<00:01:46.020> buffer<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.009> will

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
protein extraction buffer and it will

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
protein extraction buffer and it will
lyse<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> cells<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.690> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
lyse the cells and then you can go on to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.380 
lyse the cells and then you can go on to
do<00:01:49.470> any<00:01:49.619> downstream<00:01:50.069> such<00:01:50.459> as<00:01:51.200> sequencing

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
do any downstream such as sequencing

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.779 
do any downstream such as sequencing
qPCR<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:55.799> some<00:01:56.009> users<00:01:56.369> were<00:01:56.520> doing

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
qPCR and then some users were doing

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.570 
qPCR and then some users were doing
protein<00:01:57.360> work<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.020> mass<00:01:58.229> spec<00:01:58.530> or

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
protein work will do mass spec or

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.180 
protein work will do mass spec or
raise<00:01:59.810> that's<00:02:00.810> great<00:02:01.080> well<00:02:01.620> thank<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.010> for
