00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.599
 tatyana slug hello father 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.890
 please tell me how to pray for 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.789
 suicides if they have hope of salvation 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.480
 thank you dear tatyana here is the last 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.869
 the decision of our orthodox church in 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 particulars and the bishop's cathedral 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:37.150
 that even such a rank was made 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.320
 where are the people who come to pray for 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.330
 their such kin 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.920
 that some they were committed 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:49.840
 I remember the prayer too 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.280
 such cases in particular 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.710
 and the life of Metropolitan Philaret 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 amphitheatrov it was such a lord 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 decent life Kiev Metropolitan and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.450
 there was such a case 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.520
 that the princess alone there imposed herself 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 hands it was sad and when they 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.909
 came to this the lords told about 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:26.049
 what happened he so extinguished Glinda I 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 already knew the girl there princess how 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.299
 sorry 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.049
 they blink Vladyka dear well and those and for 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.319
 It is impossible to read the burial can not pray so 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 turns to them as it is impossible 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:45.219
 Hebrew even command and blessing gave 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.310
 Well, it is certainly a particular private 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.859
 the church case and we mean there and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.859
 canons and rules where for the amount you can not beat 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:56.469
 it was open them and buried on 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.759
 a separate cemetery and here it is 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:04.229
 it appears that the lord even insisted 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:08.259
 to pray for this princess 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:13.510
 so there are different cases why people 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.250
 laid hands on myself I think that everything 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.630
 equal court of god 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.790
 and here is lord bishop aphanasius sugars y 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.770
 he has such an expression that the court 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.140
 human 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.020
 different from the judgment of God in that the judgment 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.250
 god how to more justify a court 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.970
 human how to more condemn therefore and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.170
 the holy Optina elders gave such 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.340
 even prayer 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.970
 where so close relatives could 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.489
 pray for those people here 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.770
 somehow or due to illness and 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.310
 still for some reason like this 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 put their hands on themselves here is impossible too 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 so here 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.350
 go too far they are called too 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.800
 zealous 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.110
 that is, everything must be the mercy of God on 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.080
 everything is all spread god is 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.930
 love says so in the sacred 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.230
 scripture want the death of a sinner and want 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.049
 lord punishes nobody lord herself 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.600
 love and wants to save everyone 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.299
 but who hasn't done what right there 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.010
 his various actions committed ponies 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.700
 mind to despair 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.090
 he himself will be judged and we should 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.250
 just hope for the mercy of God that 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.860
 love itself still covers everything and 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.120
 god wants to really save everyone 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.220
 and the court of God more justify therefore children 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.500
 how are you supposed to be calm sometimes 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.980
 you can just put a candle on the temple 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 according to st if not for a note on to write 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 This name because write in the note names 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.940
 those who suffered there some kind of nervous 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.850
 illness or something else attack and 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.470
 when we see the case but still 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.180
 the church blesses to put a candle 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.480
 how my God here you save love 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.850
 With your mercy, all this is ours 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.790
 there must be hope and to this we must 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.040
 always strive for yourself and have yourself 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.579
 such love under the help they you 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.579
 keeper
