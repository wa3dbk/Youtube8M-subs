the<00:00:47.460> weather<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:47.879> has<00:00:48.000> been<00:00:48.120> really

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the weather here has been really

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
the weather here has been really
inconsistent<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> decided<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> finish<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
inconsistent so I decided to finish the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
inconsistent so I decided to finish the
rest<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> indoors<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.199> positive<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
rest of it indoors but a positive or a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
rest of it indoors but a positive or a
silver<00:00:53.370> lining<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.760> guess<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.059> could<00:00:54.210> say<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
silver lining I guess you could say to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
silver lining I guess you could say to
the<00:00:54.899> inconsistent<00:00:55.530> weather<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the inconsistent weather is that I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
the inconsistent weather is that I
really<00:00:56.789> had<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> chance<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> test<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
really had a chance to test these in a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.900 
really had a chance to test these in a
variety<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.590> different<00:00:58.829> conditions<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.550> played

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
variety of different conditions I played

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.340 
variety of different conditions I played
three<00:01:00.149> games<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> had<00:01:00.809> four<00:01:01.020> training

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
three games and had four training

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
three games and had four training
sessions<00:01:01.800> half<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.309> which<00:01:02.489> were<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> rain

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
sessions half of which were in the rain

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.509 
sessions half of which were in the rain
and<00:01:03.270> heavy<00:01:03.780> rain<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.830> I've<00:01:05.189> really

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and heavy rain at that so I've really

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
and heavy rain at that so I've really
had<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> opportunity<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> give<00:01:06.689> these<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
had the opportunity to give these a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
had the opportunity to give these a
solid<00:01:07.409> test<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> last<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.430> weeks<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.160 
solid test over the last two weeks the
first<00:01:09.270> thing<00:01:09.450> I'll<00:01:09.540> talk<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.960> the

I said I've been wearing these for about
two<00:01:29.340> weeks<00:01:29.369> now

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
two weeks now

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
two weeks now
and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> discomfort<00:01:30.659> has<00:01:30.960> dialed<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> lot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and the discomfort has dialed down a lot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440 
and the discomfort has dialed down a lot
it's<00:01:32.130> less<00:01:32.460> than<00:01:32.610> half<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> used<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
it's less than half of what I used to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840

feel<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> still<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.700> I'm

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
feel but it is still there so I'm

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
feel but it is still there so I'm
thinking<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.240> nearing<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> end<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.110> that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
thinking I'm nearing the end of that

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
thinking I'm nearing the end of that
break-in<00:01:37.680> period<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> could<00:01:39.000> safely<00:01:39.210> say<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
break-in period so I could safely say to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
break-in period so I could safely say to
you<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> break-in<00:01:40.740> period<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.189> these

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you that the break-in period for these

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
you that the break-in period for these
would<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.610> about<00:01:41.790> two<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> three<00:01:42.360> weeks<00:01:42.570> but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
would be about two to three weeks but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
would be about two to three weeks but
apart<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.740> everything<00:01:44.310> else<00:01:44.430> is

was<00:02:39.810> such<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> big<00:02:40.290> selling<00:02:40.620> point<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> shoe

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
was such a big selling point of the shoe

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460 
was such a big selling point of the shoe
when<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.700> came<00:02:41.820> out<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:43.170> had<00:02:43.230> high

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
when it came out I just had high

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.380 
when it came out I just had high
expectations<00:02:43.860> which<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.850> assumed<00:02:45.210> other

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
expectations which I assumed other

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.610 
expectations which I assumed other
people<00:02:45.690> would<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.200> well

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
people would have as well

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.770 
people would have as well
but<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.460> saying<00:02:47.820> that's<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.570> case

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
but I'm just saying that's not the case

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.200 
but I'm just saying that's not the case
it<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.740> does<00:02:49.950> feel<00:02:50.250> quite<00:02:50.430> normal<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
it it does feel quite normal it's

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.560 
it it does feel quite normal it's
nothing<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:53.040> nothing<00:02:53.130> big<00:02:53.550> something<00:02:54.300> else

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
nothing it's nothing big something else

nothing it's nothing big something else
I<00:02:54.690> wanted<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> mention<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.680> heel<00:02:55.950> now<00:02:56.580> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
I wanted to mention is the heel now a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.950 
I wanted to mention is the heel now a
few<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> will<00:02:57.390> know<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:57.840> no

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
few of you will know that I'm no

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.470 
few of you will know that I'm no
stranger<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.470> f50s<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.880> may<00:03:00.030> only<00:03:00.210> be

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
stranger to f50s and it may only be

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
stranger to f50s and it may only be
because<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.870> my<00:03:01.020> past<00:03:01.350> experiences<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:01.980> f50s

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
because of my past experiences with f50s

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.520 
because of my past experiences with f50s
that<00:03:02.760> I've<00:03:02.850> noticed<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.300> but<00:03:04.080> instead<00:03:04.440> of

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that I've noticed this but instead of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.650 
that I've noticed this but instead of
having<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.830> tab<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.460> heel<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.330> tacit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
having a tab on the heel and a tacit

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.090 
having a tab on the heel and a tacit
raised<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.230> height<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.740> heel<00:03:07.950> all

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
raised the height of the heel all

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400 
raised the height of the heel all
together<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.480> works<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:09.870> well<00:03:10.200> in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
together and this works really well in

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410 
together and this works really well in
giving<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.740> an<00:03:10.800> extra<00:03:10.890> support<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
giving you an extra support and a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480 
giving you an extra support and a
locked-in<00:03:12.960> feel<00:03:13.260> not<00:03:13.740> locked<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
locked-in feel not locked in to the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.940 
locked-in feel not locked in to the
ground<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.270> soleplate<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.800> just

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
ground or to the soleplate but you just

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.770 
ground or to the soleplate but you just
feel<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> lot<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.400> secure<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.270> shoe<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
feel a lot more secure in the shoe and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.450 
feel a lot more secure in the shoe and
at<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.050> same<00:03:19.260> time<00:03:19.530> they've<00:03:19.830> managed<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.310> keep

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
at the same time they've managed to keep

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.330 
at the same time they've managed to keep
a<00:03:20.670> low<00:03:20.910> cut<00:03:21.240> around<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.720> ankle<00:03:22.110> area<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.710> this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
a low cut around the ankle area and this

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.160 
a low cut around the ankle area and this
just<00:03:23.550> works<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:24.030> well<00:03:24.240> together<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.930> it's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
just works really well together and it's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.660 
just works really well together and it's
something<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.590> didn't<00:03:25.920> notice<00:03:26.280> until<00:03:26.460> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
something I didn't notice until I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.880 
something I didn't notice until I
experienced<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.510> when<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.050> first<00:03:28.350> saw<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.590> boot

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
experienced it when I first saw the boot

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.470 
experienced it when I first saw the boot
is<00:03:29.130> not<00:03:29.280> something<00:03:29.610> that's<00:03:29.700> jumped<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.270> at<00:03:30.450> me

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
is not something that's jumped out at me

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.780 
is not something that's jumped out at me
I<00:03:30.780> sort<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.740> had<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> feel<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.370> while<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.550> was

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I sort of had to feel it while I was

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.940 
I sort of had to feel it while I was
playing<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:34.170> me<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.440> notice<00:03:34.800> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
playing in it for for me to notice it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.230 
playing in it for for me to notice it
and<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.250> wouldn't<00:03:35.490> expect<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.120> be

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
and I wouldn't expect this to be

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.690 
and I wouldn't expect this to be
interesting<00:03:36.870> or<00:03:37.220> notable<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.340> those<00:03:38.460> of<00:03:38.610> you

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
interesting or notable to those of you

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.100

about<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.420> three<00:04:15.690> stud<00:04:15.900> design<00:04:16.109> on<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> heel

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
about the three stud design on the heel

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.190 
about the three stud design on the heel
I<00:04:16.980> thought<00:04:17.520> that<00:04:17.730> stability<00:04:18.480> might<00:04:18.960> have<00:04:19.080> been

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I thought that stability might have been

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.700 
I thought that stability might have been
compromised<00:04:19.770> somehow<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:22.109> hasn't<00:04:22.560> it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
compromised somehow but it hasn't it

compromised somehow but it hasn't it
just

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950

just
very<00:04:23.250> normal<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.330> really<00:04:24.540> don't<00:04:24.720> notice

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
very normal and you really don't notice

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.930 
very normal and you really don't notice
it<00:04:25.170> when<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.650> comes<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.980> weight<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.460> f50

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940

adizero<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.990> light<00:04:28.230> boot<00:04:28.530> but<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.070> not<00:04:29.220> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
adizero is a light boot but it's not the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
adizero is a light boot but it's not the
lightest<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.210> think<00:04:30.420> that's<00:04:30.570> because<00:04:30.810> this

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
lightest and I think that's because this

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.260 
lightest and I think that's because this
time<00:04:31.260> around<00:04:31.290> they<00:04:32.070> focused<00:04:32.520> more<00:04:32.580> on<00:04:32.940> it

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270

being<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.660> comfortable<00:04:34.230> shoe

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
being a comfortable shoe

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.290 
being a comfortable shoe
compared<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:34.980> my<00:04:35.130> older<00:04:35.490> 50s<00:04:35.910> which<00:04:36.120> weighed

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
compared to my older 50s which weighed

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.400 
compared to my older 50s which weighed
346<00:04:37.080> pounds<00:04:37.350> these<00:04:38.130> weigh<00:04:38.450> 459<00:04:39.450> but<00:04:40.080> in<00:04:40.260> my

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
346 pounds these weigh 459 but in my

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.650 
346 pounds these weigh 459 but in my
opinion<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:41.040> this<00:04:41.190> boot<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:42.030> comfort<00:04:42.480> is

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
opinion for this boot the comfort is

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.780 
opinion for this boot the comfort is
worth<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> extra<00:04:43.200> weight<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.160> new<00:04:44.310> f50

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
worth the extra weight so the new f50

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.790 
worth the extra weight so the new f50
adizero<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> great<00:04:45.840> boot<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.470> quality

the high heel design there is some
break-in<00:04:55.920> time<00:04:56.160> involved<00:04:56.700> but<00:04:56.880> once<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.180> do

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
break-in time involved but once you do

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.880 
break-in time involved but once you do

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
recommend this as a good starting point

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.490 
recommend this as a good starting point
because<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.790> really<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.540> all<00:05:13.140> round<00:05:13.380> the
