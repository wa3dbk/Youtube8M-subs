00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.660 
going to put it get the steel rod ready
to<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:39.030> turn

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670

that

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.550 

diameter

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:42.849 

so<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.770> not<00:01:31.039> quite<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.609> deck

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:57.880 

little

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.910 

turn<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.640> off<00:01:58.930> there's<00:01:59.930> our<00:02:00.200> entry<00:02:00.350> point<00:02:00.590> and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
turn it off there's our entry point and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.039 
turn it off there's our entry point and
there's<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.220> hole<00:02:04.310> on<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.520> other<00:02:04.729> end<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.990> it

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
there's the hole on the other end so it

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.510 
there's the hole on the other end so it
actually<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.530> very<00:02:06.649> good<00:02:07.039> one<00:02:07.159> right<00:02:07.369> down

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
actually was a very good one right down

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
actually was a very good one right down
the<00:02:07.729> middle<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.380> then<00:02:09.380> what<00:02:09.560> I'll<00:02:09.739> do<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:11.330> I'll

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the middle so then what I'll do is I'll

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.220 
the middle so then what I'll do is I'll
actually<00:02:11.810> take<00:02:12.319> my<00:02:13.280> template<00:02:13.989> I'm<00:02:14.989> going<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
actually take my template I'm going to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.020 
actually take my template I'm going to
mark<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.650> where<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.700> hole<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
mark it where the hole is here and the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.199 
mark it where the hole is here and the
hole<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.450> back<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:23.030> my

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
hole is back here and I know on my

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.850 
hole is back here and I know on my
template<00:02:23.750> where<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.470> insertion

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
template where I want the insertion

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.559 
template where I want the insertion
point<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.510> exit<00:02:26.870> point<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:29.209> will

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
point and the exit point and then I will

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.910 
point and the exit point and then I will
trace<00:02:30.549> my<00:02:31.549> pattern

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.380 

and<00:02:38.920> I'll<00:02:39.040> go<00:02:39.280> ahead<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.670> cut<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:40.300> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and I'll go ahead and cut it out on the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.950 
and I'll go ahead and cut it out on the
bandsaw<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.080> start<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> process<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:43.510> know

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
bandsaw and start the process I know

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.900 
bandsaw and start the process I know
other<00:02:44.350> people<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.800> tried<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.070> cut<00:02:45.460> halfway

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
other people have tried to cut halfway

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.670 
other people have tried to cut halfway
in<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.450> then<00:02:46.540> start<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> other<00:02:47.170> end<00:02:47.440> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
in and then start on the other end that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.760 
in and then start on the other end that
will<00:02:48.040> never<00:02:48.400> work<00:02:48.840> at<00:02:49.840> least<00:02:49.990> not<00:02:50.260> with<00:02:50.470> me<00:02:50.620> I'm

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
will never work at least not with me I'm

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.800 
will never work at least not with me I'm
not<00:02:50.950> good<00:02:51.190> enough<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.350> keep<00:02:53.740> this<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.690> know

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
not good enough so I keep this you know

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.140 
not good enough so I keep this you know
that's<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> process<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.890> do<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:57.700> thing<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.000> do

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that's the process I do one thing to do

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.050 
that's the process I do one thing to do
on<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.480> steel<00:02:58.750> rod<00:02:58.960> is<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.710> to<00:03:00.160> get<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.490> get<00:03:01.030> it

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
on this steel rod is is to get it get it

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.210 
on this steel rod is is to get it get it
to<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.330> point<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.990> your<00:03:02.110> sander<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.100> then

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
to a point with your sander and then

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.790 
to a point with your sander and then
groove<00:03:03.750> put<00:03:04.750> some<00:03:04.930> ridges<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.440> there<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.680> your

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
groove put some ridges in there on your

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.350 
groove put some ridges in there on your
belt<00:03:06.010> sander<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.580> right<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.880> edge<00:03:07.090> and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
belt sander just right on the edge and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.970 
belt sander just right on the edge and
spin<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.870> as<00:03:08.020> you're<00:03:08.170> doing<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.710> create

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
spin it as you're doing it to create

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.610 
spin it as you're doing it to create
grooves<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.450> helps<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.590> hope

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
grooves and that really helps and I hope

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.970 
grooves and that really helps and I hope
that<00:03:12.010> will<00:03:12.460> help<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.790> guys<00:03:13.050> make<00:03:14.050> some<00:03:14.350> 3-wire
