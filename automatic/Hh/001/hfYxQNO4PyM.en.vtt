00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.549
 The body scanner is located first 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.859
 still in the new a-plus and the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.019
 It is also there by the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 federal police used the for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.400
 Travelers of the United States increased 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.230
 safety requirements will apply 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 travelers randomly manually 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
 Controls whether passengers by hand 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 want to let search or just on 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.279
 modern art is free to you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 Body scanner has several advantages 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.360
 efficient and effective because you because 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 he works much faster 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.180
 can have a control one 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 Security check with the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840
 body scanner done in ten seconds 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.860
 to have 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.780
 He marks objects, for example 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 using a pictogram that is it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.690
 would not be a real picture of the body 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 represented but only stick figures 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.480
 so to speak, and that looks like it once 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 the passenger in the body scanner on the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 given place is the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 Air Security Assistant Automatic 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.309
 control in gear 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 for error-free control 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 be selected whether a man or a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 woman to be scanned 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 now drives between the glass panes 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 high-tech technology three seconds 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 does it take until the so-called 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.900
 Millimeter waves captured the people 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.950
 the millimeter waves have them in 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.409
 choose relatively long 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.700
 Today we know them from cell phones when they are 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.659
 have today handy on the ear then have 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.370
 they work, we are also 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 millimeter waves 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.180
 the widespread adoption in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.390
 frankfurt would X-rays 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 used is thus a misconception 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 be displayed to the monitor 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.330
 pictograms show yellow markings 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 the checkers objects to the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.050
 do not belong to the body 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 according to the current level of knowledge 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.290
 she unscrupulously through this scanner 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 run exceptions 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.100
 they are pregnant or could become pregnant 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 be a little child or you are 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 carry metallic devices in the body like 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.110
 pacemaker insulin pump or 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 similar that is larger than two meters 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.330
 or less than a meter 20 can 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 also does not scan 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.110
 that does not do anything extraordinary on 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.300
 He can not get body tight without another one 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 scan the plane to run what the control 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.080
 accelerated process 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.180
 he has become faster the advantages 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 is quite clear on the hand both 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.320
 for the federal police for the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.050
 Air Security Assistants as well 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.380
 the passenger 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.380
 Of course not necessarily 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.150
 Frankfurt must be scanned 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.220
 first german airport of the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.440
 body scanner of the most modern technology in the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.450
 also has use on other German 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920
 Airports are scheduled to open later this year 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.550
 single body scanner installed 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.550
 become
