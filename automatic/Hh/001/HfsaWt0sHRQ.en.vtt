00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay so now it's in here and this is

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000 
okay so now it's in here and this is
about<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:04.980> looks<00:00:05.009> like<00:00:05.400> at<00:00:05.609> first

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
about what it looks like at first

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.230 
about what it looks like at first
now<00:00:08.010> something<00:00:08.429> you're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:09.000> to

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
now something you're going to have to

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
now something you're going to have to
remember<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:11.210> that<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.830> will<00:00:14.009> always<00:00:14.219> end<00:00:14.610> up

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
remember is that it will always end up

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.099 
remember is that it will always end up
being<00:00:14.880> lighter<00:00:15.210> than<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.780> looks<00:00:15.809> like

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
being lighter than what it looks like

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.240 
being lighter than what it looks like
after<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> out<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> water

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
after you take it out of the water

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
after you take it out of the water
because<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.300> how<00:00:18.480> someone's<00:00:18.900> something

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
because you know how someone's something

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.900 
because you know how someone's something
gets<00:00:19.560> wet<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> looks<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.250> darker<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
gets wet it looks a little darker and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.929 
gets wet it looks a little darker and
also<00:00:21.769> well<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.130> it

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
also well that's about it

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570 
also well that's about it
and<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:25.260> think<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> dye<00:00:25.890> dries<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and I think some of the dye dries out of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
and I think some of the dye dries out of
it<00:00:26.670> too<00:00:27.260> when<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.470> happens<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:29.010> why<00:00:29.160> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it too when that happens that's why it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.389 
it too when that happens that's why it
gets<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:30.560> that's<00:00:31.560> why<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.920> gets<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.279> little

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
gets up that's why it gets a little

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
gets up that's why it gets a little
lighter<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.210> pain<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
lighter and it's a pain because it's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.870 
lighter and it's a pain because it's
hard<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> right<00:00:35.130> shade<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
hard to get the right shade and that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.280 
hard to get the right shade and that
won't<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.329> being<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> reddish

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
won't end up being more of a reddish

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.150 
won't end up being more of a reddish
brown<00:00:37.440> than<00:00:37.980> a--<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:40.980> over

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
brown than a-- and here this one over

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.389 
brown than a-- and here this one over
here<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:42.120> if<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.300> zoom<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.660> yep<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.190> ended

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
here see if i zoom in yep this one ended

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
here see if i zoom in yep this one ended
up<00:00:44.460> being<00:00:44.730> more<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> reddish<00:00:45.329> brown<00:00:45.450> than<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
up being more of a reddish brown than it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.520 
up being more of a reddish brown than it
did<00:00:50.210> dark<00:00:51.210> brown<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.930> was<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.289> for

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
did dark brown which if I was going for

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
did dark brown which if I was going for
but<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.920> guess<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> shadows<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
but I guess if I'm in the shadows that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.580 
but I guess if I'm in the shadows that
won't<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:55.050> too<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
won't really make too much of a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.599 
won't really make too much of a
difference<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.829> basically<00:00:58.980> push

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
difference so you just basically push

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.799 
difference so you just basically push
this<00:00:59.789> down<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.210> man<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.870> water<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> cold

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
this down in here man this water is cold

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.120 
this down in here man this water is cold
and<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.870> push<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:07.130> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and you push this down in here and you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.289 
and you push this down in here and you
can<00:01:08.280> use<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.520> hands<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.939> long<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> don't

completely covered you don't have to
worry<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.000> about

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
worry about that and do that for about

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.760 
worry about that and do that for about
an<00:01:24.540> hour<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.509> every<00:01:27.750> 20<00:01:28.049> minutes<00:01:28.200> rotate

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
an hour you know every 20 minutes rotate

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
an hour you know every 20 minutes rotate
it<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.950> flip<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> over<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.210> pick<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> up

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750

and<00:01:30.840> flip<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.079> over<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479

completely covered I wouldn't worry too
much<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.600> easy

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
much about that it's really an easy

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.499 
much about that it's really an easy
process<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.640> die<00:01:38.729> multiple<00:01:39.270> cloths

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
process and you can die multiple cloths

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
process and you can die multiple cloths
at<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> time<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.770> keep<00:01:40.860> track<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
at a time you just have to keep track of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
or something I don't know what they make
it<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.429> works<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.119> very<00:02:09.390> potent

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840

salt in there not too much because that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.500 
salt in there not too much because that
helps<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.180> stick<00:03:33.330> into<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:36.500> cloth<00:03:38.330> then<00:03:39.330> just

results so I decided to add this part on
the<00:04:33.539> video<00:04:34.669> sorry<00:04:35.669> about<00:04:35.879> the<00:04:35.999> confusion<00:04:36.180> but

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
the video sorry about the confusion but

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.170 
the video sorry about the confusion but
anyways<00:04:37.529> it's<00:04:38.039> ended<00:04:38.340> up<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.669> look<00:04:38.819> like<00:04:38.969> this

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
anyways it's ended up to look like this

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.649 
anyways it's ended up to look like this
it's<00:04:39.449> a<00:04:39.539> very<00:04:39.569> dark<00:04:40.110> green<00:04:40.889> color<00:04:41.249> and<00:04:41.659> it's

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
it's a very dark green color and it's

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.129 
it's a very dark green color and it's
looking<00:04:42.900> pretty<00:04:43.110> good<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.289> far<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:45.389> think<00:04:45.779> I

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
looking pretty good so far I think I

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.100 
looking pretty good so far I think I
will<00:04:46.289> put<00:04:46.499> it<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.740> here<00:04:46.979> a<00:04:47.009> little<00:04:47.159> longer

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
will put it in here a little longer

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.149 
will put it in here a little longer
because<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.229> want<00:04:49.409> it<00:04:49.439> to<00:04:49.499> look<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.800> little<00:04:49.949> more

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
because I want it to look a little more

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.429 
because I want it to look a little more
natural<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.419> know<00:04:51.569> that's<00:04:51.870> probably<00:04:52.139> not

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
natural but I know that's probably not

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.029 
natural but I know that's probably not
gonna<00:04:52.740> do<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.400> whole<00:04:53.490> lot<00:04:53.969> more<00:04:54.029> to<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.919> but<00:04:55.919> it

gonna do a whole lot more to it but it

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.869 
gonna do a whole lot more to it but it
looks<00:04:56.520> nice<00:04:57.090> II<00:04:57.270> think<00:04:58.009> it<00:04:59.009> looks<00:04:59.340> all<00:04:59.639> in
