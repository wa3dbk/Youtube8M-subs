nice<00:07:11.090> chemistry<00:07:11.270> I<00:07:13.240> mean<00:07:14.240> that<00:07:14.360> one<00:07:14.540> for<00:07:14.780> me<00:07:14.900> it

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
nice chemistry I mean that one for me it

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.790 
nice chemistry I mean that one for me it
just<00:07:15.200> felt<00:07:15.560> like<00:07:16.060> to<00:07:17.060> some<00:07:17.330> point<00:07:17.660> and<00:07:18.110> what's

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
just felt like to some point and what's

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.890 
just felt like to some point and what's
the<00:07:18.890> spectre<00:07:19.250> was<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.610> head<00:07:19.970> like<00:07:20.420> by<00:07:20.600> a<00:07:20.630> wide

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
the spectre was a head like by a wide

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.130 
the spectre was a head like by a wide
margin<00:07:20.930> there<00:07:21.500> was<00:07:21.680> just<00:07:22.390> not<00:07:23.390> enough<00:07:23.450> and<00:07:23.900> on

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
margin there was just not enough and on

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.540 
margin there was just not enough and on
the<00:07:24.260> team<00:07:24.470> and<00:07:24.650> I<00:07:24.770> think<00:07:25.010> honey<00:07:25.190> actually

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
the team and I think honey actually

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.680 
the team and I think honey actually
mentioned<00:07:25.850> something<00:07:26.060> that<00:07:26.180> ended<00:07:26.390> up<00:07:26.480> being

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
mentioned something that ended up being

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.300 
mentioned something that ended up being
extremely<00:07:27.140> important<00:07:27.650> is<00:07:27.770> they<00:07:27.980> didn't<00:07:28.190> end

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
extremely important is they didn't end

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.770 
extremely important is they didn't end
up<00:07:28.430> having<00:07:28.700> a<00:07:28.790> double<00:07:28.910> ravaged<00:07:29.300> fast<00:07:29.510> enough

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
up having a double ravaged fast enough

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.390 
up having a double ravaged fast enough
like<00:07:30.320> I<00:07:30.410> actually<00:07:30.560> think<00:07:30.860> if<00:07:31.010> they<00:07:31.130> had<00:07:31.280> it

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
like I actually think if they had it

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.500 
like I actually think if they had it
sooner<00:07:31.760> it<00:07:31.910> would<00:07:32.030> have<00:07:32.120> made<00:07:32.210> a<00:07:32.270> huge

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 
sooner it would have made a huge

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.690 
sooner it would have made a huge
difference<00:07:32.690> in<00:07:32.960> the<00:07:33.050> game<00:07:33.170> I<00:07:33.410> agree<00:07:34.070> I<00:07:34.250> mean<00:07:34.580> I

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
difference in the game I agree I mean I

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.860 
difference in the game I agree I mean I
think<00:07:34.730> the<00:07:35.000> double<00:07:35.270> ravage<00:07:35.510> would<00:07:35.660> have<00:07:35.750> been

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
think the double ravage would have been

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.050 
think the double ravage would have been
one<00:07:36.020> but<00:07:36.500> also<00:07:36.650> think<00:07:36.980> to<00:07:37.370> me<00:07:37.580> like<00:07:37.760> there<00:07:37.940> was

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:38.060 
one but also think to me like there was

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.200 
one but also think to me like there was
the<00:07:38.600> kind<00:07:38.810> of<00:07:38.840> the<00:07:38.960> first
