00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.950
 The third one is called a student human rights jorr. 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:13.519
 There are now laws that let you further protect the socially disadvantaged student rights 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.809
 I think it is somehow weak students than teachers would have required action 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.410
 The same 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:23.900
 Now, what do you do because teachers say you are having difficulties? 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:28.990
 So I did not know the details yesterday, so I told you the instructions. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.990
 Talk of student rights QI ago when I just heard it 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:38.650
 Easier to get students with disabilities Human rights ignored in some crazy nickname among teachers in schools 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.320
 Well, you know what, these guys, 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.330
 I have a person who makes a target 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:52.150
 But multiple sources are but a central bowl Perhaps this because those people 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:54.010
 The talk comes out, and the all-star officer now suppresses human freedom. 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.360
 One that geureondeyo 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.020
 The school is where I went to study if I'm sure it helps to study. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.250
 I think that any such appropriate restrictions are clearly needed. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.630
 But I guess that's why it really helps to study . 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.860
 It's a good story . 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.490
 This is what I'm worried about. 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.380
 I do these things happened since this is going to come talk 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.520
 When you say it, you do not get it when you smile. 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.820
 Disability 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.020
 But if you say anything, you're going to be careful now. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.450
 When teachers say the adjuster so you do get a teacher or parent our babies 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.549
 You do not know that you have human rights. 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.060
 What these words come from the mouth, junior civil rights of one of them 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.680
 Like those privileges that they are better at school at school 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.180
 Even if you think trees 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.469
 Human rights should not be understood that way. Yet another example. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.159
 I'm writing to you. 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.159
 On the spot 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.460
 The sad stories are the big boys itjyo voice, whereas gulgo so far did not get 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.890
 After the problem , the problematic children's voice became bigger. 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.319
 I thought that you would not do us any good . 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.550
 So what kind of keys do you get? 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.450
 4 And the sad cases are that those who tried to study hard would not be able to study 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.040
 Be 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.290
 I do not send it to your child's school, but as your voice grows, 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 You will not be able to study your pak. 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:30.319
 If you think you're tearing up crabs and your teachers are getting weaker. 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.500
 It's a serious thing. It's a serious thing. 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.349
 Students are getting rid of human rights. 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.370
 You know what it's about. 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:46.040
 It's just human rights. This is another problem. 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 Mutual respect for human rights should go to a story. Teacher's human rights and student human rights 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.760
 I need to find the answer to be respected. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.489
 Land cases students how to protect and respect the human rights of each other come to talk again 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.510
 Can I challenge the teacher haejwoya rights of parents 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:04.640
 Another parent teacher bulreoda clean and I heard something strange sikindaneun 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:09.140
 So it's time for a teacher who is a member of our school to grow up . 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.609
 Annya not understand the position of the soup as parents learn from the bad guys 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.489
 Then crews 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:18.200
 What parents do not think my position is to reogo 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:22.459
 So what are you doing kid so this is all just talk to each other I mean his position 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.569
 No're in a position right now to practice than just in this situation, 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.100
 Simply 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:32.600
 Only thing that I tell you that human rights are important so are you one another 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.319
 I could give birth to a problem before a problem between men and women also ttokgatdago their passport or namgeon 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.160
 Is it 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.780
 Sign it, and I gotta pay more get access eunikka we've a lot of art 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.040
 There's another problem. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.329
 If you're wise , it's a wise choice. 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.680
 It's the answer. 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.700
 This is not the only thing that causes the problem. 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.090
 You are brought 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.859
 I mean, look, you guys are on the 4th floor. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.660
 I have a great will and the classroom is gone, but nobody is taking classes. 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:06.730
 I personally feel insulted. 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:10.110
 The jyeotneunde now fallen to the ground full rights of teachers that come here to study children 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.300
 I do not have the power to control it. 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:19.530
 I presented absurd apocrypha, and I have a song in front of me. 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:24.180
 I also studied singing that do not say they should not sing that part 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.020
 Iteunikka'll sing with it should not have absolute control of the scene 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.430
 I do so because the controls have to teach each other how to be a human rights 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.030
 Can it be respected 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:38.490
 I'm gonna have to class when the class while the total weight Student Rights 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.350
 Students also learn to come right here to point out the great tribulation me like comfortable unjust teachers 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.910
 I need to be able to study while I'm taking it . 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:49.800
 And it's like school , and you should not paint your friends . It's a crime. 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:53.310
 I mean, like school, sex crime, I got a crime that tore money like that. 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.020
 Everyone in your comic room is sent to jail. 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.020
 I do not know what to do at school. 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.750
 Nowadays this idea deunya human rights issues must be approached in such dimension not 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.240
 He would protect only the freedom that the students go out to talk compa So the city 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.700
 It's going to get worse 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.650
 Can it again weaker students so plagued mutual Liao students at my school 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.640
 I have to be serious about things . 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.060
 Will people look at this school I have not known him in self-class covered juneunde 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.080
 Drop the buffer. 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:31.220
 It's serious. You have to let the teacher teach you. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.820
 You are in class , and while others are not listening and disturbing you, 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.639
 How would you like to be punished if you do not listen to people ? 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.510
 I have a problem with punishment . 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:46.130
 And the students are almost criminal about bullying each other . 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.780
 Harassing another friend is a punishment that teaches that it is serious 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.370
 The book should come out. 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.300
 Then the kid you wear the school teachers shark students to self bunpulyi target 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.979
 I can not. 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:02.960
 We can not have a punishment book for a certain teacher, so we can not just come up with this punishment book . 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:07.850
 Of course, human rights education is the first in person education , 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.290
 I can do less stress on the sofa and keep it under maintenance. 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:16.430
 When recording the parents addition to any punishment this way just decided nayaji 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:21.200
 If you just do it without doing it, it can create another problem. 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:25.550
 Somehow this is not the only answer , but the experts. 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.200
 I wish I could say that human rights are not just ours . 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.270
 You have to take responsibility. 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:37.400
 If you do not ask for responsibility as well as human rights, it is a real indulgence. 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:41.390
 Gets more out ruin your entire day is safe to Yes 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.229
 If you can send your children, 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.630
 For my values still have haejumyeonseo war basically my classes so 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:51.710
 I'm hoping you'll come. 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.770
 I hope that with each other so if you want something done this not done 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:07:00.200
 Teacher teachers will not train. Actually, 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:05.389
 What did you point out if I touched you? I was an instructor when I was in the army. 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:10.010
 You can come to one of them, watch it together, and then do not train . 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:12.380
 Training hard because I do not thereby 17 people do get the point anyway. 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:16.710
 The salary comes out 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:21.300
 It's a shame to run in this way. It's a bad thing. 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:25.650
 The harder the teachers, the harder the students are doing the worse things 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:31.770
 Children who want to study while equipped with a system to help them 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.240
 Going without a circle and being such a thing of the unjust teachers of the intimidation of unfaithful friends 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:39.030
 What is 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.580
 So now that you are in a harsh environment, 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:46.080
 We wish that the study room to make 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:51.080
 Yes, human rights issues should always be studied mutually and responsibly. 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.080
 I want to talk to you with certainty .
