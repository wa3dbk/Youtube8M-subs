spot<00:01:10.479> on<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.020> back<00:01:11.170> it's<00:01:11.469> got<00:01:11.619> no<00:01:11.770> guns<00:01:12.340> that

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
spot on the back it's got no guns that

can<00:01:12.729> really<00:01:12.969> hit<00:01:13.240> back<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.719> far<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.469> you're

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
can really hit back that far so you're

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.950 
can really hit back that far so you're
going<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.369> need<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.609> either<00:01:15.729> swerve<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.810> get

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
going to need to either swerve to get

side<00:01:17.289> guns<00:01:17.530> onto<00:01:17.799> it<00:01:18.069> or<00:01:18.359> just<00:01:19.359> try<00:01:19.569> to<00:01:19.630> keep

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
side guns onto it or just try to keep

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.620 
side guns onto it or just try to keep
the<00:01:19.990> speed<00:01:20.259> up<00:01:20.289> which<00:01:20.770> means<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:22.359> event

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
the speed up which means in the event

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.599 
the speed up which means in the event
that<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.530> can't<00:01:24.780> keep<00:01:25.780> your<00:01:26.219> guns<00:01:27.219> on<00:01:27.429> them

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
that you can't keep your guns on them

that you can't keep your guns on them
the<00:01:28.329> gun<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.539> best<00:01:28.899> bet<00:01:29.109> is<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.409> start<00:01:29.920> working

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
the gun is best bet is to start working

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.739 
the gun is best bet is to start working
on<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.999> hull<00:01:31.149> whilst<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.229> have<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.619> engineer

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
on the hull whilst you have a engineer

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.590 
on the hull whilst you have a engineer
Manning<00:01:34.749> those<00:01:34.990> back<00:01:35.319> engines<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.600> second

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
Manning those back engines and a second

Manning those back engines and a second
engineer<00:01:38.020> Organa<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.639> go<00:01:39.759> for<00:01:39.939> your<00:01:40.060> main

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
engineer Organa to go for your main

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.830 
engineer Organa to go for your main
engine

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
engine

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
engine
to<00:01:41.350> make<00:01:41.500> sure<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.039> chance<00:01:42.310> of

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
to make sure that you have a chance of

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.380 
to make sure that you have a chance of
escaping<00:01:44.549> even<00:01:45.549> though<00:01:45.670> it's<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> mediumship

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
escaping even though it's a mediumship

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.969 
escaping even though it's a mediumship
it's<00:01:46.659> still<00:01:46.899> quite<00:01:47.140> fast<00:01:47.409> in<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.710> straight<00:01:47.740> line

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
it's still quite fast in a straight line

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.330 
it's still quite fast in a straight line
but<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:49.119> can't<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.689> turn<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.530> smaller<00:01:50.979> ships

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
but it can't out turn the smaller ships

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.819 
but it can't out turn the smaller ships
which<00:01:51.609> makes<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.030> difficult<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:53.109> compete<00:01:53.469> with

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
which makes it difficult to compete with

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.490 
which makes it difficult to compete with
guns<00:01:54.609> like<00:01:54.969> carronades<00:01:55.600> on<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.899> forward<00:01:56.200> slot

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
guns like carronades on the forward slot

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.249 
guns like carronades on the forward slot
which<00:01:56.950> require<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.909> face<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.509> ship<00:01:59.049> and

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
which require you to face the ship and

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.380 
which require you to face the ship and
if<00:02:00.130> you're<00:02:00.310> trying<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.729> do<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.149> close

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
if you're trying to do that in close

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.999 
if you're trying to do that in close
range<00:02:01.509> which<00:02:01.899> you<00:02:02.079> need<00:02:02.229> for<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> carronade

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
range which you need for a carronade

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.209 
range which you need for a carronade
you're<00:02:03.670> going<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.030> struggle<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:05.560> for<00:02:06.100> this
