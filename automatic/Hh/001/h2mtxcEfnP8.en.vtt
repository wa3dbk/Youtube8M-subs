too<00:02:24.030> many<00:02:24.150> options<00:02:24.420> in<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.160> WMA<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:28.220> app<00:02:29.220> but

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
too many options in this WMA you app but

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
too many options in this WMA you app but
we're<00:02:29.970> hoping<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.300> later<00:02:30.750> versions<00:02:31.170> will

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
we're hoping that later versions will

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.280 
we're hoping that later versions will
come<00:02:31.890> out<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.160> alt<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.580> sorts<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
come out with alt all sorts of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.560 
come out with alt all sorts of
ridiculous

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.660 

so<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:39.750> basically<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.340> whole<00:02:41.459> app

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so that's basically the the whole app

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.559 
so that's basically the the whole app
there<00:02:42.330> aren't<00:02:42.510> too<00:02:42.720> many<00:02:42.750> features<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
there aren't too many features in the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.150 
there aren't too many features in the
app<00:02:45.600> besides<00:02:46.020> taking<00:02:46.380> pictures<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.890> giving

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
app besides taking pictures and giving
