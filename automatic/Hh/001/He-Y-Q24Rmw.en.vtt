00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 all the rays of good with you and the mayor well, now 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.410
 third release of landing on an aircraft carrier 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.290
 many of you asked me to show you how 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.139
 whistles are fighting because the deck reagents 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.250
 there is not only the United States is a panther but there is 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.710
 also uk 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.199
 although a total of three is two 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.000
 panthers and one meteor, I still decided 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.550
 make a video of your requests and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 show how to plant them immediately say 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 video is short so okay u said earlier 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.250
 there are only three of us 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 so let's start with the Americans and first on 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 the queue is at 9 and v2 panther 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
 everything is very simple here personally by mine 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 sensations jet planes land 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 all easier but it is natural pilgrims 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.379
 the main thing is to go in early to land 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 to slow down then all the same 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.250
 we fly jet planes and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 they have great speeds for that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 use the air brake well or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 scissors in general, as you prefer it will be 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 also compared to piston 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.579
 planes do not need to keep very low 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 landing speed there 170 160 here 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.489
 220 or even 230 is enough 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 so don't bother with that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.869
 you now see how I fight on 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.330
 panther so fly up at speed somewhere 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 a little more than two hundred and thirty kilometers 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 per hour to the aircraft carrier right before landing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 I pull away dramatically to smoothly 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 plan touching on deck 220 and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.049
 instantly mating which cable 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.869
 the next plane is f9 in 5 panthers it 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.210
 later v972 modification 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.189
 in general, everything is just the same 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 except that he is so fast as 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 I was big and a pre-removed traction 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 to reset it and touch become and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.280
 deck I'm at a speed of 200 kilometers in 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680
 an hour you can certainly try less 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.930
 so that the touch speed was but why 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.229
 bother yourself if I sat up 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.869
 at a speed of 220 in general, something like that and we 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 approached the last representative 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.399
 carrier jet aircraft which 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 available in our game this is meteor f3 for 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.200
 britain no matter how banal everything is 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.390
 as with the panthers though 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.579
 side this miker seemed to me 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 a little bit hard handling on 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.099
 low speed in general we fly up to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 an aircraft carrier at 230 before him we remove those 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.270
 shit 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.720
 and for 200 kilometers an hour we touch the deck 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.840
 landing successfully we are heroes all girls 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.360
 Our random fell before us also 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.760
 I want to note that when you recharge 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.340
 from on an aircraft carrier you will appear immediately 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 air you do not need to take off but 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.200
 conclusion would be more accurate 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.930
 repeated that the deck reagents by 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.610
 it's my opinion to plant everyone easier now 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.330
 the game may well something in the future and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.240
 to apologize 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.240
 but at the moment it is also so plant 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.340
 I usually did not try the reagents, but then 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.170
 I'll try saying they can be planted 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.020
 normal in realistic fights 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.360
 Generally if a video will set the wait Well 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.160
 Well , I have this all with you was mr 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.980
 Odessa video you liked to put 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.110
 likes subscribe to the channel 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 and of course see you in sight
