my<00:00:20.039> project<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.760> self-healing<00:00:21.420> mat<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
my project a self-healing mat and a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.529 
my project a self-healing mat and a
ruler<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.800> make<00:00:23.550> sure<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> don't<00:00:24.090> cut<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.390> my

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
ruler to make sure I don't cut up my

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.189 
ruler to make sure I don't cut up my
tables<00:00:25.170> I've<00:00:25.289> lay<00:00:25.740> down<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.160> self-healing<00:00:26.760> mat

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
tables I've lay down my self-healing mat

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.580 
tables I've lay down my self-healing mat
my<00:00:28.199> project<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.859> top<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:31.230> my

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
my project on top of it and then my

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.179 
my project on top of it and then my
ruler

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
ruler

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
ruler
I<00:00:32.219> place<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.880> exacto<00:00:33.570> blade<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.260> cut<00:00:34.500> line

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I place my exacto blade on the cut line

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790 
I place my exacto blade on the cut line
and<00:00:35.040> slide<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:36.059> ruler<00:00:36.420> next<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> exacto

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and slide my ruler next to the exacto

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.060 
and slide my ruler next to the exacto
blade<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.420> repeat<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.530> bottom<00:00:40.710> line

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
blade and repeat this on the bottom line

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
blade and repeat this on the bottom line
as<00:00:41.370> well<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.719> usually<00:00:42.930> happens<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> me

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
as well so this usually happens to me

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
as well so this usually happens to me
when<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.100> line<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.760> ruler<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> bottom

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
when I line up my ruler with the bottom

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.830 
when I line up my ruler with the bottom
cut<00:00:46.020> line<00:00:46.230> my<00:00:46.739> top<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.280> slightly<00:00:47.789> moves<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
cut line my top one slightly moves so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.790 
cut line my top one slightly moves so
then<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.399> top<00:00:50.870> cut<00:00:51.870> mark<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
then I go back up to my top cut mark and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000 
then I go back up to my top cut mark and
slide<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> ruler<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.449> place<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
slide the ruler back in place and then I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.160 
slide the ruler back in place and then I
can<00:00:56.309> eyeball<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.629> bottom<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
can eyeball and see that my bottom is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439 
can eyeball and see that my bottom is
still<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> position<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.489> now<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.149> ready<00:01:00.359> to

with cover weight paper I like to score

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960 
with cover weight paper I like to score
it<00:01:08.050> twice<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.680> make<00:01:08.740> sure<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.310> cut<00:01:09.640> all<00:01:09.820> the

way<00:01:10.120> through<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:12.250> my<00:01:12.370> next<00:01:12.700> cut<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.150> will<00:01:13.450> turn

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
way through with my next cut I will turn

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.080 
way through with my next cut I will turn
my<00:01:14.590> project<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.720> since<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.440> did<00:01:17.770> cut<00:01:18.070> off<00:01:18.220> one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
my project and since I did cut off one

my project and since I did cut off one
of<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.360> guides<00:01:20.140> already<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.490> where<00:01:21.670> a

of the guides already this is where a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.180 
of the guides already this is where a
t-square<00:01:22.180> comes<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.690> handy<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.980> underline

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
t-square comes in handy and I underline

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.570 
t-square comes in handy and I underline
everything<00:01:24.880> up<00:01:25.120> against<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.920> tables<00:01:27.370> edge

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
everything up against the tables edge

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
using a t-square I know that this edges

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.830 
using a t-square I know that this edges
will<00:01:41.830> be<00:01:41.920> straight<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.850> I'm<00:01:43.210> ready<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.660> make

sliding the exacto against the ruler

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.080 
sliding the exacto against the ruler
you're<00:01:53.170> not<00:01:53.380> looking<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.860> cut<00:01:54.310> into<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.820> ruler

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you're not looking to cut into the ruler

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.370 
you're not looking to cut into the ruler
just<00:01:55.479> using<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.440> as<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> straight<00:01:57.130> edge<00:01:57.340> guide

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
just using it as a straight edge guide

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680 
just using it as a straight edge guide
my<00:01:59.380> third<00:01:59.979> cut<00:02:00.310> was<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.729> same<00:02:00.970> as<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.270> last

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
my third cut was the same as the last

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.140 
my third cut was the same as the last
cut<00:02:02.020> lining<00:02:02.860> up<00:02:02.979> my<00:02:03.130> exacto<00:02:03.640> knife<00:02:03.820> with<00:02:04.030> the

cut lining up my exacto knife with the
cut<00:02:04.330> line<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.840> cutting<00:02:06.150> for<00:02:07.150> my<00:02:07.240> final<00:02:07.690> cut<00:02:07.900> I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
cut line and cutting for my final cut I

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.229 
cut line and cutting for my final cut I
will<00:02:08.590> need<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.890> measure<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:09.820> is<00:02:10.030> where

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
will need to measure this is where

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.110 
will need to measure this is where
knowing<00:02:10.510> your<00:02:11.130> project<00:02:12.130> size<00:02:12.310> will<00:02:12.610> come<00:02:12.820> in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
knowing your project size will come in

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.890 
knowing your project size will come in
very<00:02:14.019> handy<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.580> five<00:02:15.850> by<00:02:16.090> seven<00:02:16.150> five

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
very handy so this is five by seven five

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.460 
very handy so this is five by seven five
wide<00:02:17.230> by<00:02:17.560> 7<00:02:18.040> tall<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.360> will<00:02:19.690> go<00:02:19.900> ahead<00:02:20.050> and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
wide by 7 tall so I will go ahead and
