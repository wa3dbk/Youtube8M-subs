we're<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> work<00:00:06.000> now<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.420> creating<00:00:06.840> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
we're going to work now on creating a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.920 
we're going to work now on creating a
surface<00:00:07.140> design<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.920> our<00:00:07.950> painted<00:00:08.400> page<00:00:08.969> what

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
surface design for our painted page what

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.360 
surface design for our painted page what
I've<00:00:10.020> done<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.320> I've<00:00:10.440> taken<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.799> larger<00:00:11.160> sheet

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I've done is I've taken the larger sheet

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.799 
I've done is I've taken the larger sheet
and<00:00:11.610> I've<00:00:11.670> made<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.879> smaller<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.540> make<00:00:12.690> it

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and I've made it smaller to make it

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.510 
and I've made it smaller to make it
easier<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.170> work<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.889> I'm<00:00:14.279> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.459> be

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
easier to work on and I'm going to be

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.359 
easier to work on and I'm going to be
showing<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.910> some<00:00:15.119> low-tech<00:00:15.830> strategies<00:00:16.830> for

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
showing you some low-tech strategies for

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.730 
showing you some low-tech strategies for
adding<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:17.910> surface<00:00:18.510> design<00:00:19.170> elements

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
adding a lot of surface design elements

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
adding a lot of surface design elements
to<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> page<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.550> make<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.699> much<00:00:20.939> more

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to the page to make it much more

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790 
to the page to make it much more
interesting<00:00:21.330> when<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.230> ultimately<00:00:22.619> make

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
interesting when you ultimately make

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.009 
interesting when you ultimately make
your<00:00:22.949> collage<00:00:23.330> we're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.509> be<00:00:24.630> using

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
your collage we're going to be using

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.989 
your collage we're going to be using
first<00:00:25.349> the<00:00:25.949> same<00:00:26.160> sheets<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.669> embossed

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:26.999 
first the same sheets of embossed

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.120 
first the same sheets of embossed
wallpaper<00:00:27.509> that<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.839> use<00:00:28.019> before<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.980> we're

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
wallpaper that we use before but we're

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.050 
wallpaper that we use before but we're
going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.400> using<00:00:29.730> them<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> different

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to be using them in a different

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.710 
going to be using them in a different
way<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.679> earlier<00:00:31.980> version<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
way in the earlier version of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.660 
way in the earlier version of
texturising<00:00:33.720> what<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.560> did<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> added<00:00:35.220> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
texturising what I did was I added the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.550 
texturising what I did was I added the
gesso<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> paper<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.060> impressed

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
gesso to the paper and then I impressed

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.860 
gesso to the paper and then I impressed
the<00:00:40.560> design<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.610> page<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.720> going<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the design into the page we're going to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
the design into the page we're going to
work<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.740> different<00:00:44.070> way<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.220> we<00:00:44.520> are

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
work it in a different way but we are

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
work it in a different way but we are
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:44.970> back<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.150> gesso<00:00:45.690> first<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
going to go back to gesso first and what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.470 
going to go back to gesso first and what
I'm<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.820> pour<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
I'm going to do is just pour out a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.390 
I'm going to do is just pour out a
little<00:00:48.720> bit<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.410> my<00:00:49.530> palette<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> don't<00:00:50.250> need

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
little bit on my palette I don't need

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.360 
little bit on my palette I don't need
much<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.880> this<00:00:51.000> step<00:00:51.830> and<00:00:52.830> I'm<00:00:52.950> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> use

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
much for this step and I'm going to use

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
much for this step and I'm going to use
these<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.510> stamps<00:00:55.380> I'm<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> cover<00:00:57.420> my

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
these as stamps I'm going to cover my

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.080 
these as stamps I'm going to cover my
brush<00:00:57.930> lightly<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.490> not<00:00:59.610> want<00:00:59.670> much

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
brush lightly I really do not want much

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.350 
brush lightly I really do not want much
much<00:01:00.900> gesso<00:01:01.380> on<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.790> going<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.150> just

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
much gesso on this and I'm going to just

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.859 
much gesso on this and I'm going to just
make<00:01:03.990> sure<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.530> cover<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> surface

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
make sure that I cover the surface

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.889 
make sure that I cover the surface
evenly<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.250> any<00:01:08.430> blotchy<00:01:08.899> paint

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
evenly I do not want any blotchy paint

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.830 
evenly I do not want any blotchy paint
pooling<00:01:10.679> up<00:01:10.829> inside<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> texture<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> then

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
pooling up inside the texture and then

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.340 
pooling up inside the texture and then
I'm<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.289> to<00:01:13.939> impress<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.179> on<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.929> this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I'm going to impress it on here in this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
I'm going to impress it on here in this
case<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.770> am<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.310> hand<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:17.999> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
case I am going to use my hand and not a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.639 
case I am going to use my hand and not a
brayer<00:01:18.329> because<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.109> really<00:01:19.380> want

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
brayer because I don't really want

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.880 
brayer because I don't really want
anything<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.579> looks<00:01:20.969> too<00:01:21.869> rigid<00:01:22.770> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
anything that looks too rigid or

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.749 
anything that looks too rigid or
standard<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.569> random

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
standard I want this to be very random

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.840 
standard I want this to be very random
and<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.359> we've<00:01:27.990> begun<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.289> create

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
and you can see we've begun to create

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.849 
and you can see we've begun to create
some<00:01:29.850> different<00:01:30.299> texture<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> certainly

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
some different texture now you certainly

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.160 
some different texture now you certainly
can<00:01:32.159> use<00:01:32.189> white<00:01:32.549> paint<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.479> again<00:01:33.719> I'm<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.899> fan

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
can use white paint but again I'm a fan

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.609 
can use white paint but again I'm a fan
of<00:01:34.200> gesso<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.389> use<00:01:36.539> it<00:01:36.689> wherever<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.139> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of gesso and I use it wherever I can and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.919 
of gesso and I use it wherever I can and
I<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.609> picks<00:01:38.999> up<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.389> white<00:01:39.569> gesso

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
I like that it picks up the white gesso

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.129 
I like that it picks up the white gesso
that<00:01:40.380> shows<00:01:40.740> through<00:01:41.039> our<00:01:41.520> original<00:01:42.210> wash<00:01:42.450> I'm

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:43.139 
that shows through our original wash I'm

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:44.419 
that shows through our original wash I'm
going<00:01:43.319> to<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.499> a<00:01:43.530> couple<00:01:43.829> other<00:01:44.069> of<00:01:44.159> these

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
going to use a couple other of these

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.950 
going to use a couple other of these
just<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.969> get<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.270> bit<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.659> different

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
just to get a little bit of a different

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.730 
just to get a little bit of a different
effect<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.929> one<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.139> the<00:01:49.200> things<00:01:49.439> you'll<00:01:49.560> see

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
effect and one of the things you'll see

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.760 
effect and one of the things you'll see
is<00:01:49.950> mostly<00:01:50.429> I'm<00:01:50.549> swiping<00:01:51.200> again<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.499> press

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
is mostly I'm swiping again if you press

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
we're going to put this aside and I'm

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.720 
we're going to put this aside and I'm
going<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.359> show<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.600> another<00:03:54.989> low-tech

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
going to show you another low-tech

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.509 
going to show you another low-tech
strategy<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:57.569> adding<00:03:58.049> these<00:03:58.500> surface<00:03:59.190> design

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
strategy for adding these surface design

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.670 
strategy for adding these surface design
elements<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.180> your<00:04:00.299> paper<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.349> with<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
elements to your paper and that's with a

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.069 
elements to your paper and that's with a
book<00:04:02.069> board<00:04:02.340> now<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.060> use<00:04:03.329> this<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.840> making

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
book board now I use this for making

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.229 
book board now I use this for making
books<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> have<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:05.849> lot<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.060> this

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
books but and so I have a lot of this

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.580 
books but and so I have a lot of this
around<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> have<00:04:07.049> these<00:04:07.139> little<00:04:07.290> pieces

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
around and I have these little pieces

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.710 
around and I have these little pieces
and<00:04:07.859> I<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.430> use<00:04:08.549> all<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.849> pieces<00:04:09.359> of

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
and I like to use all the pieces of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.259 
and I like to use all the pieces of
extra<00:04:10.620> stuff<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.099> in<00:04:11.280> my<00:04:11.370> studio<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.239> you

get in the mail you really can use any
surface<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.750> I'm<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:18.989> going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.229> be<00:04:19.320> using

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
surface and I'm just going to be using

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.949 
surface and I'm just going to be using
the<00:04:19.680> edge<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.639> create<00:04:20.940> different<00:04:21.120> lines<00:04:21.570> in

the edge to create different lines in

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.230 
the edge to create different lines in
different<00:04:22.169> directions<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.099> page<00:04:23.240> I'm

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
different directions on this page I'm

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.659 
different directions on this page I'm
going<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> start<00:04:24.870> I'm<00:04:25.110> actually<00:04:25.530> going<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> not

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
going to start I'm actually going to not

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.339 
going to start I'm actually going to not
even<00:04:26.820> use<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.060> brush<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.510> this<00:04:27.659> one<00:04:27.870> I'm<00:04:28.289> going

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
even use a brush for this one I'm going

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.649 
even use a brush for this one I'm going
to<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:28.940> take<00:04:29.940> this<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.270> I'm<00:04:30.330> going<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> rub

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
to just take this and I'm going to rub

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.200 
to just take this and I'm going to rub
it<00:04:30.690> into<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> paint<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:31.349> I<00:04:31.409> already<00:04:31.530> have

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
it into the paint that I already have

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.880 
it into the paint that I already have
I'm<00:04:32.450> going<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.870> press<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.260> on<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.470> pallet<00:04:33.830> a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
I'm going to press it on the pallet a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.680 
I'm going to press it on the pallet a
few<00:04:34.070> times<00:04:34.250> because<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.610> do<00:04:34.670> not<00:04:35.210> want<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.510> line

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
few times because I do not want a line

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.810 
few times because I do not want a line
that<00:04:35.900> looks<00:04:36.110> like<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.800> want<00:04:37.220> again<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.490> more

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
that looks like that I want again a more

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that looks like that I want again a more
a<00:04:38.030> more<00:04:38.270> subtle<00:04:38.780> line<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:41.030> was<00:04:41.210> so

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
a more subtle line and that was so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.210 
a more subtle line and that was so
little<00:04:42.020> paint<00:04:42.350> it's<00:04:42.530> just<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.770> little<00:04:42.980> bit<00:04:43.100> too

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
little paint it's just a little bit too

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.510 
little paint it's just a little bit too
subtle<00:04:43.460> for<00:04:43.610> me<00:04:43.850> I'm<00:04:44.420> going<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.660> go<00:04:44.750> back<00:04:48.520> and

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
subtle for me I'm going to go back and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.500 
subtle for me I'm going to go back and
I'm<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:49.730> going<00:04:49.850> to<00:04:49.910> mix<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.330> up<00:04:50.480> like<00:04:50.570> that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
I'm just going to mix it up like that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.990 
I'm just going to mix it up like that
maybe<00:04:53.510> make<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.750> grid<00:04:54.140> again<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.520> do<00:04:55.700> not<00:04:55.820> need

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
maybe make a grid again you do not need

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.450 
maybe make a grid again you do not need
to<00:04:56.210> worry<00:04:56.450> at<00:04:56.780> all<00:04:57.020> about<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.770> placement<00:04:58.310> you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
to worry at all about the placement you

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.640 
to worry at all about the placement you
just<00:04:58.820> want<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.120> get<00:04:59.210> color<00:04:59.480> but<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.230> want<00:05:00.290> a<00:05:00.440> lot

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
just want to get color but I want a lot

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.970 
just want to get color but I want a lot
more<00:05:00.830> contrast<00:05:01.310> than<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:02.680> because<00:05:03.680> I<00:05:03.800> have<00:05:03.950> a

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
more contrast than that because I have a

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.980 
more contrast than that because I have a
plenty<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.400> that<00:05:04.580> orange<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.540> I'm<00:05:05.660> going<00:05:05.900> to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
plenty of that orange so I'm going to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.750 
plenty of that orange so I'm going to
now<00:05:06.110> add<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> different<00:05:06.590> color<00:05:06.800> I'm<00:05:07.520> going<00:05:07.670> to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
now add a different color I'm going to

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.760 
now add a different color I'm going to
go<00:05:07.850> back<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.360> one<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:08.930> my<00:05:09.020> favorites<00:05:09.440> Payne's

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
go back to one of my favorites Payne's

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.490 
go back to one of my favorites Payne's
gray<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.840> I'm<00:05:11.840> going<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.020> do<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.260> same<00:05:12.470> thing

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
gray and I'm going to do the same thing

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.690 
gray and I'm going to do the same thing
and<00:05:15.500> maybe<00:05:15.530> I'm<00:05:15.860> going<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.040> cross<00:05:16.310> some<00:05:16.520> of<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
and maybe I'm going to cross some of the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.120 
and maybe I'm going to cross some of the
some<00:05:17.420> of<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.570> burn<00:05:17.750> orange<00:05:18.140> maybe<00:05:18.740> I'll<00:05:18.920> place

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
some of the burn orange maybe I'll place

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.790 
some of the burn orange maybe I'll place
it<00:05:19.340> in<00:05:19.930> sections<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.080> don't<00:05:21.290> have<00:05:21.380> any<00:05:21.530> color

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
it in sections that don't have any color

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.380 
it in sections that don't have any color
at<00:05:22.010> all<00:05:22.100> yet<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.710> as<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.580> do<00:05:28.640> this<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.030> can<00:05:29.060> see

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
at all yet and as I do this I can see

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.320 
at all yet and as I do this I can see
that<00:05:29.560> my<00:05:30.560> page<00:05:30.800> is<00:05:30.980> filling<00:05:31.310> up<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.700> I'm<00:05:32.090> not

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
that my page is filling up and I'm not

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.260 
that my page is filling up and I'm not
left<00:05:32.690> with<00:05:32.900> too<00:05:33.140> much<00:05:33.380> blank<00:05:34.190> space<00:05:34.640> what<00:05:35.240> I

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
left with too much blank space what I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.150 
left with too much blank space what I
don't<00:05:35.600> want<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:36.140> too<00:05:36.320> much<00:05:36.470> area<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:36.950> looks

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
don't want is too much area that looks

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.100
