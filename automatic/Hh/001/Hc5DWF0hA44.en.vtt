00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.240
 hey loading net welcome to a new one 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.099
 tutorial on this tutorial friborg 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.810
 Today I want to script you the change 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.519
 introduce mod as the name 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.619
 says it gets one with this 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.199
 chainsaw in the game with the course 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.519
 then powerful could kill people and 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.169
 I want to show you how to do that 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.849
 installs and uses the first one 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.880
 we need to load through the we 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.179
 finally on gta 4 monster com link weber 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 and with a description of the country 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.809
 down and then when you unpack 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.629
 we have only times two folders and 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.070
 a beer is needed at the moment 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.780
 moment actually not because I equal 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.899
 so everything you need to know you have to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.609
 However , we do not see any windows opening 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.190
 put off that we need there 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.870
 from a script folder provided you 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.429
 of course an asylum or scriptor 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.569
 but should have installed 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.699
 his case if you for example a 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.550
 simple game or if you are 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.600
 used the murder 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.280
 otherwise it would not be easy files 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.619
 select the appropriate ones here too 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.500
 Skripte dnl out of the way for the right one 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.079
 patch and just go into gt4 order 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.460
 Put in four folders here and you 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.960
 the whole thing should work as well 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.579
 we just need this script 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.500
 folder we go in our scripts 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.200
 folders have to change or if 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.579
 her did not you just here to 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 individually 3 copy 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.110
 I come to these files and the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.820
 folder about it and then actually 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.680
 even if you look in here 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.719
 one has with the fans we have here 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.549
 first the sound and here once such 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.100
 Blood effects over the screen 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.930
 you can also replace yourself 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.920
 how you want any and then it was 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.450
 that actually synonymous with the script 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.159
 installation there we have to go 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.490
 insert model that is called this here 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.149
 chainsaw model and location we need 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.920
 open 4 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.969
 because the offender should also be theoretical 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 also installed if not 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.490
 just download the technical 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.649
 data using cd images and here in the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.619
 wilkens points img Click on the 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.030
 parent courage yes of course and by drag 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.290
 and drop here we can see that the 2010 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.350
 and then just give me one 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.150
 and ponder 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.740
 and yes , I always have to do that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.600
 i should like to safety 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 so that everything fits that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 even with the installation if we 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.430
 start our gta 4 then we start 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.120
 our gta 4 and i will show you in the game 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.500
 how it goes then so I'm next 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.620
 play here if you see here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.150
 Of course, and chainsaw too 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.980
 get that press that easy 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.400
 fit 0 out 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 and if the model is not that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.370
 most beautiful thing there is also there 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.990
 sure to come soon better and he 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.540
 of course has a lot to do except go there 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.760
 and fast first the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.020
 chain saw was actually automatic 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.020
 overrun after living here 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.100
 The cars can also be here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.100
 break something 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.040
 more here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.550
 he knows his way around 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 the left mouse button not only 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.370
 unsettle 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.580
 league get something here too 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.580
 do 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.959
 but in the end most of it 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.470
 happens automatically and it was 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.470
 great something 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.870
 which is also a very cool feature on the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.270
 Whole is when we are a motorcycle here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.830
 take everything fast you can tell 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.340
 for two chainsaws and can here 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.710
 will drive nice on both here too 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.920
 on the last ten vehicles 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.920
 represent 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.780
 which not to take on the sound 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:25.759
 beautiful season therefore not but who knows 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.539
 maybe you could do it better though 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.620
 it all sounds to each other 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.870
 chainsaw to less how should you look 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.270
 also good blood effects this time have 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.400
 full of pictures of the well on screen 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.840
 who does not want to do that, I believe you 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.560
 Can wake up 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.610
 I think I will perform 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.610
 not even expressly said 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:54.449
 but the blood effects i do not have the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.889
 most beautiful but that is true in itself 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.050
 each case very short on the models 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.669
 Anyway, I think I can get in 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.650
 strikes should still work a bit 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.909
 or he has in the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.150
 possibility left that one open here 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:14.659
 her goes and goes and other models 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.789
 The whole thing can be inserted anyway 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.440
 such exhibition is all this way 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.440
 there is not so closed 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.560
 press zero then come the chainsaw 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.260
 So nice stagger the beautiful day 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.900
 the cool idea for in between or 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.160
 bring chain saws 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.070
 we almost thought because immortal 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.650
 you are not anyway 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.130
 yes but definitely kolomak like 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.700
 me very good 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.150
 to hire a little here in here 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.310
 Luebnitz yes, there are, I think 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.930
 not to say that was as far as I hope 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.370
 everything was clearly understandable and 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.120
 otherwise wish much fun while gambling 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.120
 until yours
