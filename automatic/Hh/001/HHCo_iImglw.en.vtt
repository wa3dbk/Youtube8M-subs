are gonna start with the most important
part<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> fridge<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.420> gotta<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
part it is the fridge you gotta have a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
balanced diet so we have a fridge in the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.759 
balanced diet so we have a fridge in the
room<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.240> there's<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.960> very<00:00:30.990> balanced

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
