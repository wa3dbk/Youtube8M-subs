with the next code you see this little

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
with the next code you see this little
spot<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> that's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
spot right here which is a that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
I put on it the more it will exaggerate

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.390 
I put on it the more it will exaggerate
that<00:01:12.600> spot<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.100> rest<00:01:14.220> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
going to have to repaint it that's all

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.729 
going to have to repaint it that's all
there<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> suggest<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
there is to it so what I suggest is you

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.830 
there is to it so what I suggest is you
take<00:02:10.739> your<00:02:10.770> pad<00:02:11.129> over<00:02:11.730> here

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
take your pad over here

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.670 
take your pad over here
and<00:02:13.340> use<00:02:14.340> warm<00:02:14.640> water<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.030> soap<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:16.410> soap

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
and use warm water and soap the soap

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.559 
and use warm water and soap the soap
would<00:02:17.069> actually<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.760> acts<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.209> cleaner

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
would actually it acts like a cleaner

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.710 
would actually it acts like a cleaner
and<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.590> acts<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.040> lubricant<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.629> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and it acts like a lubricant so that you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
and it acts like a lubricant so that you

take<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.440> off<00:04:46.590> leave<00:04:46.890> it<00:04:47.040> alone<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:48.270> right

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
take it off leave it alone this right

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.390 
take it off leave it alone this right
here<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.140> where<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.350> nicked<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:49.920> on<00:04:50.040> something

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
here is where I nicked it on something

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.280 
here is where I nicked it on something
but<00:04:51.030> you'll<00:04:51.240> notice<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.660> edges<00:04:51.960> right<00:04:52.080> here

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
but you'll notice the edges right here

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.400 
but you'll notice the edges right here
right<00:04:52.650> along<00:04:52.860> here<00:04:53.340> all<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.000> way<00:04:54.030> down<00:04:54.300> here

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
right along here all the way down here

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:03.550 
right along here all the way down here
the<00:04:55.410> edges<00:04:55.940> right<00:04:56.940> along<00:04:57.710> here<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.690> in<00:05:00.690> here

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.260 

another<00:05:04.560> thing<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:05.220> we<00:05:05.250> have<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.580> look<00:05:05.820> at<00:05:06.000> is

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
another thing that we have to look at is

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.750 
another thing that we have to look at is
that<00:05:06.590> what<00:05:07.590> is<00:05:07.680> going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.890> show<00:05:08.130> on<00:05:08.340> what's<00:05:08.550> not

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
that what is going to show on what's not

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.750 
that what is going to show on what's not
going<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.060> show<00:05:09.860> right<00:05:10.860> here<00:05:11.220> is<00:05:11.430> where<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
going to show right here is where the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.450 
going to show right here is where the
exhaust<00:05:12.060> comes<00:05:12.630> out<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.280> bike

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
exhaust comes out of the of the bike

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.520 
exhaust comes out of the of the bike
comes<00:05:14.820> out<00:05:14.970> like<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:16.110> goes<00:05:16.260> right

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
comes out like this and it goes right

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.340 
comes out like this and it goes right
along<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:17.400> edge<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.390> I<00:05:18.420> know<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.990> all<00:05:19.110> this

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
along this edge so I know that all this

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.710 
along this edge so I know that all this
isn't<00:05:19.710> going<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.860> show<00:05:20.180> this<00:05:21.180> may<00:05:21.450> show<00:05:21.690> a

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
isn't going to show this may show a

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.780 
isn't going to show this may show a
little<00:05:21.960> bit<00:05:22.110> right<00:05:22.320> here<00:05:22.350> but<00:05:23.340> this<00:05:23.490> will<00:05:23.760> not

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
little bit right here but this will not

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.300 
little bit right here but this will not
therefore<00:05:24.740> i'm<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:25.980> going<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.160> worry<00:05:26.280> about

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
therefore i'm not going to worry about

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.410 
therefore i'm not going to worry about
this<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.790> much<00:05:27.080> because<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:30.120> an<00:05:30.270> optical

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
this that much because it's an optical

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.420 
this that much because it's an optical
illusion<00:05:30.720> as<00:05:31.320> you're<00:05:31.680> looking<00:05:31.980> at<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.250> right

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
illusion as you're looking at it right

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.570 
illusion as you're looking at it right
now<00:05:32.930> but<00:05:33.930> when<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:37.200> bike<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.800> I'll<00:05:38.190> go<00:05:38.340> put

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
now but when the bike and I'll go put

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.409 
now but when the bike and I'll go put
this<00:05:38.670> over<00:05:38.850> on<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.710> on<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.090> got<00:05:42.090> this<00:05:42.210> cool

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.940 
this over on the on the got this cool
light<00:05:43.310> I'll<00:05:44.310> put<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:44.640> I'll<00:05:44.940> put<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:45.540> on<00:05:45.750> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
light I'll put this I'll put this on the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.330 
light I'll put this I'll put this on the
on<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> bike<00:05:47.550> okay<00:05:48.590> when<00:05:49.590> you're<00:05:49.800> looking<00:05:50.160> at

on the bike okay when you're looking at

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.740 
on the bike okay when you're looking at
the<00:05:50.610> at<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.030> at<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.810> bike<00:05:53.510> the<00:05:54.510> main<00:05:54.720> thing

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
the at the at the bike the main thing

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.840 
the at the at the bike the main thing
was<00:05:55.169> just<00:05:55.410> going<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.680> show<00:05:55.890> is<00:05:56.130> all<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.610> flat
