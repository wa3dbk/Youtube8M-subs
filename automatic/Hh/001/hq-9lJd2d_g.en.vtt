00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 hi this is the case of the team tuning and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 we find ourselves still today 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.039
 a little video on black ops of 1 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.240
 discover the cause of it is there I 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 finally know the title and we will try 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.529
 I say try because it's a 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.859
 little bit long we will say we try to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.410
 make small episode packs loaded 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.000
 so I think it's going to be really 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 short 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 simply because already the part 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 there I struggled to find it I put in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 minus 5 minutes five minutes during 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 the roof during the five minutes 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.260
 the trick he turned into the void 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.750
 found a part 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 so we will try to at least in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 do two knowing that part of it is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.719
 really race had to join two 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 minutes then for those who know 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.550
 not the principle of basel charged at wholesale 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 we have a pistol so finally pistol 7 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.470
 cac 40 with a single ball in it when 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.909
 we shoot more bullets if we do not kill 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 of enemies baala fouteballe and sciences 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 human and a half with the ball there is a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 ball that come back in and if we kill 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.840
 a guy with a knife we ​​get a ball 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.180
 we see it and we have it I think it's 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 three lives so if we die three times 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.540
 after three times after 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.509
 that we have even died three 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.110
 times long and low have already appeared 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.600
 over there we are on stand up and well 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.930
 this card but I do not know the hold 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 up 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 good it starts well I do not know the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.180
 hula hoop telly is shot in addition she 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.950
 could give me bullets to mr so 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.320
 you two of them on it before me no 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.460
 knowing he has a ball here he is 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:13.140
 past yes here we are on five in a row 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:14.550
 that's it oh well it's not if you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.069
 have heard because mounting and the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.660
 music 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 there is a guy who sang a child I 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 do not know I bought without a child a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.200
 girl no shit that we slaughter late I'll 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.660
 teach you to hide in your boots 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.769
 hay from the control areas I was 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.879
 maybe saying something that 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.900
 the top what put me in because the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.300
 problem finally the problem 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 you will be in this cool shit actually c 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.900
 fair 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.739
 the problem is that ya the radar 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.269
 always active 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.599
 but I have more than 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.120
 old should not I stay that 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:02.519
 keeps there radars always active 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.489
 mr two mats there a ball him what 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.420
 you can not take the enemies 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.340
 from behind in everything well all honor 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.120
 if I can say remove these passionate 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:19.170
 a ball he has a ball he has a ball 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:20.610
 time to pul seemingly to stick so 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.000
 yeah rattle arthur active and dangerous 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.810
 of weapons also the s that I have to do the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.220
 small areas which I'm afraid 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 the episode of weapons game to make 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.260
 there it's finished 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.530
 a small victory really happened 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.970
 want to josé dias did what it does 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.180
 it must be two minutes three minutes 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.260
 to break everything en route and I won in 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.040
 laugh there who tell me are you gonna be dead 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.959
 why did you win 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.489
 in fact it's done full we have 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.590
 three lives to make the most of 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.790
 points, and then once it dies down 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.560
 we play more and others can 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.599
 continue to make points here I have 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.830
 do the 7 3 with a stab and 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.189
 it would not survive what's the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.709
 listen survival 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.810
 so expensive in two seconds ahead at 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.579
 to listen to it is not even an acquired 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.849
 who saw him there leaving 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.930
 already so what we're going to do is so 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.670
 we'll meet right now I'll 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.599
 cut and then will end up all of 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.170
 next may be that it's the last 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.340
 episode 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.889
 I think not I will still in 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.129
 ferrain and then we'll stop at everything from 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.120
 after 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.120
 good here 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.100
 October is not bad and it has changed 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.410
 his house is actually all left 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.180
 his spare and so we end up there 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.440
 on a nokta I was trying to 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.110
 to say something that in my opinion I was speaking 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 radar still active 5 e or again 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.430
 when and in the cloud and brake sticks 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.780
 episode in Kabyle stick when you're in 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.199
 pebbles and sticks that you are in basel 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.930
 charge 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.870
 it's good because well it's something 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.880
 really fun you're biting a bit of a 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.820
 little to win or what and as it's a 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 where you tend to play a bit 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.180
 life there was no radar all the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.070
 world includes a loaded ball my 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.600
 arthur grade assets severely stakes 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.400
 weapons is a little broken balls this 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.840
 that guys who know where you are and that 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.810
 on the other hand the game of weapons I prefer 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.160
 largely on ghost because precisely 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.550
 there is no radar and fucking that 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.550
 starts well 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.270
 there is no radar and have nice game 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.650
 when I prefer that hop 1 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.680
 there are some who were behind you 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.680
 saw my coco ouh there is the world 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:33.960

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.300

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:50.220

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:53.570
 go we do not break flat there are 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.570
 words like that it's anything 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.690
 often towards the end it's like that more 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.009
 person with two balls everyone gets 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.190
 found in the middle of the map and its 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:08.410
 share in stab wounds then I think 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.669
 that you know to fucking here is the bomba 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.020

 made the mistake of Easter to shoot after 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.960
 summer maybe it was maybe 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.090
