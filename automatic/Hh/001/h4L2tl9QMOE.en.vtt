00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
when I wasn't punching mats and I was

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.050 
when I wasn't punching mats and I was
still<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> areas<00:01:43.340> where<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.520> felt<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.880> big

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
still in the areas where I felt the big

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.490 
still in the areas where I felt the big
fish<00:01:44.300> work<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.750> some<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.170> them<00:01:45.290> were<00:01:45.350> actually

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
fish work and some of them were actually

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.230 
fish work and some of them were actually
spawning<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.400> couldn't<00:01:46.670> see<00:01:46.910> him<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
spawning but you couldn't see him and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.310 
spawning but you couldn't see him and

but this rod right here is extremely
lightweight<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.540> could<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:19.959> use<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.319> like

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
lightweight and I could just use it like

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.680 
lightweight and I could just use it like
an<00:02:20.739> all-purpose<00:02:21.310> type<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.760> casting<00:02:22.150> rod<00:02:22.360> and

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
they blew a little bit on day 1 but I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.660 
they blew a little bit on day 1 but I
was<00:03:38.380> able<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.590> get<00:03:38.739> into<00:03:38.889> these<00:03:39.100> areas<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.519> out

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
was able to get into these areas and out

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.670 
was able to get into these areas and out
power<00:03:39.970> pull<00:03:40.269> down<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.109> could<00:03:41.260> be<00:03:41.350> really

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
power pull down and I could be really

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.590 
power pull down and I could be really
really<00:03:41.709> quiet<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.819> can<00:03:42.850> make<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.269> exact

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
really quiet and I can make the exact

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.970 
really quiet and I can make the exact
flips<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:44.139> wanted<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.560> make<00:03:44.739> where<00:03:44.950> I

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
flips that I wanted to make where I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.500 
flips that I wanted to make where I
thought<00:03:45.160> those<00:03:45.370> big<00:03:45.579> fish<00:03:45.819> were<00:03:45.970> hanging<00:03:46.329> and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
thought those big fish were hanging and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.479 
thought those big fish were hanging and
bring<00:03:47.049> them<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> boat<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.280> think

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
bring them to the boat and I think

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.890 
bring them to the boat and I think
without<00:03:48.579> my<00:03:48.819> power<00:03:49.090> poles<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.510> probably

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
without my power poles I probably

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.330 
without my power poles I probably
wouldn't<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.290> had<00:03:50.380> even<00:03:50.620> opportunity<00:03:51.220> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
wouldn't have had even opportunity to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.559 
wouldn't have had even opportunity to
catch<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.670> type<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.970> fish<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.389> caught

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569
