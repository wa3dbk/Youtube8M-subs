today<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:42.410> know<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.680> pullback

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
today and you know with the pullback

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.350 
today and you know with the pullback
that<00:02:43.370> we've<00:02:43.490> seen<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.910> quite<00:02:44.120> an<00:02:44.240> opportunity

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
that we've seen is quite an opportunity

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.870 
that we've seen is quite an opportunity
and<00:02:45.110> we<00:02:45.560> expect<00:02:45.920> gold<00:02:46.160> prices<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.580> be<00:02:46.610> higher

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
and we expect gold prices to be higher

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.690 
and we expect gold prices to be higher
going<00:02:47.240> forward<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.260> this<00:02:48.770> is<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:48.950> time<00:02:49.250> when<00:02:49.490> we

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
going forward so this is a time when we

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520 
going forward so this is a time when we
ourselves<00:02:49.850> are<00:02:50.300> trying<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.600> get<00:02:50.720> more<00:02:50.959> so

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
ourselves are trying to get more so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.380 
ourselves are trying to get more so

looking at within the next six months
well<00:04:00.019> we<00:04:00.560> think<00:04:00.680> olds<00:04:00.980> more<00:04:01.160> likely<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.580> go<00:04:01.700> up

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
well we think olds more likely to go up

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.630 
well we think olds more likely to go up
and<00:04:02.000> go<00:04:02.150> down<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.680> know<00:04:03.769> we're<00:04:04.430> actually

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
and go down you know we're actually

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.090 
and go down you know we're actually
pretty<00:04:04.970> comfortable<00:04:05.269> because<00:04:05.780> even<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.739> where

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
pretty comfortable because even it where

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.470 
pretty comfortable because even it where
gold<00:04:07.430> prices<00:04:07.640> are<00:04:07.820> today<00:04:08.060> we're<00:04:08.209> generating

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
gold prices are today we're generating

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.120 
gold prices are today we're generating
margins<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.080> five<00:04:09.290> hundred<00:04:09.590> dollars<00:04:09.860> an<00:04:10.010> ounce

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
margins of five hundred dollars an ounce

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.580 
margins of five hundred dollars an ounce
I<00:04:10.400> think<00:04:10.910> 2014<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:11.989> going<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.200> be<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:12.350> really

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
I think 2014 is going to be a really

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.740 
I think 2014 is going to be a really
good<00:04:12.860> year<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:13.280> gold<00:04:13.519> we've<00:04:14.299> already<00:04:14.480> seen<00:04:14.690> a

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
good year for gold we've already seen a

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.090 
good year for gold we've already seen a
nice<00:04:14.959> start<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.470> year<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.860> think<00:04:15.950> we're

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
nice start to the year but I think we're

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.469 
nice start to the year but I think we're
going<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.280> finish<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.609> lot<00:04:16.850> higher<00:04:17.030> than<00:04:17.090> where

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
going to finish a lot higher than where

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.880 
going to finish a lot higher than where
we<00:04:17.630> are<00:04:17.660> today<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.260> when<00:04:18.380> we<00:04:18.500> say<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.709> lot

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
we are today and when we say a lot

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.920 
we are today and when we say a lot
higher<00:04:19.539> hundreds<00:04:20.539> of<00:04:20.660> dollars

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
higher hundreds of dollars

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.960 
higher hundreds of dollars
so<00:04:22.259> we<00:04:22.800> talked<00:04:22.979> two<00:04:23.190> thousand<00:04:23.550> dollar<00:04:23.669> gold

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so we talked two thousand dollar gold

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.730 
so we talked two thousand dollar gold
does<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.360> crazy<00:04:24.630> idea<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.259> I<00:04:25.470> don't

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
does that crazy idea for you I don't

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.850 
does that crazy idea for you I don't
think<00:04:25.889> it's<00:04:25.979> out<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.310> question<00:04:26.630> we

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
think it's out of the question we

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
think it's out of the question we
markets<00:04:28.860> don't<00:04:29.070> move<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.430> one<00:04:29.639> direction<00:04:29.810> we

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
markets don't move in one direction we

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.020 
markets don't move in one direction we
saw<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.620> know<00:04:31.680> when<00:04:31.860> gold<00:04:32.100> ran<00:04:32.639> up<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
saw you know when gold ran up in the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.150 
saw you know when gold ran up in the
1970s<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.930> pulled<00:04:34.139> back<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.500> think<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.830> forty

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
1970s it pulled back I think about forty

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.710 
1970s it pulled back I think about forty
six<00:04:35.370> percent<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.910> then<00:04:36.000> continued<00:04:36.449> to<00:04:36.509> go<00:04:36.660> to

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
six percent and then continued to go to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.290 
six percent and then continued to go to
record<00:04:37.110> highs<00:04:37.280> we've<00:04:38.280> had<00:04:38.460> we<00:04:38.639> had<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.850> pretty

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
record highs we've had we had a pretty

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180 
record highs we've had we had a pretty
good<00:04:39.389> 10<00:04:39.660> or<00:04:39.780> 12<00:04:39.990> years<00:04:40.229> in<00:04:40.289> gold<00:04:40.620> we<00:04:41.009> had<00:04:41.160> a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
good 10 or 12 years in gold we had a

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.890 
good 10 or 12 years in gold we had a
year<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.550> stepping<00:04:42.030> back<00:04:42.240> by<00:04:42.479> twenty<00:04:42.780> eight

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
year of stepping back by twenty eight

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.629 
year of stepping back by twenty eight
percent<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.830> think<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.250> we've<00:04:44.460> already

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
percent but I think that we've already

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.850 
percent but I think that we've already
seen<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.630> direction<00:04:45.990> has<00:04:46.229> changed<00:04:46.259> this<00:04:46.800> year

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
seen the direction has changed this year

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.800 
seen the direction has changed this year
and<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.850> don't<00:04:48.030> see<00:04:48.150> any<00:04:48.300> reason<00:04:48.330> why<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.690> can't

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
and I don't see any reason why we can't

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.080 
and I don't see any reason why we can't
go<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.169> new<00:04:49.380> records<00:04:49.740> on<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.580> note<00:04:50.759> Randall
