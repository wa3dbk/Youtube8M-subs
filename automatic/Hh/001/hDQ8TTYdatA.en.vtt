account<00:04:16.100> what<00:04:17.100> what<00:04:17.489> we<00:04:17.610> have<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.480> we

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
account what what we have to do is we

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.500 
account what what we have to do is we
actually<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.500> start<00:04:19.770> an<00:04:19.860> order<00:04:20.360> so<00:04:21.360> let's

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
actually have to start an order so let's

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.610 
actually have to start an order so let's
go<00:04:21.630> ahead<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.870> do<00:04:22.110> delivery<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:25.970> because<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
go ahead and do delivery in because the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.370 
go ahead and do delivery in because the
pizza<00:04:28.620> hut<00:04:28.650> as<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.850> chain<00:04:30.690> does<00:04:30.990> not<00:04:31.170> offer

specials across all stores necessarily

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.840 
specials across all stores necessarily
because<00:04:33.930> every<00:04:34.320> store<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.070> independently

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
because every store is independently

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:54.480 
because every store is independently
owned<00:04:41.450> oops

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.219

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
and again this is pulling all the data

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.480 
and again this is pulling all the data
live<00:04:56.440> from<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.949> API<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.810> here's<00:04:59.490> popular

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
lonely there I believe they're other

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.740 
lonely there I believe they're other
apps<00:05:33.400> don't<00:05:33.639> actually<00:05:33.940> support<00:05:34.120> that<00:05:34.419> yet<00:05:34.539> oh

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
apps don't actually support that yet oh

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.600 
apps don't actually support that yet oh
uh<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.590> something<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:36.430> working<00:05:36.699> with<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:36.970> on

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
uh so something for working with that on

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.540 
uh so something for working with that on
and<00:05:39.610> also<00:05:40.259> we<00:05:41.259> do<00:05:41.440> take<00:05:41.620> into<00:05:41.830> account<00:05:42.039> so

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
and also we do take into account so

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.600 
and also we do take into account so
every<00:05:42.819> store<00:05:43.090> may<00:05:43.509> have<00:05:44.220> different<00:05:45.220> pricing

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
every store may have different pricing

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.749 
every store may have different pricing
so<00:05:46.180> if<00:05:46.509> you<00:05:46.810> for<00:05:47.229> example<00:05:47.430> like<00:05:48.430> there<00:05:48.610> was<00:05:48.729> a

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
so if you for example like there was a

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.659 
so if you for example like there was a
offer<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.479> while<00:05:49.659> ago<00:05:49.900> where<00:05:50.110> they<00:05:50.199> had<00:05:50.349> free

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
offer a while ago where they had free

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.370

breadsticks<00:05:51.669> with<00:05:52.150> women<00:05:52.569> were<00:05:52.690> placed<00:05:53.229> on

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
breadsticks with women were placed on

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.930 
breadsticks with women were placed on
one<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.620> their<00:05:53.740> apps<00:05:53.889> so<00:05:54.580> we<00:05:54.789> actually

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
one of their apps so we actually

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.560 
one of their apps so we actually
automatically<00:05:55.720> grab<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:57.120> bad<00:05:58.120> data<00:05:58.300> and

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
automatically grab that bad data and

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.170 
automatically grab that bad data and
that<00:05:58.659> special<00:05:59.110> so<00:05:59.620> if<00:05:59.710> you<00:05:59.800> order<00:06:00.099> pizza<00:06:00.909> and

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180
