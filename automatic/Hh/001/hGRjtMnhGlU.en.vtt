00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
companies now are doing over a lot

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
companies now are doing over a lot
thinner<00:01:54.210> chassis<00:01:54.780> over<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.890> do

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
thinner chassis over here I really do

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.240 
thinner chassis over here I really do
like<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> platform<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.450> big<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.560> has<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.009> lot

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like the platform it's big it has a lot

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
like the platform it's big it has a lot
of<00:01:59.280> space<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.350> being

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of space it's it's really not being

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.910 
of space it's it's really not being
occupied<00:02:01.799> by<00:02:02.070> much<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.549> can

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
occupied by much if you can

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.760 
occupied by much if you can
two<00:02:03.009> other<00:02:03.159> ones<00:02:03.400> like<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.909> SC<00:02:04.570> 10<00:02:04.810> from<00:02:05.560> team

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
two other ones like the SC 10 from team

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.130 
two other ones like the SC 10 from team
associated<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.820> see<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.119> one<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:07.420> has<00:02:07.570> very

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
associated you see this one it has very

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.749 
associated you see this one it has very
minimal<00:02:08.530> things<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:08.950> have<00:02:09.160> your<00:02:09.250> three

minimal things you just have your three

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.339 
minimal things you just have your three
little<00:02:10.119> electronic<00:02:10.599> components<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.260> you

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
little electronic components that you

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.600 
little electronic components that you
need<00:02:11.530> your<00:02:11.709> battery<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.190> middle<00:02:12.430> and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
need your battery in the middle and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.300 
need your battery in the middle and
that's<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:14.500> what<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.739> like<00:02:14.890> about<00:02:14.950> it

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
that's it that's what I like about it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.979 
that's it that's what I like about it
when<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.489> get<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> away<00:02:15.880> if<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> go<00:02:16.390> out<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
when you get it away if you go out you

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.780 
when you get it away if you go out you
can<00:02:17.380> wipe<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.680> off<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:17.950> three<00:02:18.160> seconds<00:02:18.610> it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
can wipe it off in three seconds it's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580 
can wipe it off in three seconds it's
done<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.360> won't<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.660> any<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:20.200> screws

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
wasted up fast if you use it on gravel a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.559 
wasted up fast if you use it on gravel a
lot<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:58.120> off-road<00:02:58.450> they're<00:02:59.019> pretty<00:02:59.230> good<00:02:59.470> um

have i've gone through a lot of brushed

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.310 
have i've gone through a lot of brushed
motors<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.870> best<00:03:17.049> ones

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
motors and this is one of the best ones

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.000 
motors and this is one of the best ones
that<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.680> prefer<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.370> any<00:03:18.700> vehicle<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.859> got

that I prefer on any vehicle you got

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.740 
that I prefer on any vehicle you got
your<00:03:21.130> antenna<00:03:21.459> inside<00:03:21.820> that's<00:03:22.030> always<00:03:22.510> good

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
your antenna inside that's always good

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.240 
your antenna inside that's always good
and<00:03:25.079> that's<00:03:26.079> really<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:26.859> got<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> lot<00:03:27.220> of

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
and that's really it you got a lot of

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.090 
and that's really it you got a lot of
plastic<00:03:27.519> everywhere<00:03:27.940> on<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.359> truck<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:29.100> got

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
plastic everywhere on the truck I got

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.520 
plastic everywhere on the truck I got
the<00:03:30.370> aluminum<00:03:30.910> pieces<00:03:31.180> over<00:03:31.570> here<00:03:31.840> because

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
the aluminum pieces over here because

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.349 
the aluminum pieces over here because
you<00:03:32.769> really<00:03:33.040> everything<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:33.640> smash<00:03:33.910> something

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
you really everything to smash something

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.300 
you really everything to smash something
you<00:03:34.660> really<00:03:34.959> take<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.590> good<00:03:35.709> chance<00:03:36.160> of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
you really take a good chance of

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.009 
you really take a good chance of
breaking<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.660> really<00:03:37.720> not<00:03:37.959> worth

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
breaking this and it's really not worth

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.539 
breaking this and it's really not worth
it<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.590> went<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.070> bought<00:03:39.280> those

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
it so I just went out and bought those

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.880 
it so I just went out and bought those
pieces<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.690> could<00:03:40.840> really<00:03:40.989> have<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> lot<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.620> a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
pieces so I could really have a lot of a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.280 
pieces so I could really have a lot of a
bit<00:03:42.400> more<00:03:42.549> strength<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.030> front<00:03:43.299> obviously

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
bit more strength in the front obviously

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.050 
bit more strength in the front obviously

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
servo and it's just I don't know it's

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.500 
servo and it's just I don't know it's
it's<00:04:04.870> too<00:04:05.079> weak<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.920> really<00:04:06.609> it's<00:04:07.299> really

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
it's too weak you really it's really

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.660 
it's too weak you really it's really
weak<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.989> really<00:04:08.260> mean

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
weak you really mean

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.140 
weak you really mean
better<00:04:09.290> circle<00:04:10.310> maybe<00:04:11.310> metal<00:04:11.670> they<00:04:11.849> make<00:04:12.030> an

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
better circle maybe metal they make an

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.240 
better circle maybe metal they make an
aluminum<00:04:12.720> piece<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:13.560> maybe<00:04:13.770> it'll

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
aluminum piece for this so maybe it'll

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
aluminum piece for this so maybe it'll
be<00:04:14.340> stronger<00:04:14.700> all<00:04:14.790> checked<00:04:15.000> out<00:04:15.320> getting<00:04:16.320> to

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
be stronger all checked out getting to

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650 
be stronger all checked out getting to
