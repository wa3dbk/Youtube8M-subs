00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.580

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.819
 having visual stimulation 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.110
 two 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.030
 put how many colors you want 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.580
 so that they too can be in 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.489
 the two colors and then what we're going to 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.150
 to do is join this part with a little 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.150
 of resistol 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.950
 and we're waiting for it to dry 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 and good at what dried as you can 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 here fold a little bit of these parts 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.340
 of the wings 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.379
 and will be ready to play with you 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.849
 imagination and that of your little one and that goes 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.220
 to also help the development more 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.409
 imagination remember that sometimes the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.870
 Imagination is more important 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.140
 knowledge good since it is 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.569
 ready 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.160
 I'm afraid I'll know if it's not in my spoon 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:42.510
 we are leaders of the amount 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.760
 it is there if they take the necessary measures 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.940
 so that you do not have a bigger part 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.310
 back of your spoon 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.510
 and there we have it ready now we are going to 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.510
 fold these wings 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.270
