00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
graphically I decided that 3d was the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
graphically I decided that 3d was the
way<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> future<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
way to go and it was the future so I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.600 
way to go and it was the future so I
always<00:02:01.350> wanted<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> stick<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> 3d<00:02:02.280> fighters

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
always wanted to stick to 3d fighters

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
always wanted to stick to 3d fighters

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.970 
form but no you can keep spamming it
until<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.000> 12<00:03:54.300> seconds<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.860> you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
until that 12 seconds is over but you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.170 
until that 12 seconds is over but you
have<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.190> know<00:03:56.310> when<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.550> use<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.940> move

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
have to know when to use this move

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.420 
have to know when to use this move
because<00:03:57.300> once<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.930> use<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.470> cannot<00:03:58.920> no

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
because once you use that you cannot no

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.000 
because once you use that you cannot no
longer<00:03:59.730> go<00:03:59.910> can<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.360> into<00:04:00.510> beast<00:04:00.840> mode<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.350> all

throughout<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.730> whole<00:04:02.880> fight<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.690> wouldn't

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
throughout the whole fight so I wouldn't

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.870 
throughout the whole fight so I wouldn't
normally<00:04:04.260> suggest<00:04:04.590> using<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:05.670> you're

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
normally suggest using it when you're

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.410 
normally suggest using it when you're
about<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.120> lose<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:07.080> on<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.500> know<00:04:08.420> 1111

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
about to lose it is one on you know 1111

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.360 
about to lose it is one on you know 1111
I<00:04:09.720> guess<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.020> around<00:04:10.260> count<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.280> have

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
I guess it around count and you have

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.590 
I guess it around count and you have
nothing<00:04:11.520> to<00:04:11.730> lose<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.209> just<00:04:12.390> thought

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
nothing to lose and then just thought

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.640 
nothing to lose and then just thought
let's<00:04:12.660> talk<00:04:12.840> about<00:04:12.959> their<00:04:13.200> try<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.470> win
