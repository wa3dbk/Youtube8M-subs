Smackdown<00:02:08.580> once<00:02:08.849> again<00:02:09.090> I've<00:02:09.209> said<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.509> a

Smackdown once again I've said this a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.420 
Smackdown once again I've said this a
million<00:02:10.140> times<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.679> was<00:02:10.800> once<00:02:11.099> regarded

million times it was once regarded

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
million times it was once regarded
better<00:02:11.819> than<00:02:12.360> Monday<00:02:12.780> Night<00:02:12.959> Raw

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
better than Monday Night Raw

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.190 
better than Monday Night Raw
and<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:15.030> only<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.540> talent<00:02:16.050> but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and because of not only the talent but

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.900 
and because of not only the talent but
because<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.860> storylines<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.550> who<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.790> on

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
because of the storylines and who was on

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
because of the storylines and who was on
the<00:02:17.940> creative<00:02:18.390> team<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.140> time<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.950> I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the creative team at that time so I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.900 
the creative team at that time so I
understand<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.550> been<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.700> lot<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
understand there's been a lot of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
understand there's been a lot of
adjustments<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.540> understand<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.020> there's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
adjustments I understand that there's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.960 
adjustments I understand that there's
been<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> lot<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> changes<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.100> these<00:02:23.520> creative

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
been a lot of changes but these creative

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.250 
been a lot of changes but these creative
changes<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.570> are<00:02:24.600> going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.870> taking

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
changes that are going to be taking

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.710 
changes that are going to be taking
place<00:02:25.410> i<00:02:25.710> think<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.430> only<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> huge

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
place i think is only going to be a huge

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.590 
place i think is only going to be a huge
momentum<00:02:28.260> booster<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:30.180> raw<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
momentum booster for for raw and

SmackDown is there a reason to watch

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.080 
SmackDown is there a reason to watch
smackdown<00:02:43.410> not<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.550> mean<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.940> want

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
smackdown not really I mean if you want

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
smackdown not really I mean if you want
to<00:02:45.150> watch<00:02:45.240> some<00:02:45.420> good<00:02:45.780> in-ring<00:02:45.960> talent<00:02:46.560> okay

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
to watch some good in-ring talent okay

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.090 
to watch some good in-ring talent okay
that's<00:02:47.520> good<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.050> WWE<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.170> World<00:02:49.530> Wrestling

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that's good but WWE is World Wrestling

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.400 
that's good but WWE is World Wrestling
Entertainment<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.420> need<00:02:51.600> wrestling<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.320> you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
Entertainment you need wrestling and you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.810 
Entertainment you need wrestling and you
need<00:02:52.560> entertainment<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.370> that's<00:02:53.520> where<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
need entertainment and that's where the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.390 
need entertainment and that's where the
WWE<00:02:54.420> has<00:02:54.570> kind<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.900> field<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> certain

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
WWE has kind of field to a certain

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.740 
WWE has kind of field to a certain
standard<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.930> think<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.560> huge<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.750> think

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
standard so I think this is huge I think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.620 
standard so I think this is huge I think
that<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.050> something<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> WWE

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
that this is something that the WWE

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.850 
that this is something that the WWE
should<00:03:03.630> like<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:03.990> said<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.350> they<00:03:04.620> should<00:03:04.650> have

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
should like I said it they should have

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040 
should like I said it they should have
never<00:03:05.130> changed<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:06.120> perception<00:03:06.330> they<00:03:06.900> should

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
never changed the perception they should

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.650 
never changed the perception they should
have<00:03:07.140> never<00:03:07.320> changed<00:03:08.060> how<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.270> did<00:03:09.480> things

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
have never changed how they did things

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.260 
have never changed how they did things
with<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.320> flow<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.710> storylines<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.910> seeing

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
with the flow of storylines and seeing

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.480 
with the flow of storylines and seeing
them<00:03:12.480> transform<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.350> seeing<00:03:13.590> them<00:03:13.830> progress

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
them transform and seeing them progress

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.550 
them transform and seeing them progress
throughout<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.660> week<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.200> could<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:16.410> a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
throughout the week so you could have a

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.680 
throughout the week so you could have a
you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.130> reason<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.670> watch<00:03:17.850> both<00:03:18.090> raw<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
you know reason to watch both raw and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.720 
you know reason to watch both raw and
