00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
actually drop weapon because when I've

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
actually drop weapon because when I've
been<00:00:46.289> playing<00:00:46.530> us<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> realize<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.520> they

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
been playing us I realize that they

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
been playing us I realize that they
don't<00:00:48.149> always<00:00:48.390> drop<00:00:48.870> their<00:00:49.020> weapons<00:00:49.050> down

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
don't always drop their weapons down

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.340 
don't always drop their weapons down
let's<00:00:50.539> take<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.719> example<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.170> they're

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
let's take for example if they're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
let's take for example if they're
throwing<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.219> stun<00:00:53.520> grenade<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.090> knife

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
throwing a stun grenade as you knife

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.910 
throwing a stun grenade as you knife
from<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.530> drop<00:00:55.770> their

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
from in the back they don't drop their

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.270 
from in the back they don't drop their
weapon<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.460> reason<00:00:57.170> but<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.829> rather

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
weapon for some reason but it's rather

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
weapon for some reason but it's rather
enjoyable<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> tricky

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
enjoyable and it is kind of tricky

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
enjoyable and it is kind of tricky
because<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.680> enemy<00:01:01.829> team<00:01:02.100> things<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> run<00:01:02.730> out

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
because the enemy team things to run out

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
because the enemy team things to run out
the<00:01:02.969> skull<00:01:03.300> crossbones<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.019> come<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.229> with

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the skull crossbones to come up with

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.560 
the skull crossbones to come up with
their<00:01:04.439> teammates<00:01:04.880> that<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> my

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
their teammates that right there is my

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
their teammates that right there is my
only<00:01:06.810> death<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> game<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.280> was

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
only death to the game when I was

that's my two cents on the thermal

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300 
that's my two cents on the thermal
scopes<00:03:14.670> they<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:15.810> tried<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> cram<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.040> game
