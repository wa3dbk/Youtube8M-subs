and really get a good grasp of that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.619 
and really get a good grasp of that
where<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.110> letters<00:00:52.789> abcdefg<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
where we go from the letters abcdefg for

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
where we go from the letters abcdefg for
the<00:00:54.719> names<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> keys<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.100> we

the names of all the keys and then we

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.410 
the names of all the keys and then we
count<00:00:56.930> 12<00:00:57.930> 6<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.620> extract<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.609> chords<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
count 12 6 and we extract the chords in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.950 
count 12 6 and we extract the chords in
positions<00:01:01.020> 1<00:01:01.410> 4<00:01:01.710> 5<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> 6<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.480> our<00:01:03.629> four

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
positions 1 4 5 and 6 to get our four

of a and if you go back to video three
and<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.590> how<00:02:15.709> that's<00:02:15.950> done<00:02:16.220> you'll<00:02:16.880> know<00:02:17.090> that

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and see how that's done you'll know that

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.900 
and see how that's done you'll know that
what<00:02:17.390> we're<00:02:17.599> really<00:02:17.870> playing<00:02:18.319> here<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:20.200> d<00:02:21.200> e

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
what we're really playing here is a d e

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.550 
what we're really playing here is a d e
and<00:02:23.440> f<00:02:24.440> sharp<00:02:24.709> minor<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> great<00:02:27.260> way

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and f sharp minor so this is a great way

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.490
