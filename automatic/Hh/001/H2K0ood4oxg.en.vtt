00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.460 
better than the original system if i go
into<00:01:49.550> let's<00:01:50.420> say<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.570> go<00:01:50.600> into<00:01:50.840> penn<00:01:51.080> door<00:01:51.260> right

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
into let's say I go into penn door right

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.510 
into let's say I go into penn door right
now<00:01:52.210> okay<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.690> i<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.320> be<00:01:54.440> in<00:01:54.620> pandora<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.430> i

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
the other but it's easier than you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.420

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
actually having to go from you know

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.430 
actually having to go from you know
normally<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.510> would<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.110> then<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.319> have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
normally you would be here then you have

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.650 
normally you would be here then you have
to<00:02:48.530> go<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.860> home<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.370> then<00:02:50.270> from<00:02:50.420> home

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
to go to the home and then from home

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.570 
to go to the home and then from home
you'd<00:02:50.870> have<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.170> go<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.530> find<00:02:51.770> what<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.370> want

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
to do next so it's it's I don't want to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.259 
to do next so it's it's I don't want to
say<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.250> multitasking<00:02:55.519> because<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.150> really

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
say it's multitasking because it really

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.509 
say it's multitasking because it really
isn't<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.260> allows<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> jump<00:02:58.280> from

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
isn't but it allows you to jump from

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.720 
isn't but it allows you to jump from
think<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> thing<00:02:59.830> without<00:03:00.830> having<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.550> keep

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
think the thing without having to keep

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.820 
think the thing without having to keep
you<00:03:02.269> know<00:03:02.390> I'm<00:03:02.630> here<00:03:02.930> let<00:03:03.110> me<00:03:03.230> close<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.680> let<00:03:03.800> me

cool and speaking of email that pretty
much<00:04:33.840> they've<00:04:34.020> updated<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.800> email<00:04:35.130> app<00:04:35.310> if

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
much they've updated the email app if

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.520 
much they've updated the email app if
you<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.790> apps<00:04:36.330> right<00:04:36.630> here<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.350> guess

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
you go to apps right here the I guess

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.660 
you go to apps right here the I guess
they<00:04:40.680> kind<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.920> figured<00:04:41.220> out<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.370> hey<00:04:41.640> you

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
they kind of figured out that hey you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.610 
they kind of figured out that hey you
know<00:04:41.850> we<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:42.390> need<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.690> have<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.140> email<00:04:43.440> app

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
know we just need to have the email app

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.650 
know we just need to have the email app
on<00:04:43.860> board<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.370> when<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.610> get<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.210> don't

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
on board so when you get it you don't

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.150 
on board so when you get it you don't
have<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> download<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.500> email<00:04:46.800> app<00:04:46.950> that's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
have to download the email app that's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.700 
have to download the email app that's
already<00:04:47.400> on<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.760> device<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:49.080> looks<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.560> lot

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
already on the device and it looks a lot

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.660 
already on the device and it looks a lot
nicer<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:51.030> they<00:04:51.180> really<00:04:51.450> updated<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:53.520> know

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
nicer so they really updated it you know

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.740 
nicer so they really updated it you know
it's<00:04:53.850> brighter<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.740> text<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.130> bigger<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:57.480> I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
it's brighter the text is bigger and I

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.720 
it's brighter the text is bigger and I
thought<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:57.990> thought<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.980> know<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.280> interface

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
thought I thought you know the interface

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.280 
thought I thought you know the interface
is<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.030> little<00:05:00.150> bit<00:05:00.420> better<00:05:00.600> than<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.960> older

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
is a little bit better than the older

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.060 
is a little bit better than the older
way<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.590> was<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:04.530> know<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.680> like<00:05:04.920> that

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
way it was so you know I like that

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.920 
way it was so you know I like that
thought<00:05:05.280> that<00:05:05.340> was<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.610> plus<00:05:05.850> it's<00:05:06.180> still<00:05:06.660> very

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
thought that was a plus it's still very

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.170 
thought that was a plus it's still very
basic<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:08.460> can<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:08.790> look<00:05:08.940> at<00:05:09.030> your

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
basic but you can do to look at your

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.820 
basic but you can do to look at your
folders<00:05:09.570> now<00:05:09.780> you<00:05:09.840> can<00:05:10.320> kind<00:05:10.530> of<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.770> little

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
folders now you can kind of get a little

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.260 
folders now you can kind of get a little
