Shane when I met him and I heard his

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.650 
Shane when I met him and I heard his
music<00:00:24.740> what<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> found<00:00:26.010> fascinating<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.580> he<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
music what I found fascinating was he is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.099 
music what I found fascinating was he is
this<00:00:27.869> jazz<00:00:28.349> repertoire<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:30.539> somehow<00:00:30.810> it's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this jazz repertoire but somehow it's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
this jazz repertoire but somehow it's
different<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> unique<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.399> him<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:33.059> he's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
different and unique to him because he's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.160 
different and unique to him because he's
he's<00:00:34.110> he's<00:00:34.649> kind<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.630> infected<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> jazz

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
he's he's kind of infected that jazz

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
he's he's kind of infected that jazz
repertoire<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.070> he<00:00:38.309> does<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.000> his<00:00:39.270> eyes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
repertoire that he does with his eyes

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
repertoire that he does with his eyes
are<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.079> John<00:00:40.290> traditional<00:00:40.860> roots<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.399> I've

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
are by John traditional roots and I've

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.819 
are by John traditional roots and I've
always<00:00:42.239> find<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:42.989> interesting<00:00:43.559> when

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
always find this very interesting when

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
always find this very interesting when
when<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.280> inject<00:00:44.879> other<00:00:45.210> forms<00:00:45.870> or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
when you inject other forms or

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
when you inject other forms or
traditions<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> classical<00:00:48.270> form

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
traditions into into a classical form

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.619 
traditions into into a classical form
and<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> called<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.059> pursuit<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> now

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and so I called the the pursuit of now

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.119 
and so I called the the pursuit of now
simply<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.140> well<00:00:52.770> how<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.100> how<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
simply because well how do i how do I

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.180 
simply because well how do i how do I
deal<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.520> complex<00:00:57.530> music<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
deal with this complex music and I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.010 
deal with this complex music and I
thought<00:00:59.340> well<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.750> back<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
thought well I would like to go back to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
thought well I would like to go back to
my<00:01:01.140> roots<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.770> sense<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> sense<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
my roots in a sense in the sense that I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
my roots in a sense in the sense that I
used<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> improvise<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> lot<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.580> first

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
used to improvise a lot when I was first

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
used to improvise a lot when I was first
starting<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:06.000> career<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.890> choreographer

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
starting my career as a choreographer

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.690 
starting my career as a choreographer
and<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> thought<00:01:09.229> why<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.260> try<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.430> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and I thought why not try this here so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
and I thought why not try this here so
I'm<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:11.850> jumping<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> deep<00:01:12.659> end<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I'm really jumping in the deep end but I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.179 
I'm really jumping in the deep end but I
think<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:16.170> important<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.650> me<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> try

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
think it's it's important for me to try

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.810 
think it's it's important for me to try
and<00:01:18.590> place<00:01:19.590> myself<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> situation<00:01:20.640> where<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and place myself in a situation where I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
and place myself in a situation where I
am<00:01:21.270> responding<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> music<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> don't

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
am responding to the music but I don't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.109 
am responding to the music but I don't
bring<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:24.630> ready<00:01:25.170> ready<00:01:25.979> made<00:01:26.280> piece<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
bring a ready ready made piece if you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.289 
bring a ready ready made piece if you
like<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.189> quite<00:01:29.340> unique<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> sense

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
like so it's quite unique in that sense

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
like so it's quite unique in that sense
because<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:33.020> won't<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> able<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> reproduce<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
because I won't be able to reproduce it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
because I won't be able to reproduce it
