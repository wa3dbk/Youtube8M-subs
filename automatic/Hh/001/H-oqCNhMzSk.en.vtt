00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and a little bit before and now we're in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.420 
and a little bit before and now we're in
this<00:00:15.750> deep<00:00:15.990> freeze<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.650> high<00:00:16.920> today<00:00:17.160> is

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this deep freeze and the high today is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
this deep freeze and the high today is
gonna<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> negative<00:00:18.779> maybe<00:00:19.560> negative

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
gonna be like a negative maybe negative

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.750 
gonna be like a negative maybe negative
12<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.580> far<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.029> only<00:00:21.210> hit<00:00:21.449> negative<00:00:21.869> 14<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
12 so far it's only hit negative 14 and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.890 
12 so far it's only hit negative 14 and
I'm<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.210> sure<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.539> gonna<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.779> any

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I'm not really sure it's gonna go any

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330 
I'm not really sure it's gonna go any
higher<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.830> thought<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> would

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
higher than that so I thought we would

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.620 
higher than that so I thought we would
do<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.699> experiment

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
do a little experiment

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.580 
do a little experiment
besides<00:00:28.050> experiment<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.349> can't

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
besides experiment and see if we can't

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
besides experiment and see if we can't
make<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:32.160> snow<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:32.969> ice<00:00:33.149> just

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
make a little snow or a little ice just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
make a little snow or a little ice just
to<00:00:33.660> show<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:34.079> cold<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.210> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
