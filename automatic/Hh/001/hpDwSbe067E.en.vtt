past a whole lot so I just want to touch

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.750 
past a whole lot so I just want to touch
on<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> for<00:04:57.230> just<00:04:57.380> a<00:04:57.470> second<00:04:57.860> but<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.160> know<00:04:58.430> it

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
on it for just a second but I know it

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.820 
on it for just a second but I know it
was<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.420> was<00:04:59.540> kind<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.380> was<00:05:00.500> Adam

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
was it was kind of you and it was Adam

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.650 
was it was kind of you and it was Adam
that<00:05:00.980> pretty<00:05:01.460> much<00:05:01.610> started<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.180> band<00:05:02.360> back

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
that pretty much started the band back

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.170 
that pretty much started the band back
in<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.900> day<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:04.010> I'm<00:05:04.280> assuming<00:05:04.670> that<00:05:04.850> at<00:05:05.060> one

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
in the day so I'm assuming that at one

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.520 
in the day so I'm assuming that at one
point<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.510> guys<00:05:05.600> were<00:05:05.660> probably<00:05:05.960> friends

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
point you guys were probably friends

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.260 
point you guys were probably friends
obviously<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:07.040> ended<00:05:07.190> on<00:05:07.400> horrible<00:05:07.880> terms<00:05:08.090> but

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
obviously it ended on horrible terms but

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.640 
obviously it ended on horrible terms but
do<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.450> ever<00:05:08.510> speak<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.900> Adam<00:05:09.230> anymore<00:05:09.500> do<00:05:09.590> you

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
do you ever speak to Adam anymore do you

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.870 
do you ever speak to Adam anymore do you
know<00:05:09.740> what<00:05:09.830> he's<00:05:09.920> up<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.130> these<00:05:10.430> days<00:05:10.670> huh

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
know what he's up to these days huh

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.820 
know what he's up to these days huh
how's<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.570> relationship<00:05:12.140> now<00:05:12.320> just<00:05:12.650> move

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
how's that relationship now just move

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.700 
how's that relationship now just move
forward<00:05:13.070> uh<00:05:13.990> yeah<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.020> think<00:05:15.080> we're<00:05:15.350> both<00:05:15.470> kind

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.750 
forward uh yeah I think we're both kind
of<00:05:15.740> just<00:05:15.890> moving<00:05:16.160> forward<00:05:16.310> you<00:05:16.490> know<00:05:16.580> he's
