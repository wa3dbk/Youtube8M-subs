as<00:01:43.229> well<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.470> all<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.700> had<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> good

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
as well so all of these have had a good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.469 
as well so all of these have had a good
thorough<00:01:45.899> clean<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.000> next

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
thorough clean now from there the next

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
thorough clean now from there the next
thing<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.229> determine<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.820> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thing is to determine how you want this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
thing is to determine how you want this
to<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.210> place<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
to be place so I'm going to use the and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
to be place so I'm going to use the and
you<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> order<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.810> anything<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you like the order of of anything the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.030 
you like the order of of anything the
the<00:01:56.340> heavier<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.630> whatever<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.829> going

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the heavier the what whatever is going

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580 
the heavier the what whatever is going
to<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.479> stacked<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:00.930> sure<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> your

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to be stacked up make sure that your

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
to be stacked up make sure that your
base<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.270> sturdy<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.990> start

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
base is really really sturdy to start

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
base is really really sturdy to start
with<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.729> into

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
with so that's just going to go into

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.260 
with so that's just going to go into
there<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.280> possibly<00:02:08.280> will<00:02:08.640> put<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
there and then I possibly will put that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.630 
there and then I possibly will put that
to<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:10.229> I'm<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.679> put<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.220> steam

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to there now I'm going to put the steam

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.000 
to there now I'm going to put the steam
down<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.690> once<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.770> low

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
down because once this is low

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.210 
down because once this is low
it<00:02:14.159> up<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.459> cakes<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.629> went<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.319> way<00:02:16.709> I'm

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it up with cakes if I went that way I'm

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.130 
it up with cakes if I went that way I'm
actually<00:02:17.489> losing<00:02:17.939> a<00:02:18.209> bit<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.450> room<00:02:18.659> so<00:02:18.930> make

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
actually losing a bit of room so make

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.199 
actually losing a bit of room so make
sure<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> keep<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
sure you use it keep it that way and

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.140 
sure you use it keep it that way and
then<00:02:21.720> from<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.560> will<00:02:22.680> possibly<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
then from there I will possibly put that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.509 
then from there I will possibly put that
onto<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.680> other<00:02:25.860> thing<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.310> when

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
onto there and the other thing is when

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.610 
onto there and the other thing is when
you're<00:02:26.640> doing<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.180> who<00:02:27.689> you<00:02:28.110> make<00:02:28.290> sure<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you're doing this who you make sure that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.979 
you're doing this who you make sure that
everything<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.510> perfectly<00:02:30.510> balanced

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
everything is all perfectly balanced

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.020 
everything is all perfectly balanced
before<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.470> go<00:02:31.650> because<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.220> could<00:02:32.670> all<00:02:32.879> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
before you go because it could all the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.630 
before you go because it could all the
engine<00:02:33.329> tears<00:02:33.599> my<00:02:33.959> love's<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.440> then<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.250> next

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
engine tears my love's and then the next

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.890 
engine tears my love's and then the next
thing<00:02:35.760> I'm<00:02:35.909> going<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.840> to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.339 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
put<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.379> onto<00:02:37.680> there<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.599> then<00:02:39.599> I'll<00:02:39.930> put

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
put that onto there and then I'll put

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.309 
put that onto there and then I'll put
that<00:02:41.129> onto<00:02:41.549> there<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.959> that

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
that onto there like that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.940 
that onto there like that
isn't<00:02:44.129> that<00:02:44.420> cool<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.689> groovy<00:02:45.959> into<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.500> best

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
isn't that cool and groovy into the best

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.640 
isn't that cool and groovy into the best
way<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.579> using<00:02:48.329> up<00:02:48.659> little<00:02:49.200> bits<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.590> pieces

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
way of using up little bits and pieces

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.949 
way of using up little bits and pieces
you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.099> also<00:02:50.310> do<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.760> same<00:02:50.970> thing<00:02:51.299> with

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
you can also do the same thing with

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.680 
you can also do the same thing with
crockery<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.159> just<00:02:53.340> load<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.700> up<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.480> from

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
crockery you just load it up so from

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.470 
crockery you just load it up so from
there<00:02:54.870> now<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.139> I've<00:02:55.379> got<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.799> all

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
there now that I've got that all

you can also just bring your glue out a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.280 
you can also just bring your glue out a
little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.180> goes<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.389> long<00:03:33.660> way<00:03:33.900> don't<00:03:34.169> forget

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
going to do is do the base first just

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.229 
going to do is do the base first just
you<00:03:46.260> don't<00:03:46.560> need<00:03:46.949> very<00:03:47.310> much<00:03:47.519> I'm<00:03:47.790> saying<00:03:48.090> it

again you do not need very much and the
great<00:03:50.519> stuff<00:03:50.910> with<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.629> that<00:03:52.260> once<00:03:52.650> it

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
great stuff with this is that once it

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.610 
great stuff with this is that once it
dries<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.900> can't<00:03:55.139> even<00:03:55.349> tell

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
dries it is just you can't even tell

that<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.859> there<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.669> other<00:03:56.819> thing<00:03:57.030> you've

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that it's there the other thing you've

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.360 
that it's there the other thing you've
got<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.389> careful<00:03:57.720> about<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.099> little

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
got to be careful about is it's a little

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.430 
got to be careful about is it's a little
bit<00:03:59.489> toxic<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.419> does<00:04:00.659> have<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> little<00:04:01.290> bit

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
bit toxic and it does have a little bit

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.080 
bit toxic and it does have a little bit
of<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.680> vapor<00:04:01.889> which<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.190> not<00:04:02.489> very<00:04:02.699> nice

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
of a vapor which is not very nice

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.119 
of a vapor which is not very nice
right<00:04:03.419> from<00:04:03.659> there<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.139> next<00:04:04.349> thing<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.919> to

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
right from there the next thing is to

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.970 
right from there the next thing is to
get<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.329> exact<00:04:06.930> middle<00:04:07.470> you'll<00:04:07.769> have

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
get that in the exact middle you'll have

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.960 
get that in the exact middle you'll have
a<00:04:08.010> few<00:04:08.489> seconds<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:10.079> move<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.889> around<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.699> make

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
a few seconds to move it around but make

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.300 
a few seconds to move it around but make
sure<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.720> flat<00:04:13.199> and<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.889> you're<00:04:14.099> in

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
sure that that is flat and if you're in

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.640 
sure that that is flat and if you're in
doubt<00:04:14.669> get<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.479> spirit<00:04:15.840> level<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.229> put<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.500> on

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
doubt get a spirit level and put that on

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.710 
doubt get a spirit level and put that on
there<00:04:16.919> right<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.669> next<00:04:17.909> thing<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.299> put<00:04:18.539> down

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
there right the next thing I put down

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.170 
there right the next thing I put down
there<00:04:18.900> was<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.280> we'll<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.729> run<00:04:21.000> that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
there was this so we'll just run that

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.399 
there was this so we'll just run that
around<00:04:21.479> there<00:04:21.570> don't<00:04:21.810> forget<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.200> that's

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
around there don't forget that that's

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.890 
around there don't forget that that's
not<00:04:22.710> flush<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.219> flat<00:04:23.280> either<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.360> make<00:04:24.630> sure

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
not flush and flat either so make sure

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.830 
not flush and flat either so make sure
that<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.260> get<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.620> all<00:04:25.830> around<00:04:26.219> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
that you get that all around the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.980 
that you get that all around the
just<00:04:27.169> like<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:29.030> will<00:04:29.240> go<00:04:29.419> onto<00:04:29.630> there

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
just like so that will go onto there

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.920 
just like so that will go onto there
like<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:31.250> make<00:04:31.760> sure<00:04:32.030> also<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.540> that

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
like that and make sure also that that

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.780 
like that and make sure also that that
is<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.380> middle<00:04:33.710> in<00:04:33.860> its<00:04:34.040> not<00:04:34.250> soul<00:04:34.520> just

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
is in the middle in its not soul just

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.300 
is in the middle in its not soul just
move<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.240> around<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:36.139> next<00:04:36.680> thing<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.100> do<00:04:37.280> is

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
move that around the next thing to do is

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.969 
move that around the next thing to do is
to<00:04:37.729> go<00:04:37.910> around<00:04:38.300> here<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.020> hope<00:04:39.410> I've<00:04:39.620> done<00:04:39.800> this

other<00:04:44.840> thing<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.350> could<00:04:45.530> do<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:45.860> you

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
other thing that you could do is you

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.050 
other thing that you could do is you
could<00:04:46.130> put<00:04:46.280> oh<00:04:46.430> look<00:04:46.699> there's<00:04:46.910> another

incoming who wants me somebody wants me

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.590 
incoming who wants me somebody wants me
and<00:04:50.180> then<00:04:50.960> put<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:52.280> onto<00:04:52.580> there<00:04:52.940> like<00:04:53.120> there

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and then put that onto there like there

and then put that onto there like there
and<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.470> other<00:04:54.650> thing<00:04:54.949> is<00:04:55.070> once<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:55.669> is<00:04:55.850> all

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
and the other thing is once this is all

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.770 
and the other thing is once this is all
fused<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.900> together<00:04:57.139> it<00:04:57.740> will<00:04:58.490> not<00:04:59.090> come<00:04:59.540> off

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
fused and together it will not come off

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.850 
fused and together it will not come off
and<00:05:00.970> but<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.150> can<00:05:02.419> use<00:05:02.690> things<00:05:03.020> like<00:05:03.200> acetone

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
and but you can use things like acetone

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.490 
and but you can use things like acetone
or<00:05:04.160> acetone<00:05:04.880> or<00:05:04.910> acetate<00:05:05.540> or<00:05:05.600> any<00:05:06.139> of<00:05:06.350> those

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
or acetone or acetate or any of those

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.930 
or acetone or acetate or any of those
sorts<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:06.979> things<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.400> could<00:05:07.700> use<00:05:07.910> to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
sorts of things that you could use to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.480 
sorts of things that you could use to
take<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.479> off<00:05:08.600> but<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.870> does<00:05:09.200> take<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:10.100> little

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
take it off but it does take a little

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.550 
take it off but it does take a little
bit<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.760> work<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.419> that<00:05:11.630> goes<00:05:11.810> on<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.290> light

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
bit of work so that goes on to the light

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.040 
bit of work so that goes on to the light
there<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.280> then<00:05:13.820> once<00:05:14.090> you've<00:05:14.360> done<00:05:14.389> this<00:05:14.840> you

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
there and then once you've done this you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.940 
there and then once you've done this you
