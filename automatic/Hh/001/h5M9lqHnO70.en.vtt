Jets<00:01:54.800> all<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.070> through<00:01:58.120> that<00:01:59.120> will<00:01:59.240> drain<00:01:59.390> so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
Jets all that through that will drain so

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:50.960 
Jets all that through that will drain so
much<00:01:59.690> quicker

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.560 

it<00:02:51.970> doesn't<00:02:52.300> need<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> come<00:02:52.630> his<00:02:52.840> chug<00:02:54.840> buses

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
it doesn't need to come his chug buses

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.040 
it doesn't need to come his chug buses
the<00:02:58.570> nearest<00:02:58.930> AC<00:02:59.260> comes<00:02:59.770> Chuck<00:03:03.840> pump<00:03:04.840> it's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
