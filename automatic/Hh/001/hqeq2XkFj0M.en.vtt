you hey it's use the device now once you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.670 
you hey it's use the device now once you
do<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.580> all<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.120> need<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:13.190> start<00:03:15.680> so

do that all you need to do is start so
you'll<00:03:16.860> see<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.160> gonna<00:03:17.310> flash<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.459> this<00:03:23.459> is

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
you'll see it's gonna flash and this is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.039 
you'll see it's gonna flash and this is
foolproof<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.209> will<00:03:24.390> work<00:03:24.540> for<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
foolproof this will work for all the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.560 
foolproof this will work for all the
variants<00:03:25.530> it'll<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:26.190> should<00:03:26.670> never<00:03:26.790> fail<00:03:27.209> it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
variants it'll it should never fail it

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.479 
variants it'll it should never fail it
has<00:03:28.170> never<00:03:28.320> failed<00:03:28.560> me<00:03:28.680> once<00:03:28.950> yet<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.430> I'm

have to backtrack to 4.1.1 at least for
the<00:04:17.329> Canadian<00:04:17.750> variants<00:04:18.880> I'm<00:04:19.880> not<00:04:20.479> too<00:04:20.630> sure

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the Canadian variants I'm not too sure

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.420
