00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:07.190
 From among the popular fx model trek's cross bikes 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.240
 What 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:17.380
 Introducing the 2013 model 7.4 fx 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.920
 The 2013 model 7.4 fx is in four colors 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 One of the colors is this orange 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 This color is that Japan limited color According to the announcement from the manufacturer 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.430
 There is a very big thing about the frame about the specification change from 2012 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430
 not 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.720
 The aluminum frame in the base we use the front fork of carbon 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.790
 Because it is a carbon front fork, not only weight reduction 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:00.810
 Very good because there is shock absorption from the road surface 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:03.410
 How the handle of the vibration to the handle is transmitted is very soft and it is very good when riding on a long distance 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.410
 I think 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.820
 It is a driving system 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:23.189
 A three-speed shift back is a grenade 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.310
 Basically all Shimano parts are used, but only chains use third-party products 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310
 Ne 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.960
 I will also shift 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.330
 So is the brake too 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 Re direction of the brake body is E' 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 I use another company's brake 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:50.220
 If this can also be done more by replacing with Shimano products etc. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.790
 Do not think you do good to do so, please follow the instructions below when, for example, the number of customized many times because I think 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.940
 Just this brake 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.220
 Frame orange and a 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 I think that it is very good because it uses fashionable white according to the castle of One Point 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.550
 I will 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.550
 The picture is also summarized in rare white 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:28.090
 It's a tire but it's 700 times 32 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.440
 It is 3 mm cans like that because normal mama chari is 30c 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.440
 It will come out quite speed 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:50.960
 So the 2013 model 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.960
 7.4 fx This size is 20 inches and the weight was actually measured 10.9 k 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 that's all
