00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.240
 seliverstov gagadget.com divisions themselves 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.200
 henceforth today we will talk about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.209
 choosing a mobile operating system 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.999
 the fact is that at the gate now 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.359
 there is such a situation that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.079
 frost pentathlon can be 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.589
 the appearance of phones and smartphones 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.669
 built on different operating 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.169
 systems and often users 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.719
 cannot make a choice consciously and 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.829
 just because I do not know what she korsuna 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.690
 the system is different from the other 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.960
 today we have a pop 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.220
 to sell 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.220
 paint and the simple answer to this question 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.450
 the essence 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.390
 either the swampman just calls for advice 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.860
 eu can this is one of the oldest mobile 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 platforms with all the consequences 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.699
 benefits 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.889
 in the form of a huge amount of available 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.750
 applications for every taste 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.030
 the rest up to warehouse accounting systems 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.430
 most minutes a device 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.730
 comes preloaded 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.250
 a set of programs for working with documents 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 microsoft office 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.369
 the consequence of this method failed even 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.980
 presentations 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.250
 on the other hand 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 delivery for such a national 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.610
 wealth is obsolete and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 interface which in many cases is not 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.640
 allows you to do without the stylus 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.380
 not the highest stability 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.660
 besides the standard browser 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.410
 weak internet explorer 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.020
 does not hold water 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 true many manufacturers 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.610
 set rather 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 decent caravans 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.870
 Russia he is another operating system 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.620
 the cost of the story that has acquired 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.280
 touch interface 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.900
 relatively recently 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.390
 which is why the user 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.640
 regularly have to face a day 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450
 ribbons low price on light 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 yourself much sharpened by multimedia 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.900
 in particular, they placed quite 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.540
 successfully implemented work becomes 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.810
 easy 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.790
 the main flaw of yourself is superfluous 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.890
 operating system gullibility 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.470
 which when working with the Internet 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.610
 applications all the time after after 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.529
 confirm your actions 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:12.989
 it would seem a trifle 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.919
 but with constant use 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.899
 the phone is very annoying 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.669
 essentially 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.039
 control 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.059
 brand new but quickly gaining 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.139
 popularity of mobile platform 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.279
 its main advantage is 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.789
 tight integration with google web services 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.159
 the moment is not ready calendar contacts 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.299
 goes tight 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.409
 or automatic synchronization with them 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.659
 by air 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.980
 another plus is well thought out 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.909
 interface with such convenient elements 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.510
 as top spare areas 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.299
 introduced mandatory for all applications 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.959
 context menu 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.599
 we have control here are only two drawbacks 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.319
 early days usability 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.659
 proper telephone functions 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.249
 supporters active fires internet 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.259
 traffic 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.269
 Of course, if you want to spend money on 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.949
 mobile internet is this book possible 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:03.999
 will treat 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.809
 but then in our opinion 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.539
 the meaning of choosing the android is lost they 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.819
 another platform 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.419
 there is 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.239
 the church of that is excluded that 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.999
 so that the laws that first of all them 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.609
 that the user cannot own 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.079
 solve and functionality 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.569
 on the other hand 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.789
 functionality of our ability 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.229
 just a low level so 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:28.109
 is high 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.579
 that many users just 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.919
 need more 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.049
 but the phone closed troops 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.999
 generally different 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.400
 subjectively higher speed 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.989
 work great stability today 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.229
 longer battery life 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.369
 works in particular remembers 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:44.189
 n 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.369
 there is 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.319
 so 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.039
 what to choose 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.969
 the more so for which the phone is 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.629
 first and foremost on the phone 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.369
 we would recommend 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.319
 device 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.729
 closing of the plant 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.729
 to those users who love 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.549
 entertainment on the road we would advise 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.069
 buy a smartphone based 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.069
 semen 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.669
 who can't imagine his life without 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.779
 from mobile work with documents 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.779
 best suited to his words 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.600
 there is finally for the game the poles who often 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600
 spends free time on the Internet 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.040
 best suited 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.040
 devices based on android platform 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.389
 so everyone 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.110
 Thank you for your attention group
