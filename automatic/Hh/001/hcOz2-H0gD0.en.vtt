first those guys turn on you can hear my

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.630 
first those guys turn on you can hear my
relay<00:00:48.320> click<00:00:48.620> then<00:00:49.100> i'm<00:00:49.190> going<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.339> give<00:00:49.460> power

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
relay click then i'm going to give power

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.719 
relay click then i'm going to give power
to<00:00:51.040> all<00:00:52.040> through<00:00:52.369> my<00:00:52.489> Vipers<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:55.519> red

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.520 
indicating that there's 12 volt power to
them<00:01:01.430> right<00:01:01.580> now<00:01:03.159> but<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:05.229> currently<00:01:06.229> don't

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
them right now but I currently don't

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.850 
them right now but I currently don't
have<00:01:06.760> 120<00:01:07.760> volts<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.540> them<00:01:08.750> which<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.380> how<00:01:09.680> it's

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
have 120 volts to them which is how it's

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.530 
have 120 volts to them which is how it's
supposed<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.130> be<00:01:10.190> my<00:01:10.460> relay<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.120> enabling

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
supposed to be my relay is and enabling

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.610 
supposed to be my relay is and enabling
them<00:01:12.010> because<00:01:13.010> mach3<00:01:13.340> isn't<00:01:13.910> open<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.620> mach

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
them because mach3 isn't open and mach

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.360 
them because mach3 isn't open and mach
three<00:01:15.890> controls<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.550> relay<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.410> right<00:01:19.340> now

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
three controls the relay so right now

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.620 
three controls the relay so right now
this<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:20.000> how<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.180> system<00:01:20.630> sitting<00:01:20.840> and

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
this is how the system sitting and

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.960 
this is how the system sitting and
technically<00:01:23.630> I<00:01:24.040> don't<00:01:25.040> have<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.580> sea<00:01:26.030> bear<00:01:26.180> the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
technically I don't have a sea bear the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.780 
technically I don't have a sea bear the
driver<00:01:28.970> light<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.510> on<00:01:30.040> on<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.220> let's<00:01:31.430> see<00:01:31.580> all

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
driver light is on on it let's see all

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.140 
driver light is on on it let's see all
the<00:01:32.000> other<00:01:32.030> ones<00:01:32.390> gone<00:01:32.600> as<00:01:32.870> well<00:01:33.790> an<00:01:34.790> able

the other ones gone as well an able
isn't<00:01:35.450> on<00:01:35.540> though<00:01:35.750> my<00:01:35.930> power<00:01:37.000> power<00:01:38.000> LEDs

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
isn't on though my power power LEDs

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.740 
isn't on though my power power LEDs
wrong<00:01:38.720> as<00:01:38.840> well<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.290> everything<00:01:40.070> looks<00:01:40.100> a-okay

come on I go to configuration toward

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.200 
come on I go to configuration toward
some<00:02:01.130> pins<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:03.890> into<00:02:04.040> outputs<00:02:04.370> go<00:02:04.700> down<00:02:04.880> make

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
some pins go into outputs go down make

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.090 
some pins go into outputs go down make
sure<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.660> charge<00:02:05.930> pump<00:02:06.230> under<00:02:06.560> report<00:02:06.920> to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
sure that charge pump under report to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.330 
sure that charge pump under report to
pin<00:02:07.550> 17<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.210> okay<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.500> make<00:02:09.830> sure<00:02:10.010> I

before I had to ground those before I
grounded<00:04:10.639> the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
grounded the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.150 
grounded the
I<00:04:11.030> volt-<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.810> 12<00:04:12.020> volt<00:04:12.050> negative<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:13.010> would

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
I volt- in the 12 volt negative it would

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.760 
I volt- in the 12 volt negative it would
turn<00:04:13.310> right<00:04:13.550> on<00:04:13.730> run<00:04:14.090> perfectly<00:04:14.480> fine<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.590> just

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
turn right on run perfectly fine it just

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.500 
turn right on run perfectly fine it just
wouldn't<00:04:15.920> monitor<00:04:16.250> itself<00:04:16.579> well<00:04:16.910> now<00:04:17.060> I'm

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
wouldn't monitor itself well now I'm

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.229 
wouldn't monitor itself well now I'm
having<00:04:18.079> if<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> remember<00:04:18.739> those<00:04:18.890> uh<00:04:18.950> on<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
having if you remember those uh on the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.270 
having if you remember those uh on the
drivers<00:04:20.630> over<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:21.049> those<00:04:21.920> little<00:04:22.070> red

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
drivers over there those little red

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.130 
drivers over there those little red
lights<00:04:22.550> are<00:04:22.850> flashing<00:04:23.090> very<00:04:23.720> very<00:04:23.930> fast

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
lights are flashing very very fast

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.170 
lights are flashing very very fast
that's<00:04:24.470> because<00:04:24.650> i<00:04:24.710> do<00:04:24.770> not<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.220> 120<00:04:25.880> volts

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
that's because i do not have 120 volts

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.200 
that's because i do not have 120 volts
to<00:04:26.360> them<00:04:26.740> without<00:04:27.740> being<00:04:27.920> said<00:04:28.370> it's<00:04:28.910> sending

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
to them without being said it's sending

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.270 
to them without being said it's sending
I'm<00:04:29.360> sure<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.660> signal<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.560> breakout<00:04:30.890> border

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
I'm sure a signal to the breakout border

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.860 
I'm sure a signal to the breakout border
to<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:33.280> safety<00:04:34.280> charge<00:04:34.610> pump<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.120> saying<00:04:35.570> you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
to the safety charge pump and saying you

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.630 
to the safety charge pump and saying you
know<00:04:35.900> hey<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.920> do<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.310> an<00:04:37.460> error

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
know hey we have we do have an error

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.790 
know hey we have we do have an error
well<00:04:38.030> watch<00:04:38.390> I'm<00:04:38.750> going<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> click<00:04:39.110> go<00:04:39.530> and

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
well watch I'm going to click go and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.680 
well watch I'm going to click go and
you'll<00:04:40.100> hear<00:04:40.250> two<00:04:40.520> clicks<00:04:40.850> ones<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.330> turn<00:04:41.510> the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
you'll hear two clicks ones to turn the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.050 
you'll hear two clicks ones to turn the
power<00:04:41.810> on<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.500> then<00:04:43.010> another<00:04:43.220> one<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.880> turn

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
power on and then another one is to turn

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.570 
power on and then another one is to turn
the<00:04:44.210> relay<00:04:44.540> off<00:04:44.810> because<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.530> believe<00:04:46.130> it

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
the relay off because I believe it

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.870 
the relay off because I believe it
senses<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.750> doesn't<00:04:48.080> have<00:04:48.200> power<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:48.890> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
senses that it doesn't have power so the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.980 
senses that it doesn't have power so the
question<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.630> how<00:04:51.530> do<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:52.480> get<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.660> turn<00:04:53.930> on

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
question is how do we get it to turn on

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.100 
question is how do we get it to turn on
and<00:04:54.650> stay<00:04:55.010> on<00:04:55.090> you<00:04:56.090> know<00:04:56.210> there<00:04:56.570> needs<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.930> be<00:04:56.960> a

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and stay on you know there needs to be a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.090 
and stay on you know there needs to be a
delay<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.530> this<00:04:57.860> thing<00:04:59.230> because<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.890> lights

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
delay in this thing because the lights

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.180 
delay in this thing because the lights
are<00:05:01.250> flashing<00:05:01.400> right<00:05:01.790> now<00:05:02.440> which<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.470> good<00:05:03.770> and

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
are flashing right now which is good and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.430 
are flashing right now which is good and
it<00:05:04.490> knows<00:05:04.700> hey<00:05:05.090> we<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.450> an<00:05:05.570> issue<00:05:05.690> before<00:05:06.080> we

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
it knows hey we have an issue before we

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.380 
it knows hey we have an issue before we
turn<00:05:06.620> power<00:05:06.860> on<00:05:07.040> which<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.640> how<00:05:08.030> it's<00:05:08.240> supposed

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
turn power on which is how it's supposed

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.080 
turn power on which is how it's supposed
to<00:05:08.720> work<00:05:08.780> but<00:05:08.960> initially<00:05:09.530> powering<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.400> on<00:05:10.550> how

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
to work but initially powering it on how

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.090 
to work but initially powering it on how
do<00:05:11.150> we<00:05:11.270> go<00:05:11.450> from<00:05:11.570> no<00:05:11.780> power<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.230> power<00:05:12.440> its

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
do we go from no power to power its

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.400 
do we go from no power to power its
seeing<00:05:13.430> itself<00:05:13.820> its<00:05:14.060> own<00:05:14.180> air<00:05:14.390> I<00:05:14.540> hope<00:05:15.080> someone

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
seeing itself its own air I hope someone

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.469 
seeing itself its own air I hope someone
follows<00:05:15.770> me<00:05:15.800> on<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:16.160> but<00:05:16.430> here<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.180> go<00:05:17.860> on<00:05:19.479> off

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
follows me on that but here we go on off

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.080 
follows me on that but here we go on off
so<00:05:21.050> turns<00:05:21.530> on<00:05:21.770> exactly<00:05:22.460> how<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.729> supposed<00:05:22.970> to

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
so turns on exactly how it's supposed to

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.530 
so turns on exactly how it's supposed to
and<00:05:24.040> basically<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.550> little<00:05:25.820> LEDs<00:05:26.240> on<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
and basically the little LEDs on the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.390 
and basically the little LEDs on the
Viper<00:05:26.750> drivers<00:05:27.229> don't<00:05:27.680> turn<00:05:27.950> off<00:05:27.979> quick

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
Viper drivers don't turn off quick

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.610 
Viper drivers don't turn off quick
enough<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.240> sends<00:05:29.540> its<00:05:29.720> own<00:05:29.870> fault<00:05:30.169> signal

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
enough so it sends its own fault signal

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.130 
enough so it sends its own fault signal
right<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.979> back<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.850> I'm<00:05:32.030> getting<00:05:32.240> this<00:05:32.540> kind

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
right on back so I'm getting this kind

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.170 
right on back so I'm getting this kind
of<00:05:33.290> loop<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:34.370> need<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.970> get<00:05:35.090> out<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.540> loop

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
of loop I need to get out of the loop

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.580 
of loop I need to get out of the loop
the<00:05:38.180> only<00:05:38.419> way<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.630> get<00:05:38.990> out<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.320> loop<00:05:39.440> i

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
the only way to get out of the loop i

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.380 
the only way to get out of the loop i
guess<00:05:39.800> would<00:05:39.979> be<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.190> supply<00:05:40.550> power<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:41.150> the

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
guess would be to supply power to the

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.560 
guess would be to supply power to the
drivers<00:05:41.960> but<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.680> would<00:05:42.800> completely

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
drivers but that would completely

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.390 
drivers but that would completely
eliminate<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.930> safety<00:05:45.500> precaution<00:05:46.070> of<00:05:46.160> not

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
eliminate the safety precaution of not

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.100 
eliminate the safety precaution of not
having<00:05:46.790> power<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.180> drivers<00:05:47.540> before<00:05:47.930> we're

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
having power to the drivers before we're

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.570 
having power to the drivers before we're
in<00:05:48.320> walk<00:05:49.990> so<00:05:50.990> maybe<00:05:51.290> it's<00:05:51.500> just<00:05:51.560> a<00:05:51.740> quick<00:05:51.919> fix<00:05:52.220> i

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
in walk so maybe it's just a quick fix i

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.400 
in walk so maybe it's just a quick fix i
don't<00:05:53.150> know<00:05:53.240> i<00:05:53.270> think<00:05:53.390> i'm<00:05:53.720> at<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:53.930> very<00:05:54.140> last

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
don't know i think i'm at the very last

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.400 
don't know i think i'm at the very last
end<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.979> this<00:05:55.100> thing<00:05:55.810> pretty<00:05:56.810> sure<00:05:57.080> this<00:05:57.290> is

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
end of this thing pretty sure this is

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.500 
end of this thing pretty sure this is
the<00:05:57.440> last<00:05:57.680> step<00:05:58.220> if<00:05:58.460> i<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.700> get<00:05:58.820> this<00:05:58.880> going<00:05:59.330> it

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
the last step if i can get this going it

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.620 
the last step if i can get this going it
should<00:05:59.690> be<00:05:59.780> able<00:05:59.870> to<00:06:00.020> monitor<00:06:00.410> itself<00:06:01.630> before

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
should be able to monitor itself before

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.810 
should be able to monitor itself before
i<00:06:02.870> could<00:06:02.990> click<00:06:03.260> go<00:06:03.530> and<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:03.860> was<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.190> okay<00:06:04.520> and

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
i could click go and it was a okay and

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.219 
i could click go and it was a okay and
it<00:06:04.910> didn't<00:06:05.180> even<00:06:05.210> know<00:06:05.450> if<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:05.690> was<00:06:05.810> monitoring

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
it didn't even know if it was monitoring

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.960 
it didn't even know if it was monitoring
or<00:06:06.380> not<00:06:06.530> but<00:06:06.800> i<00:06:06.830> figured<00:06:07.340> now<00:06:07.520> it's<00:06:07.700> a<00:06:07.790> good

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
or not but i figured now it's a good

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.550 
or not but i figured now it's a good
sign<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.210> it's<00:06:08.479> clicking<00:06:08.900> twice<00:06:09.169> because

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
sign that it's clicking twice because

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.830 
sign that it's clicking twice because
it's<00:06:09.800> saying<00:06:09.979> hey<00:06:10.160> we<00:06:10.370> have<00:06:10.490> an<00:06:10.580> error<00:06:10.840> let's

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
it's saying hey we have an error let's

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.409 
it's saying hey we have an error let's
cut<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.110> power<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:13.160> know<00:06:13.280> but<00:06:13.520> really<00:06:14.180> it's

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
cut the power you know but really it's

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.390 
cut the power you know but really it's
not<00:06:14.570> an<00:06:14.780> error<00:06:15.110> yet<00:06:15.440> we're<00:06:15.680> just<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.100> just<00:06:16.160> a

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
not an error yet we're just it's just a

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.580 
not an error yet we're just it's just a
just<00:06:17.180> a<00:06:17.300> little<00:06:17.630> too<00:06:17.810> three<00:06:18.080> second<00:06:18.470> error

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
just a little too three second error

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.409 
just a little too three second error
while<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:19.010> drivers<00:06:19.370> need<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.669> little<00:06:20.000> bit<00:06:20.120> time

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
while the drivers need a little bit time

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.930 
while the drivers need a little bit time
to<00:06:20.570> take<00:06:20.840> you<00:06:21.680> know<00:06:21.710> that<00:06:22.039> power<00:06:22.250> in<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:22.760> turn

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
to take you know that power in and turn

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.439 
to take you know that power in and turn
that<00:06:23.150> fault<00:06:23.390> signal<00:06:23.810> off

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
that fault signal off

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.809 
that fault signal off
then<00:06:24.599> we<00:06:24.719> can<00:06:24.930> go<00:06:25.050> forth<00:06:25.379> so<00:06:25.819> hopefully

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
then we can go forth so hopefully

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.390 
then we can go forth so hopefully
someone<00:06:26.879> can<00:06:27.300> answer<00:06:27.509> that<00:06:27.659> and<00:06:28.099> yeah<00:06:29.099> from

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
someone can answer that and yeah from

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.629 
someone can answer that and yeah from
there<00:06:29.580> we'll<00:06:29.759> be<00:06:29.909> on<00:06:30.059> our<00:06:30.090> way<00:06:30.559> and<00:06:31.559> I<00:06:32.309> will

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
there we'll be on our way and I will

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:40.969 
there we'll be on our way and I will
climb<00:06:33.569> down<00:06:33.809> here<00:06:34.229> and<00:06:34.349> show<00:06:34.559> you<00:06:39.979> physically

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
climb down here and show you physically

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.799 
climb down here and show you physically
those<00:06:41.159> aerolites<00:06:41.759> right<00:06:41.939> there<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.330> flickering

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:42.809 
those aerolites right there a flickering

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.179 
those aerolites right there a flickering
super<00:06:43.139> fast<00:06:43.379> and<00:06:43.529> when<00:06:43.680> you<00:06:43.770> turn<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:43.949> power

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:44.189 
super fast and when you turn the power

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.070 
super fast and when you turn the power
on<00:06:44.339> those<00:06:44.729> air<00:06:44.879> lights<00:06:45.089> turn<00:06:45.330> off<00:06:45.479> but<00:06:45.839> it<00:06:45.930> just

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
on those air lights turn off but it just

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.890 
on those air lights turn off but it just
goes<00:06:46.229> so<00:06:46.529> fast<00:06:47.089> it<00:06:48.089> pretty<00:06:48.779> much

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
goes so fast it pretty much

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.779 
goes so fast it pretty much
instantaneously<00:06:49.830> is<00:06:49.979> it<00:06:50.099> checks<00:06:50.339> if<00:06:50.520> it<00:06:50.669> has<00:06:50.759> a

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
instantaneously is it checks if it has a

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.420 
instantaneously is it checks if it has a
fault<00:06:51.150> first<00:06:51.449> then<00:06:52.169> cuts<00:06:52.409> the<00:06:52.589> power<00:06:52.770> so<00:06:53.189> I

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
fault first then cuts the power so I

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.760 
fault first then cuts the power so I
mean<00:06:53.999> literally<00:06:54.599> to<00:06:54.719> it<00:06:54.930> if<00:06:55.110> it<00:06:55.259> had<00:06:55.409> a<00:06:55.439> two<00:06:55.740> or

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
mean literally to it if it had a two or

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.489 
mean literally to it if it had a two or
three<00:06:56.069> second<00:06:56.460> delay<00:06:56.839> just<00:06:57.839> for<00:06:58.080> the<00:06:58.199> initial

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:58.499 
three second delay just for the initial

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.499 
three second delay just for the initial
startup<00:06:59.039> or<00:06:59.249> maybe<00:06:59.669> I<00:06:59.759> can<00:06:59.939> do<00:07:00.060> something<00:07:00.270> to

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
startup or maybe I can do something to

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.659 
startup or maybe I can do something to
get<00:07:00.599> around<00:07:00.900> that<00:07:01.080> initially<00:07:01.620> and<00:07:01.919> then<00:07:01.949> have

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
get around that initially and then have

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.640 
get around that initially and then have
it<00:07:02.699> instantaneously<00:07:03.629> check<00:07:03.990> how<00:07:04.439> it's

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
it instantaneously check how it's

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.670 
it instantaneously check how it's
supposed<00:07:04.919> to<00:07:05.210> so<00:07:06.210> I<00:07:06.240> think<00:07:06.330> I'm<00:07:07.319> just<00:07:07.379> in<00:07:07.620> a

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
supposed to so I think I'm just in a

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.950 
supposed to so I think I'm just in a
loop<00:07:07.889> and<00:07:08.270> maybe<00:07:09.270> someone<00:07:09.479> point<00:07:09.779> me<00:07:09.810> in<00:07:09.930> the

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
loop and maybe someone point me in the

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.390 
loop and maybe someone point me in the
right<00:07:10.020> direction<00:07:10.169> other<00:07:11.039> than<00:07:11.069> that<00:07:11.249> I<00:07:11.279> think

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
right direction other than that I think

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.230 
right direction other than that I think
I'm<00:07:11.789> think<00:07:12.779> I'm<00:07:12.870> almost<00:07:13.080> done<00:07:13.259> with<00:07:13.439> this<00:07:13.589> I

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
I'm think I'm almost done with this I

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.239 
I'm think I'm almost done with this I
just<00:07:15.240> have<00:07:15.389> to<00:07:15.479> finish<00:07:15.629> up<00:07:15.930> this<00:07:16.139> kind<00:07:17.069> of<00:07:17.129> put

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249 
just have to finish up this kind of put

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.499 
just have to finish up this kind of put
it<00:07:17.310> back<00:07:17.430> together<00:07:17.580> do<00:07:17.909> some<00:07:18.089> wire<00:07:18.240> management

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
it back together do some wire management

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:21.769 
it back together do some wire management
and<00:07:19.039> I'll<00:07:20.039> be<00:07:20.219> good<00:07:20.339> to<00:07:20.399> go<00:07:20.520> on<00:07:20.879> the<00:07:21.419> electronic

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:21.779 
and I'll be good to go on the electronic

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.260 
and I'll be good to go on the electronic
side<00:07:22.080> hopefully<00:07:22.259> for<00:07:22.680> for<00:07:23.039> a<00:07:23.069> while<00:07:23.249> and<00:07:23.520> I<00:07:24.120> can

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
side hopefully for for a while and I can

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.670 
side hopefully for for a while and I can
focus<00:07:24.419> on<00:07:24.629> a<00:07:24.689> few<00:07:24.749> more<00:07:25.050> other<00:07:25.080> things<00:07:25.559> like

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
focus on a few more other things like

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.019 
focus on a few more other things like
the<00:07:25.800> vacuum<00:07:26.129> table<00:07:27.050> and<00:07:28.189> a<00:07:29.189> couple<00:07:29.699> of<00:07:29.909> the

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:30.029 
the vacuum table and a couple of the

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:31.579 
the vacuum table and a couple of the
little<00:07:30.210> projects<00:07:30.599> I<00:07:30.689> had<00:07:30.870> for<00:07:31.139> this<00:07:31.259> thing<00:07:31.469> I

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:31.589 
little projects I had for this thing I

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.619 
little projects I had for this thing I
need<00:07:31.770> I<00:07:31.889> would<00:07:32.039> like<00:07:32.189> to<00:07:32.310> finish<00:07:32.460> up<00:07:32.759> the

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:33.629 
need I would like to finish up the

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:36.320 
need I would like to finish up the
cooling<00:07:34.080> I'm<00:07:34.259> not<00:07:34.409> going<00:07:34.589> to<00:07:34.680> do<00:07:34.770> a<00:07:34.800> vacuum<00:07:35.330> I'm

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.330 
cooling I'm not going to do a vacuum I'm

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.209 
cooling I'm not going to do a vacuum I'm
only<00:07:36.509> basically<00:07:37.409> going<00:07:37.529> to<00:07:37.620> do<00:07:37.710> aluminum<00:07:38.129> on

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219 
only basically going to do aluminum on

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.699 
only basically going to do aluminum on
this<00:07:38.430> if<00:07:38.699> I<00:07:38.849> do<00:07:38.909> Woodhull<00:07:39.599> basically<00:07:40.439> hold<00:07:40.620> the

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:40.709 
this if I do Woodhull basically hold the

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:44.360 
this if I do Woodhull basically hold the
vacuum<00:07:41.069> oh<00:07:41.279> so<00:07:42.209> the<00:07:43.169> vacuum<00:07:43.499> system<00:07:43.830> I<00:07:43.919> had<00:07:43.949> or

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
vacuum oh so the vacuum system I had or

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.119 
vacuum oh so the vacuum system I had or
could<00:07:44.669> acquire<00:07:45.180> for<00:07:45.749> the<00:07:45.930> price<00:07:46.199> basically

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:47.129 
could acquire for the price basically

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.809 
could acquire for the price basically
isn't<00:07:47.399> it<00:07:47.580> suck<00:07:48.389> up<00:07:48.539> a<00:07:48.689> lot<00:07:48.719> of<00:07:48.870> those<00:07:49.050> chips

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:49.819 
isn't it suck up a lot of those chips

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.969 
isn't it suck up a lot of those chips
how<00:07:50.819> I<00:07:50.849> wanted<00:07:51.300> it<00:07:51.419> to<00:07:51.719> without<00:07:52.050> a<00:07:52.199> really<00:07:52.680> high

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 
how I wanted it to without a really high

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:57.649 
how I wanted it to without a really high
volume<00:07:53.639> high<00:07:53.909> pressure<00:07:54.569> high<00:07:55.110> vacuum<00:07:56.060> so<00:07:57.060> with

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:57.659 
volume high pressure high vacuum so with

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.050 
volume high pressure high vacuum so with
that<00:07:57.749> being<00:07:57.899> said<00:07:58.020> hopefully<00:07:58.849> figure<00:07:59.849> this

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 
that being said hopefully figure this

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.129 
that being said hopefully figure this
out<00:08:00.240> and<00:08:00.509> somebody<00:08:01.229> back<00:08:01.469> me<00:08:01.499> thank<00:08:02.039> you
