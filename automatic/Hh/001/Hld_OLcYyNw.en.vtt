some<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.810> you<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.230> asked<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.740> do<00:00:01.860> more

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
some of you have asked that I do more

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.820 
some of you have asked that I do more
videos<00:00:02.909> covering<00:00:03.480> 3d<00:00:04.049> printing<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.589> just

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
videos covering 3d printing and just

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.980 
videos covering 3d printing and just
some<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.160> prototypes<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:06.089> I've<00:00:06.810> been

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
some of the prototypes that I've been

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.570 
some of the prototypes that I've been
working<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.919> thought<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.429> was<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
working on and I thought that was a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.820 
working on and I thought that was a
great<00:00:08.849> suggestion<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.170> briefly<00:00:10.380> wanted<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
great suggestion and I briefly wanted to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.249 
great suggestion and I briefly wanted to
share<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> couple<00:00:11.340> tips<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.750> I've<00:00:12.870> been<00:00:13.049> using

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
share a couple tips that I've been using

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.460 
share a couple tips that I've been using
just<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:14.009> minimize<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.969> amount<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.450> PLA<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
just to minimize the amount of PLA that

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.740 
just to minimize the amount of PLA that
I<00:00:17.070> print<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.699> when<00:00:18.090> working<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> new

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I print with when working on a new

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.710 
I print with when working on a new
prototype<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> new<00:00:20.880> quad<00:00:21.359> design

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
prototype so this is a new quad design

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.120 
prototype so this is a new quad design
I've<00:00:22.109> been<00:00:22.260> working<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.800> actually<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I've been working on it's actually a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.800 
I've been working on it's actually a
two-piece<00:00:23.609> design<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
two-piece design some of the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.200 
two-piece design some of the
requirements<00:00:25.410> were<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:26.039> wanted<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
requirements were that I wanted this to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
requirements were that I wanted this to
have<00:00:27.390> less<00:00:28.199> pieces<00:00:28.560> than<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> previous

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have less pieces than the previous

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.609 
have less pieces than the previous
version<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> designed<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:31.470> as

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
version that I designed as well as

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
version that I designed as well as
making<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.189> easier<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.000> assemble<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.320> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
making it easier to assemble and when I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
making it easier to assemble and when I
get<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> build<00:00:34.860> log<00:00:35.040> complete<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.940> guy

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
get the build log complete and this guy

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.910 
get the build log complete and this guy
in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> air<00:00:36.780> I'll<00:00:36.989> definitely<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.530> sharing

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
in the air I'll definitely be sharing

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
in the air I'll definitely be sharing
all<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.149> garage<00:00:39.420> pilots<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.079> well<00:00:40.110> as

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
all of that on garage pilots as well as

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.770 
all of that on garage pilots as well as
posting<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.219> design<00:00:41.820> files<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.360> Thingiverse

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
posting the design files on Thingiverse

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
posting the design files on Thingiverse
but<00:00:43.440> when<00:00:43.590> working<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> design<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.850> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
but when working on a design like this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
but when working on a design like this
she<00:00:45.180> could<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.950> several<00:00:46.950> iterations

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
she could really do several iterations

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.940 
she could really do several iterations
of<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.870> doing<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> lot

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of it and so in doing that there's a lot

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
of it and so in doing that there's a lot
of<00:00:50.210> PLA<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> you're<00:00:51.600> using<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.350> are

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of PLA that you're using so there are

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
of PLA that you're using so there are
two<00:00:52.680> main<00:00:52.890> things<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
two main things that I do one is that I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
two main things that I do one is that I
print<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> low<00:00:55.710> resolution<00:00:56.149> just<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.420> how

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
print in low resolution just to see how

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.080 
print in low resolution just to see how
everything<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.199> spaced<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.030> know

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
everything is spaced out and you know

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.819 
everything is spaced out and you know
how<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.359> looks<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> feels<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.590> hands

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
how it looks and feels in my hands

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
how it looks and feels in my hands
obviously<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> great<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.300> about

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
obviously that's the great thing about

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
obviously that's the great thing about
3d<00:01:03.870> printing<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:05.070> part<00:01:05.369> took<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.820> one

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
3d printing now this part took about one

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.679 
3d printing now this part took about one
hour<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.380> used<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.950> 10%<00:01:08.280> infill<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.479> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hour and I used that 10% infill so with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
hour and I used that 10% infill so with
that<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.229> obviously<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.220> as

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that it's obviously not going to be as

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640 
that it's obviously not going to be as
durable<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.479> rigid<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.350> friend<00:01:13.530> will<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
durable or rigid but your friend will be

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.480 
durable or rigid but your friend will be
a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.950> faster<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.810> you'll<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:16.049> less<00:01:16.100> PLA<00:01:17.100> or

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a lot faster and you'll use less PLA or

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.890 
a lot faster and you'll use less PLA or
whatever<00:01:17.759> material<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.450> printing<00:01:18.689> away

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
whatever material you're printing away

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.550 
whatever material you're printing away
and<00:01:19.470> once<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> design<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> finalized<00:01:20.850> I'll

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
and once the design is finalized I'll

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.469 
and once the design is finalized I'll
take<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.740> infill<00:01:23.189> which<00:01:23.549> U<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
take that infill which U is just a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
take that infill which U is just a
setting<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.930> makerware<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.680> I'll<00:01:25.770> bump<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
setting and makerware and I'll bump that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.440 
setting and makerware and I'll bump that
up<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.840> probably<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:28.020> 75%<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
up to probably around 75% and do the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
up to probably around 75% and do the
print<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> higher<00:01:31.380> resolution<00:01:31.680> okay<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
print at a higher resolution okay the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.060 
print at a higher resolution okay the
other<00:01:32.700> tip<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.740> see

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
other tip that I have is you can see

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.499 
other tip that I have is you can see
there<00:01:35.250> these<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.729> tabs<00:01:35.970> coming<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there these little tabs coming off of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
there these little tabs coming off of
here<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
here and this is the other side of it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.899 
here and this is the other side of it
and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.150> goal<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.909> nicely

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and the goal is to have this just nicely

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
and the goal is to have this just nicely
snap<00:01:42.689> together<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.100> CA<00:01:44.340> glue

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
snap together a little bit of CA glue

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
hold that firmly in place so while you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280 
hold that firmly in place so while you

I'm<00:01:49.500> using<00:01:49.680> rhino3d<00:01:50.149> these<00:01:51.149> tabs<00:01:51.479> look<00:01:51.869> look

I'm using rhino3d these tabs look look

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.420 
I'm using rhino3d these tabs look look
good<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.799> definitely<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.369> make

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
good but you definitely want to make

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.700 
good but you definitely want to make
sure<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.060> fit<00:01:54.329> together<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:55.590> could

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
sure that they fit together you could

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.859 
sure that they fit together you could
imagine<00:01:55.950> printing<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.820> other<00:01:57.030> half<00:01:57.299> for

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
imagine printing this other half for

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.959 
imagine printing this other half for
about<00:01:58.079> an<00:01:58.200> hour<00:01:58.350> using<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.979> bunch<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> PLA<00:01:59.729> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
about an hour using a bunch of PLA and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.789 
about an hour using a bunch of PLA and
coming<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> realization<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.619> maybe

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
coming to the realization that maybe

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.940 
coming to the realization that maybe
your<00:02:02.070> tabs<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> alignment<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
your tabs are out of alignment or you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
your tabs are out of alignment or you
know<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.610> shrinkage<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> PLA

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
know because of shrinkage of the PLA

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.589 
know because of shrinkage of the PLA
this<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.459> may<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.670> fit<00:02:08.970> perfectly

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
this thing may not fit perfectly

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.750 
this thing may not fit perfectly
together<00:02:09.840> what<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.860> overcome<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.730> I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
together what I do to overcome that is I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
together what I do to overcome that is I
just<00:02:11.940> take<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> little<00:02:12.510> section

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
just take a little section

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
just take a little section
of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.950> design<00:02:14.070> out<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of the design out you can see that's a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.530 
of the design out you can see that's a
little<00:02:15.690> female<00:02:16.590> end<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> tab<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
little female end of the tab and I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.660 
little female end of the tab and I
printed<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.050> before<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> printed<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.370> left

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
printed this before I printed this left

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.270 
printed this before I printed this left
half<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:22.350> slid<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> make

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
half and just slid it on there to make

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.070 
half and just slid it on there to make
sure<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.820> fits<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
sure that it fits so you can see that I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.630 
sure that it fits so you can see that I
used<00:02:25.910> obviously<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> lot<00:02:27.300> less<00:02:27.510> PLA<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
used obviously a lot less PLA and the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.330 
used obviously a lot less PLA and the
design<00:02:30.000> fit<00:02:30.450> nicely<00:02:30.720> had<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.710> tweak<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.130> once

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
design fit nicely had to tweak it once

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.120 
design fit nicely had to tweak it once
or<00:02:32.550> twice<00:02:32.630> but<00:02:33.630> got<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.050> size<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.070> of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
or twice but got to a size that kind of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.370 
or twice but got to a size that kind of
accommodate<00:02:36.000> snapping<00:02:36.840> these<00:02:36.960> two<00:02:37.230> together

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
accommodate snapping these two together

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.160 
accommodate snapping these two together
and<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.700> last<00:02:38.910> tip<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> did

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and one last tip that I have that I did

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440 
and one last tip that I have that I did
prior<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.490> design<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.090> guys<00:02:42.240> see

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
prior to the design that you guys see

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
prior to the design that you guys see
here<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.560> five<00:02:43.890> millimeters<00:02:44.160> thick

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
here is this is five millimeters thick

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.610 
here is this is five millimeters thick
actually<00:02:45.690> only<00:02:45.900> printed<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.350> three

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
actually only printed it three

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.740 
actually only printed it three
millimeters<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.700> could<00:02:47.940> get<00:02:48.120> once

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
millimeters just so I could get once

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.300 
millimeters just so I could get once
again<00:02:49.080> something<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.680> could<00:02:49.920> hold<00:02:50.070> my

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
again something that I could hold my

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.270 
again something that I could hold my
hands<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.200> verify<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.470> everything<00:02:53.040> looks

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
hands and verify that everything looks

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.110 
hands and verify that everything looks
okay<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.960> obviously<00:02:55.110> uses<00:02:55.800> less<00:02:56.040> PLA<00:02:56.610> as

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
okay so that obviously uses less PLA as

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.320 
okay so that obviously uses less PLA as
well<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:58.280> once<00:02:59.280> again<00:02:59.460> hopefully<00:02:59.910> I'll<00:03:00.180> have

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
well and once again hopefully I'll have

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.210 
well and once again hopefully I'll have
this<00:03:00.480> design<00:03:00.900> ready<00:03:01.230> within<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.740> next<00:03:01.980> week

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
this design ready within the next week

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.520 
this design ready within the next week
