00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.330 
disappointed and the way this tape is
designed<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.300> very<00:00:39.300> similar<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.469> ipg

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

designed is very similar to the ipg
brand<00:00:41.730> camo<00:00:42.590> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.550> way<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.590> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
brand camo in the way that it's just

brand camo in the way that it's just
like<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> wish<00:00:47.309> they<00:00:47.610> did<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.270> camo

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579
