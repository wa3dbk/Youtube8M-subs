and yes very similar to tremolo we got
some<00:03:23.470> phaser<00:03:31.830> octave<00:03:32.830> er<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.250> don't<00:03:34.120> really

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
some phaser octave er I don't really

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:46.199 
some phaser octave er I don't really
need<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.260> that's<00:03:44.680> about<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:45.010> um<00:03:45.459> other

where you could save your stuff has
these<00:03:50.200> equalizers<00:03:50.830> right<00:03:51.010> here<00:03:51.450> has<00:03:52.450> reverb

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
these equalizers right here has reverb

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.380 
these equalizers right here has reverb
and<00:03:53.110> delay<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:55.870> about<00:03:56.140> it
