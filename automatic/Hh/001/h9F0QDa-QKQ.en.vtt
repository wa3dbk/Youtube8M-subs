00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
Hey and we're going to try and get the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.050 
Hey and we're going to try and get the
motivator<00:00:03.820> going<00:00:04.149> in<00:00:04.660> two<00:00:04.990> turns<00:00:05.290> of<00:00:05.440> a<00:00:05.560> hand

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
motivator going in two turns of a hand

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.260 
motivator going in two turns of a hand
okay

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
okay

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.910 
okay
demonstrating<00:00:07.839> that<00:00:07.899> can<00:00:08.139> be<00:00:08.320> quite<00:00:08.500> easy<00:00:08.559> to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
demonstrating that can be quite easy to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.400 
demonstrating that can be quite easy to
start<00:00:09.540> okay<00:00:10.540> we<00:00:10.719> have<00:00:10.870> obviously<00:00:11.200> two

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
start okay we have obviously two

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.140 
start okay we have obviously two
containers<00:00:11.800> on<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.519> top<00:00:12.700> gear<00:00:12.880> where<00:00:13.059> the

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
containers on the top gear where the

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.270 
containers on the top gear where the
fuel<00:00:13.420> goes<00:00:13.599> diesel<00:00:14.590> goes<00:00:14.740> in<00:00:14.920> this<00:00:15.040> one

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
fuel goes diesel goes in this one

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.269 
fuel goes diesel goes in this one
two-stroke<00:00:16.180> oil<00:00:16.299> goes<00:00:16.660> in<00:00:16.840> that<00:00:17.020> one<00:00:17.279> don't

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
two-stroke oil goes in that one don't

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.550 
two-stroke oil goes in that one don't
let<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:18.520> run<00:00:18.670> out<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:18.940> Iver<00:00:19.210> okay<00:00:20.020> I<00:00:20.050> was<00:00:20.320> yet<00:00:20.529> I

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
let it run out of Iver okay I was yet I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.880 
let it run out of Iver okay I was yet I
would<00:00:20.920> bleed<00:00:21.189> the<00:00:21.580> diesel<00:00:22.539> out<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:23.050> if<00:00:23.800> you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
would bleed the diesel out and if you

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.250 
would bleed the diesel out and if you
run<00:00:24.039> out<00:00:24.070> of<00:00:24.220> two-stroke<00:00:24.850> then<00:00:25.510> you<00:00:25.689> can<00:00:25.960> cause

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
run out of two-stroke then you can cause

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.070 
run out of two-stroke then you can cause
yeah<00:00:26.830> probably<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.150> two-stroke<00:00:28.599> engines

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
yeah probably to the two-stroke engines

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
yeah probably to the two-stroke engines
and<00:00:29.380> runs<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.460> our<00:00:30.550> way<00:00:31.199> okay<00:00:32.230> at<00:00:32.649> this<00:00:32.800> end

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
and runs and our way okay at this end

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.940 
and runs and our way okay at this end
okay<00:00:33.610> simple<00:00:34.510> controls<00:00:35.050> we<00:00:35.290> have<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.469> portal

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
okay simple controls we have a portal

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.360 
okay simple controls we have a portal
lever<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:37.329> here<00:00:37.750> this<00:00:38.260> is<00:00:38.559> probably<00:00:39.190> not<00:00:39.309> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
lever on here this is probably not the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.430 
lever on here this is probably not the
probably<00:00:39.850> needs<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.059> new<00:00:40.210> cable<00:00:40.719> which<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:41.050> had

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
probably needs a new cable which is had

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.619 
probably needs a new cable which is had
better<00:00:41.710> days<00:00:42.010> but<00:00:42.460> I<00:00:42.489> described<00:00:43.090> back

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
better days but I described back

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.000 
better days but I described back
that's<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.590> clutch<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:47.110> here<00:00:47.500> we<00:00:47.710> have<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
that's a clutch down here we have the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.619 
that's a clutch down here we have the
gear<00:00:48.219> selection<00:00:48.670> okay

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
gear selection okay

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.709 
gear selection okay
got<00:00:49.960> forward<00:00:50.460> by<00:00:51.460> three<00:00:51.820> ways<00:00:52.030> three<00:00:52.420> gears

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
got forward by three ways three gears

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.350 
got forward by three ways three gears
and<00:00:53.020> one<00:00:53.199> reverse<00:00:53.620> push<00:00:54.340> down<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.940> put<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.239> in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
and one reverse push down to put it in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.740 
and one reverse push down to put it in
reverse<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:00.969> here<00:01:01.329> this

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
reverse like that this one here this

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
reverse like that this one here this
lever<00:01:02.050> here<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.590> engages<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.479> motivator

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
lever here that engages the motivator

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
lever here that engages the motivator
you<00:01:06.700> don't<00:01:06.939> really<00:01:07.119> clutch<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.650> then

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
you don't really clutch it in and then

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.080 
you don't really clutch it in and then
out<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.760> goes<00:01:10.799> secondly<00:01:11.799> lever<00:01:12.040> here<00:01:12.490> purely

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
out it goes secondly lever here purely

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.940 
out it goes secondly lever here purely
is<00:01:13.510> for<00:01:13.810> very<00:01:14.650> concerned<00:01:15.159> handlebars<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:17.650> so

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
is for very concerned handlebars like so

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.830 
is for very concerned handlebars like so
so<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.610> don't<00:01:18.820> actually<00:01:19.000> have<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.270> walk<00:01:19.509> in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
so you don't actually have to walk in

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
so you don't actually have to walk in
here<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.140> actually<00:01:20.920> motivate<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:22.540> hand

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.700 

that's<00:01:26.110> for<00:01:26.260> middle

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
that's for middle

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.660 
that's for middle
I<00:01:26.740> set<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.640> throttle<00:01:29.490> probably<00:01:30.490> about

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
I set the throttle probably about

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.310 
I set the throttle probably about
halfway<00:01:31.260> equals<00:01:32.260> away

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.210 

but<00:01:36.920> fuels<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.450> always<00:01:39.080> need<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.350> few<00:01:39.650> long

what's used to detect Li like a glow pug
so<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.260> unscrew<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:24.320> go<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.740> tool<00:02:24.980> box

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
so you unscrew it you go to a tool box

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.910 
so you unscrew it you go to a tool box
you<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.780> glove<00:02:27.820> double<00:02:28.820> knee<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:30.140> in

you have the glove double knee and in
here<00:02:31.310> there's<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.390> piece<00:02:32.600> of<00:02:32.840> string<00:02:33.700> which<00:02:34.700> has

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
here there's a piece of string which has

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.260 
here there's a piece of string which has
been<00:02:35.480> coated<00:02:36.020> in<00:02:36.260> fear<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.880> cut<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> little

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
been coated in fear so we cut a little

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.270 
been coated in fear so we cut a little
bit<00:02:38.420> off<00:02:38.540> usually<00:02:38.989> about<00:02:39.290> an<00:02:39.410> inch<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:39.830> and
