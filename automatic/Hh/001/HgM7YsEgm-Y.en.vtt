00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.560
 I remember that we were just two kids when we meet each other 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.220
 It was a night like this, and the time was short 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.820
 Flat, I remember was raining, nothing going around 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 We were so close, but ALTHOUGH FAR AWAY 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.160
 You were thinking that our love is on scale 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.040
 I was thinking that for me IT IS NOT ANY HOPE 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.560
 Everything for us was so strange 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.240
 You were laughing, and I was writhing lyrics on a bench from the park 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.820
 Even that we were just at begining 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.040
 I felt that for us 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.640
 IS NOTHING TO DO 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.000
 And so easy, the dream was crumbling every day 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.660
 Remembering how happy I was 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.060
 DREAMING TO HAVE KIDS 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 I was in the 9th sky then, you remember 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.220
 When we were spending all the same days like two kids 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.800
 And like this time pass, like pass one year 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.120
 And when we saw each other 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.780
 LIKE WE NEVER MEET BEFORE 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.040
 A few years pass, you never show up 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.100
 We did our life 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.971
 I WENT WHERE I COULD 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.420
 You did not want anymore, you found someone else 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.060
 That you were loving him, just playing all the time in his bed 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.460
 And life for you was so good 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.340
 Everything was good for you, I did not even have money for a chewing gum 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.900
 But I was watching you all the time from distance with tears in my eyes 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.200
 Thinking what to say 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900
 IF YOU APPEAR IN MY FACE 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.680
 I remember how I was smiling when I was watching you how beautiful you were 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 But I was loosing myself when you were going in his luxury car 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.440
 I remember how naughty you were 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 Even you loved me, quaintly, you wanted to be a harp 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 So many tears were falling from my empty eyes 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.860
 That you were loving so munch, and us 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 We were hiding our love, for no one to know 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.860
 I'm waiting for you, my only philosophy 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.600
 Now, so long, I start growing 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100
 I start to have some fun, and forget everything 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.900
 I met a girl, we met and liked each other 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.440
 We loved, and we did 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.034
 EVERYTHING WE WANTED 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520
 Now my life is good, I see that she really love me 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.080
 And I love her, she's making my sunny days 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.540
 And you, how are you, I heard that he left you 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 HE LEFT YOU HOME ALONE, HE GOT DRUNK AND LEFT 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660
 And now you regret what you did, but it's late 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.440
 What you've got is gone 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000
 I WILL NOT BE THERE 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.620
 And I know how you feel, even if I loved you 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.140
 I FEEL GREAT WITH ME, I DO NOT WANT YOU ANYMORE 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.500
 I was lost, you 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.800
 YOU CHASED ME 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.440
 You did not care about anything that I wanted to say 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.820
 I was you but you let me go 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.180
 Nice meeting you 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.280
