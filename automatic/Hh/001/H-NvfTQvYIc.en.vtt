the<00:03:51.250> thing<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.900> right<00:03:52.900> now<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.200> doesn't<00:03:53.320> work

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the thing is right now it doesn't work

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.570 
the thing is right now it doesn't work
it<00:03:54.760> did<00:03:55.090> work<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.690> tested<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.440> out<00:03:56.590> before<00:03:57.220> I

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
it did work I tested it out before I

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.240 
it did work I tested it out before I
purchased<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.570> was<00:03:58.720> working

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
purchased it and it was working

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.640 
purchased it and it was working
somewhere<00:04:00.250> along<00:04:00.670> delivery<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:02.260> stopped

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
somewhere along delivery it stopped

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.220 
somewhere along delivery it stopped
working<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:04.120> I'm<00:04:04.360> hoping<00:04:04.570> it's<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:05.019> loose

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
working so I'm hoping it's just a loose

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.920 
working so I'm hoping it's just a loose
wire<00:04:05.500> maybe<00:04:06.360> something<00:04:07.360> came<00:04:07.510> off<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.780> power

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
wire maybe something came off the power

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.660 
wire maybe something came off the power
supply<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:09.400> all<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.519> know<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.720> could<00:04:10.750> be<00:04:11.670> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
supply for all I know it could be the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.760 
supply for all I know it could be the
power<00:04:12.850> cable<00:04:13.330> is<00:04:13.450> bad

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
power cable is bad

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.259 
power cable is bad
so<00:04:14.770> I<00:04:14.800> have<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.130> see<00:04:15.280> about<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.180> I

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
this I drilled out I sort of made a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.350 
this I drilled out I sort of made a
little<00:04:59.230> video<00:04:59.410> about<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.980> I'll<00:05:00.460> probably<00:05:00.730> put

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.480 

basically<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:06.700> didn't<00:05:07.180> come<00:05:07.300> with<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.450> keys

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
basically I didn't come with the keys

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.790 
basically I didn't come with the keys
yeah<00:05:09.490> I'll<00:05:09.580> put<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:09.850> up<00:05:09.970> maybe<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.300> won't

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800

anyways<00:05:11.800> like<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.190> said<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> nice<00:05:12.580> cabinet<00:05:13.530> this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
anyways like I said a nice cabinet this

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.320 
anyways like I said a nice cabinet this
is<00:05:14.680> obviously<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.250> normal<00:05:15.669> version<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:16.180> not

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
is obviously the normal version it's not

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.960 
is obviously the normal version it's not
the<00:05:16.450> huge<00:05:16.690> giant<00:05:17.169> version<00:05:17.620> we<00:05:18.250> have<00:05:18.430> actually

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
the huge giant version we have actually

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.300 
the huge giant version we have actually
a<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.690> body<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.169> motorcycle<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.070> believe

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
a the body of a motorcycle and I believe

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.930 
a the body of a motorcycle and I believe
it<00:05:21.460> goes<00:05:21.580> back<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:22.030> forth<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:24.550> other<00:05:24.700> thing

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
it goes back and forth the other thing

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.540 
it goes back and forth the other thing
that's<00:05:25.030> weird

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
that's weird

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.390 
that's weird
now<00:05:27.550> I'm<00:05:28.090> no<00:05:28.600> motorcycle<00:05:29.140> XAR<00:05:29.530> expert<00:05:30.100> but

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
now I'm no motorcycle XAR expert but

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.860 
now I'm no motorcycle XAR expert but
that<00:05:31.110> also<00:05:32.110> acts<00:05:32.590> as<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.910> brake<00:05:36.090> so<00:05:37.090> it's<00:05:37.690> kind

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
that also acts as the brake so it's kind

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.020 
that also acts as the brake so it's kind
of<00:05:37.960> weird<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.440> don't<00:05:38.890> think<00:05:39.280> motorcycles<00:05:39.880> have

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
of weird I don't think motorcycles have

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.440 
of weird I don't think motorcycles have
brakes<00:05:40.390> down<00:05:40.630> here<00:05:42.120> pretty<00:05:43.120> sure<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.390> only

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
brakes down here pretty sure the only

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.800 
brakes down here pretty sure the only
brake<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.229> one<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:45.030> is<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.300> clutch

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
brake is this one and is the clutch

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.580 
brake is this one and is the clutch
