00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
know and that's really what in my

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.729 
know and that's really what in my

getting both consoles you know just

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.890 
getting both consoles you know just

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
because PlayStation 4 looks insane and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.030 
because PlayStation 4 looks insane and

forward<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.340> what's<00:04:05.579> in<00:04:05.699> the<00:04:05.819> future<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.769> Xbox

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
forward to what's in the future on Xbox

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.670 
forward to what's in the future on Xbox
I<00:04:08.459> believe<00:04:09.030> they<00:04:09.739> took<00:04:10.739> back<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.280> constant

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
I believe they took back the constant

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.229 
I believe they took back the constant
connection<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.250> alive<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> think<00:04:14.970> they<00:04:15.090> took

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
connection to alive I think they took

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.969 
connection to alive I think they took
that<00:04:15.419> back<00:04:15.629> and<00:04:15.870> also<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.709> rental<00:04:17.099> thing<00:04:18.979> but

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
that back and also the rental thing but

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.979 
that back and also the rental thing but
