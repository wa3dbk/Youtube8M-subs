00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.350
 hello friends today 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.920
 I bring a subject that interested me quite 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.870
 and good let's start 3 real vampires of 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.930
 the story far from the fictions 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.050
 modern fluorescent vampires 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.330
 beautiful and delicate the mythical figure of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.460
 sinister and unpleasant to be grotesque 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.410
 of the vampire was forged in various 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.019
 cultures of the world throughout the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.960
 story when we think about these 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.600
 peculiar beings the idea of ​​bloodsucker 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.200
 immortal comes to mind 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.400
 righ now 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.080
 notwithstanding certain characters 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.210
 present not only in folklore but 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.790
 also in the historical records of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.670
 antiquity have fueled the myth of 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.070
 vampirism in an exceptional way for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.350
 understand a little more about this myth 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.540
 today I'm going to show you some of them 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.850
 take a look at these three vampires 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.580
 reals of history 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.350
 Elizabeth Bator and the Bloody Countess 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.720
 history is full of terrible 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.420
 sadistic serial killers and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 personalities plagued by 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.259
 psychopathology is that in any other 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.259
 context would make them ruthless 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.600
 criminals although little of this is 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.360
 He mentioned in antiquity as 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.430
 it was easier to give them vampires 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.759
 not so that's what happened in the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.890
 most full 16th century countess 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.200
 Lizarra and third the Báthory was a good 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.540
 example of it a megalomania that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.180
 killer cereal that from the top of 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.670
 the seen Bulgarian grace had fun with 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.460
 torture , murder and abuse of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.369
 farmers 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.170
 the bloody countess as she was called 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.510
 after being prosecuted for 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.950
 his atrocities on women with more 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.080
 homicides of the history of the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.080
 humanity of which ten are sold 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.340
 nothing with the beauty of the idea of ​​the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.649
 eternal life murdered at least 80 people 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.740
 and although it has not been possible to corroborate 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.469
 estimated that they were actually more than 650 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.410
 according to the stories collector and cos 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.690
 local this delirious woman was bathing 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.970
 with the blood of virgin maidens of 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.580
 the region to stay young and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.650
 beautiful although it should be noted that many 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.040
 are the historians who disagree with 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.410
 this postulate after his trial 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.560
 bator and was sentenced desportiva to be 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.329
 walled alive in this way locked 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 in one of the walls of his castle with 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.069
 enough space to receive 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.560
 air of food after years of 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.470
 agony behind the walls the Countess stopped 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.390
 exist without doubt is a story that 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.730
 contributed a lot to the grandson of vampirism and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.680
 although we may never know what motivated 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 a mind as dysfunctional as that of 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.720
 vãctor and the case still draws attention 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.840
 of numerous anthropological researchers 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.150
 and historians swear by recording the first 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.280
 vampire happens great takes a place 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.000
 fundamental in what could be called the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 vampirism 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.290
 since in essence in the first 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.630
 person that appears in a record 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 historical under the nominalization of 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.880
 vampires was an old peasant of the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.040
 gray peninsula tri pressure that today 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.250
 they make up the territories of croatia 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.830
 Slovenia Italy from which we can see 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.110
 part in the image is therefore a 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.630
 fundamental figure in the folklore of 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.670
 vampire 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 although you do not know the date of your 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.100
 birth swear grando have already 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 died in the year one thousand 656 but not 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.470
 really up to thousand 672 so not before 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.530
 have terrorized the inhabitants of 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.930
 the region for about sixteen years in 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.420
 the documents the locals called them 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.520
 the stri with which translates as the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.560
 vampire and according to there it says the 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.570
 villagers were handcuffed during the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.430
 night when this man toured the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.490
 people knocking on the door of their 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.010
 homes still after dead a day 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.170
 next a member of the family who 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.930
 he had received the blows devouring in 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.930
 his door the dawn dead 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.430
 small townspeople sick of the situation 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.070
 they decided to face this man in 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 company of the priest of the place of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 according to what are mentioned 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.130
 documents after desecrating the grave of 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 brando and in the name of God expel 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.959
 at the stri with many tears sprouted 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.140
 of the eyes of the corpse which was removed 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.230
 of the grave and was beheaded today this 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.670
 place has great anthropological value 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.850
 cultural history and of course 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.510
 tourist 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.330

 be otherwise vlad tepes the impaler 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.520
 is a more than fundamental part of the 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.940
 formulation of the vampire myth and in the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.020
 characteristic bloodsucker figure 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.920
 especially after the fictionalization 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.610
 that bram stoker made him in the year 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.190
 1897 with his staff on the other hand and I what 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.290
 placed in that strange mythical place between 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.110
 fiction and reality is necessary 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.540
 mention that the stoker novel itself 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.760
 also aroused a deep interest 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.770
 scientist and the historical figure of 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.800

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.710
 the third best known as vlad tepes 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.110

 Romania this war network a strategist 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.580
 like none else where you want the 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.129
 the killer's freedom while it 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.289
 turned white Catholicism a 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.449
 fervent orthodox pertaining to the

 expansion taken that he struggled to release 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.409
 Romania of German power a look 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.780
 Turkish but his story was really 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.729
 dura black became a figure 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.650
 very striking because of its immense 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.599
 cruelty especially at the time of 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.300
 punish anyone who opposed 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.370
 his commands or worse still betray him 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.740
 the punishment that gave his name 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.020
 it consisted of placing a stick in the rectum 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.150
 of his enemies that then something that 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.090
 It was at a height of about 35 meters 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.780
 for days this resulted in one of the 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.389
 first forms of wars 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.700
 that is known since when the lines 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.070
 enemies came to the dark forests 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.780
 and mountains of tail that were 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.830
 with hundreds of naked men and 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.920
 bloodied agonizing in this way 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.230
 Of course that was not all during his 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.990
 apogee after he was commissioned to deliver 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.940
 badges dissect mentally and from 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.520
 focus on countless enemies that 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.560
 scattered through the region these always 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.230
 they were used to provoke fear 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.900
 of the invaders that in front of like 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.200
 landscapes left the mountains so soon 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.450
 as they could with such a panorama the 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.430
 figure of the atp was not long in occupying a 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.800
 supreme place within the myth of the 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.930
 Vampires mentioned numerous stories 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.780
 Germanic as an abominable being that 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.480
