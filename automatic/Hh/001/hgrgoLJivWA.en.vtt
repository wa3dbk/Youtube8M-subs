from the the world last bubbles come see
every<00:00:56.020> year<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.380> it's<00:00:57.340> always<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.610> good

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
every year so it's always a good

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.370 
every year so it's always a good

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
full of entries and I think even more

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.670

people<00:01:03.879> wanted<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.420> come<00:01:04.600> so<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.410> just<00:01:05.440> makes

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
people wanted to come so it just makes

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:19.540 
people wanted to come so it just makes
it<00:01:05.770> all<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:05.979> long<00:01:06.070> like<00:01:06.190> something<00:01:06.790> special

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.520 

the<00:01:20.240> competition<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:20.900> very<00:01:20.990> high<00:01:21.320> because

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
the competition is very high because

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.860 
the competition is very high because
these<00:01:22.070> parts<00:01:22.640> are<00:01:22.820> built<00:01:23.300> according<00:01:23.660> to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
these parts are built according to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.890 
these parts are built according to
normal<00:01:24.650> kids<00:01:24.860> usage<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.850> tuning<00:01:26.390> parts<00:01:26.570> is

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
normal kids usage of tuning parts is

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.610 
normal kids usage of tuning parts is
limited<00:01:27.350> therefore<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:28.490> more<00:01:28.790> about<00:01:29.620> the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
limited therefore it's more about the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.850

hundred<00:02:10.369> fifty<00:02:10.640> euros<00:02:11.000> even<00:02:11.600> including<00:02:12.050> spare

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
hundred fifty euros even including spare

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.470 
hundred fifty euros even including spare
batteries<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.430> can<00:02:13.640> off<00:02:13.790> goal<00:02:14.060> on

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
batteries and then you can off goal on

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.680 
batteries and then you can off goal on
the<00:02:14.690> racetrack

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.030
