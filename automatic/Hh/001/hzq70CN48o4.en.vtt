00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
Youngjae Lee my personal research is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.140 
Youngjae Lee my personal research is
centered<00:00:21.950> on<00:00:21.980> object<00:00:22.340> recognition<00:00:22.489> but<00:00:23.029> this

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
centered on object recognition but this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.550 
centered on object recognition but this
is<00:00:23.270> one<00:00:23.419> application<00:00:23.540> of<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:24.200> which<00:00:24.320> I<00:00:24.439> thought

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
is one application of it which I thought

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.109 
is one application of it which I thought
it'd<00:00:24.680> just<00:00:24.770> be<00:00:24.950> fun<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.310> kind<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.520> test<00:00:25.730> out<00:00:25.880> and

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
it'd just be fun to kind of test out and

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.749 
it'd just be fun to kind of test out and
demo<00:00:27.079> so<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.890> project<00:00:28.189> is<00:00:28.340> called<00:00:28.489> shadow

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
demo so the project is called shadow

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.909 
demo so the project is called shadow
draw<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.869> goal<00:00:30.020> of<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.529> really<00:00:30.800> to

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
draw and the goal of it is really to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.010 
draw and the goal of it is really to
make<00:00:31.070> drawing<00:00:31.550> more<00:00:31.700> fun<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.630> enable<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.989> to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
make drawing more fun to enable you to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020 
make drawing more fun to enable you to
be<00:00:33.170> more<00:00:33.350> creative<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:33.950> also<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.640> make<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
be more creative and also to make the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.430 
be more creative and also to make the
result<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.660> your<00:00:35.809> drawing<00:00:36.079> be<00:00:36.230> more

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
result of your drawing be more

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.040 
result of your drawing be more
impressive<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.490> better<00:00:38.390> quality<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.020> that

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
impressive and better quality so that

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.470 
impressive and better quality so that
you<00:00:39.200> enjoy<00:00:39.650> drawing<00:00:39.920> more<00:00:40.250> now<00:00:41.060> with<00:00:41.240> shadow

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
you enjoy drawing more now with shadow

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560 
you enjoy drawing more now with shadow
draw<00:00:41.810> I'll<00:00:42.140> start<00:00:42.590> drawing<00:00:42.830> and<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:44.180> program

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
draw I'll start drawing and the program

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.120 
draw I'll start drawing and the program
automatically<00:00:45.170> recognizes<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:45.980> you're

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
automatically recognizes what you're

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.170 
automatically recognizes what you're
drawing<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:46.700> tries<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:46.940> offer

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
drawing and then tries to offer

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.210 
drawing and then tries to offer
suggestions<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:47.990> the<00:00:48.500> more<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:48.740> draw<00:00:49.010> all<00:00:49.130> the

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
suggestions and the more I draw all the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.890 
suggestions and the more I draw all the
more<00:00:49.370> specific<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:49.940> gets<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.630> more

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
more specific it gets and the more

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.220 
more specific it gets and the more
accurate<00:00:51.740> the<00:00:51.770> recommendations<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.790> has

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
accurate the recommendations it has

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.480 
accurate the recommendations it has
becomes<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.780> you<00:01:00.590> see<00:01:00.829> my<00:01:00.950> final<00:01:01.250> drawing

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
becomes so you see my final drawing

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.060 
becomes so you see my final drawing
looks<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.730> bit<00:01:01.760> more<00:01:02.000> realistic<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.980> way

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
looks a bit more realistic so the way

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.520 
looks a bit more realistic so the way
this<00:01:04.220> works<00:01:04.489> is<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.329> it<00:01:05.600> actually<00:01:05.840> matches<00:01:06.200> my

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
this works is it it actually matches my

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.710 
this works is it it actually matches my
drawing<00:01:07.009> to<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.159> database<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.670> images<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.390> in

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
drawing to a database of images and in

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.179 
drawing to a database of images and in
this<00:01:08.899> implementation<00:01:09.740> here<00:01:09.920> we<00:01:10.069> actually

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
this implementation here we actually

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.010 
this implementation here we actually
have<00:01:10.369> 30,000<00:01:11.090> images<00:01:11.240> collected<00:01:11.749> from<00:01:11.840> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
have 30,000 images collected from the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.959 
have 30,000 images collected from the
web<00:01:12.170> basically<00:01:12.710> anything<00:01:13.219> you<00:01:13.369> think<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.880> that

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
web basically anything you think of that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.309 
web basically anything you think of that
you<00:01:14.090> might<00:01:14.119> want<00:01:14.420> to<00:01:14.450> draw<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:14.810> try<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.020> put<00:01:15.229> in

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
you might want to draw we try to put in

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.309 
you might want to draw we try to put in
a<00:01:15.409> database<00:01:16.749> bicycle<00:01:17.749> something<00:01:18.049> else<00:01:18.170> that

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
a database bicycle something else that

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.510 
a database bicycle something else that
people<00:01:18.439> have<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> really<00:01:18.920> hard<00:01:19.130> time<00:01:19.189> drawing

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
people have a really hard time drawing

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.459 
people have a really hard time drawing
because<00:01:19.789> the<00:01:20.420> frame<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> bike<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:21.289> know<00:01:21.409> you

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
because the frame of a bike you know you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.749 
because the frame of a bike you know you
don't<00:01:21.679> know<00:01:21.740> where<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:21.979> chains<00:01:22.219> attached<00:01:22.549> or

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
don't know where the chains attached or

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.840 
don't know where the chains attached or
where<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.939> frame<00:01:23.149> is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
where the frame is

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.120 
where the frame is
if<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:25.969> start<00:01:26.240> drawing<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.749> bike<00:01:29.530> already<00:01:30.530> just

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
if I start drawing a bike already just

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.440 
if I start drawing a bike already just
with<00:01:31.249> drawing<00:01:31.520> two<00:01:31.639> wheels<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.060> kind<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.240> picks

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
with drawing two wheels it kind of picks

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.669 
with drawing two wheels it kind of picks
up<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.719> I<00:01:32.749> might<00:01:33.049> be<00:01:33.139> drawing<00:01:33.319> a<00:01:33.469> bike<00:01:33.590> and

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
up that I might be drawing a bike and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.020 
up that I might be drawing a bike and
you<00:01:33.770> see<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.039> frame<00:01:34.219> already<00:01:34.399> appear<00:01:34.789> so<00:01:34.999> you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
you see the frame already appear so you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.449 
you see the frame already appear so you
know<00:01:35.299> already<00:01:35.929> like<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:36.679> should<00:01:37.189> be<00:01:37.280> drawing

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
know already like I should be drawing

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.300 
know already like I should be drawing
the<00:01:37.670> frame<00:01:37.850> like<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.979> one<00:01:40.100> thing<00:01:40.219> that's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
the frame like this and one thing that's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.679 
the frame like this and one thing that's
important<00:01:40.789> is<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.030> don't<00:01:41.179> want<00:01:41.270> people<00:01:41.600> to

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
important is we don't want people to

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.849 
important is we don't want people to
think<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.990> shadow<00:01:42.229> is<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.560> part<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
think the shadow is a part of the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.649 
think the shadow is a part of the
drawing<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.490> as<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.090> draw<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:44.539> always

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
drawing so as you draw you can always

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.940 
drawing so as you draw you can always
click<00:01:44.899> over<00:01:45.139> here<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.619> see<00:01:45.740> what<00:01:45.829> your

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
click over here and see what your

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.169 
click over here and see what your
drawing<00:01:46.189> looks<00:01:46.340> like<00:01:46.459> without<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.850> shadows

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
drawing looks like without the shadows

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.330 
drawing looks like without the shadows
and<00:01:47.389> as<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.929> draw<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.649> shadows<00:01:49.009> have<00:01:49.189> more

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and as I draw the shadows have more

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
and as I draw the shadows have more
contrast<00:01:49.850> where<00:01:50.090> my<00:01:50.209> mouse<00:01:50.389> cursor<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.990> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
contrast where my mouse cursor is and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.379 
contrast where my mouse cursor is and
have<00:01:51.380> less<00:01:51.560> contrast<00:01:51.950> away<00:01:52.279> so<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.639> way<00:01:52.789> you

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:53.389 
have less contrast away so that way you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:54.879 
have less contrast away so that way you
don't<00:01:53.569> see<00:01:53.779> the<00:01:53.899> shadows<00:01:54.200> as<00:01:54.319> much<00:01:54.529> as<00:01:54.709> when

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
don't see the shadows as much as when

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.280 
don't see the shadows as much as when
you<00:01:54.979> move<00:01:55.189> further<00:01:55.369> away

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
you move further away

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.830 
you move further away
so<00:01:58.040> why<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.220> lot<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.490> my<00:01:58.600> research<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.810> in

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
so why a lot of my research is in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.180 
so why a lot of my research is in
fundamental<00:02:00.380> areas<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.830> object

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
fundamental areas like object

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.370 
fundamental areas like object
recognition<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.690> really<00:02:03.230> great

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
recognition this is a really great

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.200 
recognition this is a really great
example<00:02:03.500> where<00:02:04.160> basic<00:02:04.550> research<00:02:04.880> can<00:02:05.180> really

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
example where basic research can really

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.930 
example where basic research can really
push<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.720> boundaries<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.470> think<00:02:06.820> lead<00:02:07.820> to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
push the boundaries and I think lead to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.780 
push the boundaries and I think lead to
some<00:02:08.060> great<00:02:08.090> applications
