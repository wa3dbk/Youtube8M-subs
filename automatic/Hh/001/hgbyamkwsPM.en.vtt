00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
that this car has closest to 37,000

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.089 
that this car has closest to 37,000
miles<00:00:18.470> on<00:00:18.770> it

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
miles on it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.830 
miles on it
and<00:00:19.189> it's<00:00:19.520> pretty<00:00:19.670> much<00:00:19.790> a<00:00:19.939> known<00:00:20.210> defect<00:00:20.720> that

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
and it's pretty much a known defect that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.170 
and it's pretty much a known defect that
the<00:00:21.710> brake<00:00:22.099> pads<00:00:22.340> that<00:00:22.550> they<00:00:22.640> use<00:00:22.820> on<00:00:23.000> these

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
the brake pads that they use on these

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.700 
the brake pads that they use on these
cause<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.480> lot<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.689> squealing<00:00:24.230> because<00:00:24.529> they're

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
cause a lot of squealing because they're

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.010 
cause a lot of squealing because they're
not<00:00:24.829> exactly<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.369> best<00:00:25.489> brake<00:00:25.820> pads<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:26.419> we're

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
not exactly the best brake pads so we're

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.929 
not exactly the best brake pads so we're
going<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.169> do<00:00:27.259> is<00:00:27.380> we're<00:00:27.500> going<00:00:27.590> to<00:00:27.649> remove

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
going to lay this portion back here

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
going to lay this portion back here

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
because the brake line right here is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.270 
because the brake line right here is
going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.870> pull<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.070> want

can<00:02:21.840> basically<00:02:21.989> push<00:02:22.440> them<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.280> then

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
can basically push them back in and then

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
can basically push them back in and then
we're<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> put<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> brake<00:02:25.440> pads<00:02:25.680> back

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
we're going to put the brake pads back

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
we're going to put the brake pads back
in<00:02:26.160> we're<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> grease<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.480> back

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
in we're going to grease the back

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.590 
in we're going to grease the back
portion<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.440> first<00:02:28.709> though<00:02:29.090> which<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
portion of it first though which is on

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.240 
portion of it first though which is on
the<00:02:30.720> back<00:02:30.900> you'll<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.890> take<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.130> look

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the back you'll see when you take a look

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
the back you'll see when you take a look
at<00:02:32.370> these<00:02:32.489> brake<00:02:32.700> pads<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.420> take<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> look

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
at these brake pads you can take a look

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.740 
at these brake pads you can take a look
at<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.230> new<00:02:34.890> brake<00:02:35.100> pad<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.600> how

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
at this new brake pad and you see how

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.120 
at this new brake pad and you see how
much<00:02:36.870> thicker<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.890> I'm<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.100> to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
much thicker it is and I'm going to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.580 
much thicker it is and I'm going to
compare<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.640> old<00:02:38.910> brake<00:02:39.239> pad<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
compare it to the old brake pad the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
compare it to the old brake pad the
Honda<00:02:40.890> brake<00:02:41.070> pad<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.549> some<00:02:41.670> reason<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.970> much

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
Honda brake pad for some reason a much

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.420 
Honda brake pad for some reason a much
shorter<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.380> notice<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.280> new

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
shorter but if you don't notice the new

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.180 
shorter but if you don't notice the new
ones<00:02:44.670> are<00:02:44.850> much<00:02:45.030> much<00:02:45.750> bigger<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.830> come<00:02:47.010> on

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
ones are much much bigger just come on

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
ones are much much bigger just come on
and<00:02:47.340> show<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.640> comparison<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.690> has<00:02:48.930> sped

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
and show you a comparison this has sped

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.110 
and show you a comparison this has sped
up<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> video<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.890> we're<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> move<00:02:50.910> on

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
up the video and we're going to move on

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.270 
up the video and we're going to move on
to<00:02:51.299> put<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> grease<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.380> back<00:02:52.560> of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to put on the grease on the back of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.770 
to put on the grease on the back of
these<00:02:53.610> shims

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.649 

you

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.240 

so<00:03:11.659> when<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.900> install<00:03:12.230> these<00:03:12.470> there's<00:03:13.040> going

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
so when you install these there's going

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.039 
so when you install these there's going
to<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.370> two<00:03:13.549> parts<00:03:13.879> putting<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.629> brake<00:03:14.810> pads

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
to be two parts putting the brake pads

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.300 
to be two parts putting the brake pads
back<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.620> make<00:03:15.709> sure<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.040> shims

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
back in and make sure the shims

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.039 
back in and make sure the shims
originally<00:03:16.819> they're<00:03:17.000> mine<00:03:17.330> did<00:03:17.540> not<00:03:17.690> come<00:03:17.900> off

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
originally they're mine did not come off

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.050 
originally they're mine did not come off
so<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.290> do<00:03:18.379> not<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.769> reinstall<00:03:19.159> them<00:03:19.370> so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
so I do not have to reinstall them so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
so I do not have to reinstall them so
we're<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.330> put<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.629> in<00:03:20.900> using<00:03:21.440> this

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
we're going to put this in using this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.860 
we're going to put this in using this
with<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> guides<00:03:22.099> see<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.120> these<00:03:23.299> using<00:03:23.780> as

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
with the guides see with these using as

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.390 
with the guides see with these using as
the<00:03:23.989> guides<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.620> outside<00:03:25.099> they're<00:03:25.280> going

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the guides on the outside they're going

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
the guides on the outside they're going
to<00:03:25.459> fit<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.930> top<00:03:27.170> port<00:03:27.470> right<00:03:27.620> here<00:03:27.860> so

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
to fit in this top port right here so

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.550 
to fit in this top port right here so
pretty<00:03:28.340> much<00:03:28.519> they<00:03:28.730> slide<00:03:29.000> back<00:03:29.239> in<00:03:29.450> like<00:03:30.319> that

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
pretty much they slide back in like that

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.640 
pretty much they slide back in like that
and<00:03:30.890> then<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.659> other<00:03:32.690> side<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:33.319> will<00:03:33.349> do

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
and then on the other side we will do

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.940 
and then on the other side we will do
the<00:03:33.769> same<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.560> first<00:03:36.739> time

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the same and this is the first time

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.309 
the same and this is the first time
you've<00:03:37.129> done<00:03:37.159> this<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.819> not<00:03:38.150> too<00:03:38.390> bad<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.140> a

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
you've done this is it not too bad of a

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.110 
you've done this is it not too bad of a
job<00:03:39.349> it's<00:03:39.739> pretty<00:03:39.920> easy<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.250> do<00:03:43.120> basically

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
job it's pretty easy to do basically

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.380 
job it's pretty easy to do basically
what<00:03:44.269> we're<00:03:44.390> going<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.569> do<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:44.959> we're<00:03:45.140> going<00:03:45.260> to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:58.360 
what we're going to do is we're going to
put<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.540> other<00:03:47.810> side<00:03:48.109> back<00:03:48.349> in<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.890> remember

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
put this other side back in and remember

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.460 
put this other side back in and remember
just<00:03:58.400> as<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> guide<00:03:59.030> you're<00:03:59.989> going<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.260> using

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
just as a guide you're going to be using

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.860 
just as a guide you're going to be using
these<00:04:01.190> as<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.459> guide<00:04:01.730> right<00:04:02.000> here<00:04:02.329> so<00:04:02.540> these<00:04:02.690> go

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
these as a guide right here so these go

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.710 
these as a guide right here so these go
on<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:04.010> top<00:04:04.250> portion<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.420> traverse

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
on the top portion so you can traverse

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.660 
on the top portion so you can traverse
underneath<00:04:06.319> like<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:06.769> but<00:04:06.950> also<00:04:07.069> this<00:04:07.459> notch

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
underneath like that but also this notch

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.300 
underneath like that but also this notch
right<00:04:07.879> here<00:04:07.940> is<00:04:08.239> on<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.480> bottom<00:04:08.780> portion<00:04:09.310> what

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
right here is on the bottom portion what

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.370 
right here is on the bottom portion what
we're<00:04:10.400> going<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.549> do<00:04:10.700> next<00:04:10.879> is<00:04:11.090> we're<00:04:11.269> going<00:04:11.420> to

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.979 

so<00:04:15.380> within<00:04:15.590> here<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.780> brake<00:04:17.959> fluid

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
so within here this is the brake fluid

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.140 
so within here this is the brake fluid
cap<00:04:18.530> we<00:04:18.769> usually<00:04:19.130> remove<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.639> whenever<00:04:19.910> we're

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
cap we usually remove it whenever we're

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.100 
cap we usually remove it whenever we're
going<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.599> pull<00:04:21.560> out<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:24.130> push<00:04:25.130> in<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.430> brake

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
going to pull out the push in the brake

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.930 
going to pull out the push in the brake
piston<00:04:27.110> back<00:04:27.260> in<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:27.979> your<00:04:28.490> whole<00:04:28.669> system

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
piston back in so that your whole system

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.839 
piston back in so that your whole system
consists<00:04:29.599> of<00:04:29.630> brake<00:04:29.930> fluid<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.849> brake

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
consists of brake fluid and brake

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.600 
consists of brake fluid and brake
booster<00:04:32.090> that<00:04:32.539> will<00:04:32.740> push<00:04:33.740> your<00:04:33.919> brakes<00:04:34.160> in<00:04:34.400> so

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
booster that will push your brakes in so

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.500 
booster that will push your brakes in so
that's<00:04:34.700> what<00:04:34.910> happens<00:04:35.180> when<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.389> engage

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
that's what happens when you engage

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.180 
that's what happens when you engage
we're<00:04:36.200> just<00:04:36.320> going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> open<00:04:36.530> up<00:04:36.770> this<00:04:36.919> cap

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
we're just going to open up this cap

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.310 
we're just going to open up this cap
right<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.430> you'll<00:04:38.360> notice<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.870> you'll<00:04:39.050> see

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
right here you'll notice it you'll see

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.960 
right here you'll notice it you'll see
it<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.590> it'll<00:04:39.680> basically<00:04:40.160> say<00:04:40.340> brake<00:04:40.610> fluid

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
it and it'll basically say brake fluid

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.640 
it and it'll basically say brake fluid
so<00:04:41.150> we're<00:04:41.330> going<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:41.479> open<00:04:41.630> it<00:04:41.840> up<00:04:41.960> so<00:04:42.169> that

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
so we're going to open it up so that

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.730 
so we're going to open it up so that
when<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:42.889> push<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.210> piston<00:04:44.389> back<00:04:44.720> in<00:04:44.960> then<00:04:45.349> it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
when we push the piston back in then it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.980 
when we push the piston back in then it
will<00:04:46.340> remember<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.150> are<00:04:47.330> putting<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:47.750> back

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
will remember you are putting this back

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.930 
will remember you are putting this back
I<00:04:48.470> sped<00:04:49.070> up<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.280> video<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.639> little<00:04:49.820> bit

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
I sped up this video a little bit

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.490 
I sped up this video a little bit
because<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.330> takes<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.599> while<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:51.410> can

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
because it takes a while you can

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.560 
because it takes a while you can
basically<00:04:51.710> take<00:04:51.889> a<00:04:52.039> break<00:04:52.550> change<00:04:53.060> kit<00:04:53.389> and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
basically take a break change kit and

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.120 
basically take a break change kit and
push<00:04:53.780> back<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.110> piston<00:04:54.530> which<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.830> what<00:04:54.979> we've

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
push back the piston which is what we've

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.010 
push back the piston which is what we've
done<00:04:55.160> back<00:04:55.550> here<00:04:55.910> then<00:04:56.630> we're<00:04:56.720> putting<00:04:56.960> this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
done back here then we're putting this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.110 
done back here then we're putting this
back<00:04:57.199> we're<00:04:57.530> putting<00:04:57.800> in<00:04:57.949> the<00:04:58.130> calipers<00:04:58.820> so

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
back we're putting in the calipers so

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.909 
back we're putting in the calipers so
we're<00:04:59.240> putting<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.570> top<00:05:00.080> caliper<00:05:00.470> in<00:05:00.620> first

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
we're putting the top caliper in first

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.300 
we're putting the top caliper in first
and<00:05:01.190> then<00:05:01.490> putting<00:05:01.820> in<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.090> bottom<00:05:02.510> caliper

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
and then putting in the bottom caliper

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.620 
and then putting in the bottom caliper
top<00:05:04.310> portion<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:04.789> basically<00:05:05.150> there<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.479> hold

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
top portion is basically there to hold

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.760 
top portion is basically there to hold
it<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:05.930> we're<00:05:06.020> going<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.199> basically<00:05:06.410> put<00:05:06.650> it

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
it and we're going to basically put it

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.900 
it and we're going to basically put it
in<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.160> same<00:05:07.520> order<00:05:08.229> backwards<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.560> then

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
in the same order backwards and then

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.450 
in the same order backwards and then
make<00:05:10.910> sure<00:05:10.940> you<00:05:11.270> turn<00:05:12.050> it<00:05:12.260> both<00:05:13.039> top<00:05:13.280> and

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
make sure you turn it both top and

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.010 
make sure you turn it both top and
bottom<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:13.880> do<00:05:13.970> about<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.210> quarter<00:05:14.570> turn<00:05:14.810> and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
bottom and do about a quarter turn and

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.950 
bottom and do about a quarter turn and
then<00:05:15.680> once<00:05:16.310> you're<00:05:16.520> finished<00:05:16.639> up<00:05:16.970> put<00:05:17.810> your

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
then once you're finished up put your

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.540 
then once you're finished up put your
tire<00:05:18.139> back<00:05:18.349> on<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.830> there<00:05:19.159> you<00:05:19.280> go

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
tire back on and there you go

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.820 
tire back on and there you go
you're<00:05:19.700> done
