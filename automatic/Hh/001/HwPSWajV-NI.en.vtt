you get out of the package just rotate
that<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:21.390> tube<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.200> way<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
that little tube up that way so that it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.249 
that little tube up that way so that it
is<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:25.919> angle<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.489> down<00:00:26.849> tube

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
is that a right angle to the down tube

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.720 
is that a right angle to the down tube
this<00:00:28.259> is<00:00:28.320> where<00:00:28.619> your<00:00:28.739> mouth<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.640> be

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this is where your mouth is going to be

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
this is where your mouth is going to be
and<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.290> the<00:00:31.590> tube<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> go

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and this is the tube that is going to go

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.510 
and this is the tube that is going to go
into<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.450> liquid<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
into the liquid what you do is you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.080 
into the liquid what you do is you
simply<00:00:35.730> blow<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.719> end<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:38.309> will

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
simply blow in this end and it will

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
simply blow in this end and it will
create<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> pressure<00:00:39.750> system<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:41.190> we'll

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
create a pressure system here then we'll

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
create a pressure system here then we'll
draw<00:00:41.609> the<00:00:41.690> fluid<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:43.109> through<00:00:43.589> the<00:00:43.679> tube<00:00:43.859> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
draw the fluid up through the tube and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.520 
draw the fluid up through the tube and
anybody<00:00:44.999> who's<00:00:45.300> familiar<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.839> carburetors

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
anybody who's familiar with carburetors

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.919 
anybody who's familiar with carburetors
will<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.089> venturi

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
will know that that is the venturi

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.049 
will know that that is the venturi
effect<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.280> bit<00:00:50.429> of<00:00:50.519> physics<00:00:50.909> there

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
effect so a little bit of physics there

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
effect so a little bit of physics there
for<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> folks<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.719> there

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.400 

hold<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.280> downtube<00:00:57.760> when<00:00:58.750> inserting<00:00:59.200> it<00:00:59.290> into

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
hold the downtube when inserting it into

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.960 
hold the downtube when inserting it into
the<00:00:59.590> ink<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.010> then<00:01:00.100> just<00:01:00.400> leaving<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the ink and then just leaving the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.030 
the ink and then just leaving the
mouthpiece<00:01:01.480> part<00:01:01.810> sort<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.320> open<00:01:02.890> like<00:01:03.010> that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
mouthpiece part sort of open like that

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.770 
mouthpiece part sort of open like that
don't<00:01:03.280> grab<00:01:03.520> onto<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:03.850> you'll<00:01:04.330> be<00:01:04.479> grabbing

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
don't grab onto that you'll be grabbing

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.930 
don't grab onto that you'll be grabbing
that<00:01:04.870> with<00:01:05.050> your<00:01:05.199> mouth<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.830> then<00:01:06.550> what<00:01:06.850> you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
that with your mouth and then what you

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.430 
that with your mouth and then what you
want<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.090> do<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.330> make<00:01:07.900> sure<00:01:07.930> you've<00:01:08.200> got<00:01:08.229> a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
want to do is make sure you've got a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.550 
want to do is make sure you've got a
good<00:01:09.280> bit<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.000> air<00:01:10.510> in<00:01:10.900> your<00:01:11.020> lungs<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.350> take<00:01:11.530> a

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
good bit of air in your lungs to take a

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.800 
good bit of air in your lungs to take a
deep<00:01:11.770> breath<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.600> take<00:01:13.780> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
deep breath and it's going to take a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.490 
deep breath and it's going to take a
little<00:01:13.960> bit<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.200> practice<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:16.140> control<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
little bit of practice to control the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.219 
little bit of practice to control the
spray<00:01:17.890> but<00:01:18.880> again<00:01:19.119> it's<00:01:19.960> pretty

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
spray but again it's pretty

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.550 
spray but again it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.400> use<00:01:21.610> acrylics

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
straightforward and you can use acrylics

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640 
straightforward and you can use acrylics
watercolour<00:01:23.560> gouache<00:01:24.300> ink<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.350> you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
watercolour gouache ink and then you

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.770 
watercolour gouache ink and then you
probably<00:01:26.920> want<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.100> thin<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.729> acrylics<00:01:28.600> or

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
probably want to thin the acrylics or

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.270 
probably want to thin the acrylics or
gouache<00:01:29.050> down<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> little<00:01:29.560> bit<00:01:29.770> just<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.190> make

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
gouache down a little bit just to make

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.350 
gouache down a little bit just to make
it<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.840> sprayable<00:01:31.840> consistency<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:33.300> with<00:01:34.300> a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
it a sprayable consistency and with a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480 
it a sprayable consistency and with a
little<00:01:34.570> bit<00:01:34.660> of<00:01:34.720> practice<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:35.800> can<00:01:36.070> use<00:01:36.310> it

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
little bit of practice you can use it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.670 
little bit of practice you can use it
for<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.880> layering<00:01:37.390> effect<00:01:37.810> on<00:01:38.410> other<00:01:38.619> things

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
for a layering effect on other things

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.050 
for a layering effect on other things
but<00:01:39.490> here<00:01:40.300> we<00:01:40.390> go<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:40.690> we<00:01:40.780> take<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> deep<00:01:41.140> breath

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
but here we go so we take a deep breath

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.880 
but here we go so we take a deep breath
and<00:01:43.060> blow<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.810> can<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.410> makes<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.740> bit

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
and blow and you can see it makes a bit

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.469 
and blow and you can see it makes a bit
of<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.039> mess<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.460> want<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.789> protect<00:01:52.149> any

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
of a mess so you want to protect any

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.469 
of a mess so you want to protect any
area<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:53.590> don't<00:01:54.100> want<00:01:54.310> paint<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.030> and

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
area that you don't want paint on and

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.660 
area that you don't want paint on and
you<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.320> go<00:01:56.410> up<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.740> down<00:01:56.920> or<00:01:57.250> left<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.640> right

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
you can go up and down or left to right

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.710 
you can go up and down or left to right
and<00:01:58.030> by<00:01:58.390> varying<00:01:58.899> your<00:01:59.729> breath<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.300> vary

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
and by varying your breath you can vary

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.350 
and by varying your breath you can vary
the<00:02:02.170> amount<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.740> vapor<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.090> you're<00:02:04.240> making

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the amount of vapor that you're making

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.969 
the amount of vapor that you're making
or<00:02:04.569> paint<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.020> you're<00:02:05.140> spraying<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.649> to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
or paint that you're spraying on to

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:17.229 
or paint that you're spraying on to
whatever<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.819> sprite

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.009 

and<00:02:18.739> never<00:02:19.739> ever<00:02:20.010> ever<00:02:20.450> inhale<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.900> have

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
and never ever ever inhale when you have
