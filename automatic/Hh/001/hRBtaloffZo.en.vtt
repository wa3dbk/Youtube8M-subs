00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
hey guys what's up Steve here and this

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.359 
hey guys what's up Steve here and this
is<00:00:08.450> another<00:00:08.750> hobby<00:00:09.230> room<00:00:09.590> idea<00:00:10.490> and<00:00:10.820> tip<00:00:12.580> so

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
is another hobby room idea and tip so

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.149 
is another hobby room idea and tip so
yeah<00:00:16.369> eventually<00:00:17.180> if<00:00:18.050> you<00:00:18.800> have<00:00:18.890> a<00:00:18.920> lot<00:00:19.130> of

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:19.159 
yeah eventually if you have a lot of

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.239 
yeah eventually if you have a lot of
paints<00:00:19.550> you'll<00:00:19.699> reach<00:00:19.849> a<00:00:19.999> point<00:00:20.179> where<00:00:21.249> it

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:22.249 
paints you'll reach a point where it

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.419 
paints you'll reach a point where it
becomes<00:00:22.789> difficult<00:00:23.179> to<00:00:23.980> organize<00:00:24.980> it<00:00:25.220> in<00:00:25.310> a

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
becomes difficult to organize it in a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.989 
becomes difficult to organize it in a
easy-to-use<00:00:26.199> way<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:28.699> I<00:00:28.730> kind<00:00:29.179> of<00:00:29.239> thought<00:00:29.419> of

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
easy-to-use way so I kind of thought of

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.610 
easy-to-use way so I kind of thought of
making<00:00:31.999> a<00:00:32.450> shelf<00:00:33.020> for<00:00:33.760> all<00:00:34.760> my<00:00:35.359> paints<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:36.469> was

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
making a shelf for all my paints it was

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.080 
making a shelf for all my paints it was
really<00:00:36.890> simple<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:37.370> cost<00:00:37.579> 20<00:00:38.390> bucks<00:00:39.969> and<00:00:40.969> if

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
really simple it cost 20 bucks and if

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.000 
really simple it cost 20 bucks and if
you<00:00:41.179> have<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.329> table<00:00:41.570> saw<00:00:41.929> you<00:00:41.989> can<00:00:42.350> cut<00:00:42.859> these

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
you have a table saw you can cut these

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.110 
you have a table saw you can cut these
pieces<00:00:43.250> for<00:00:43.789> cheaper<00:00:45.429> but<00:00:46.429> I<00:00:46.640> went<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
pieces for cheaper but I went to the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.689 
pieces for cheaper but I went to the
hardware<00:00:47.239> store<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.960> bought<00:00:48.379> these<00:00:48.620> on

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
hardware store and bought these on

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.150 
hardware store and bought these on
pre-cut<00:00:49.960> pieces<00:00:50.960> like<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.559> smallest<00:00:51.859> are

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
pre-cut pieces like the smallest are

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.989 
pre-cut pieces like the smallest are
like<00:00:53.230> about<00:00:54.230> an<00:00:54.379> inch<00:00:54.530> half<00:00:55.339> inch<00:00:55.519> this<00:00:55.789> way

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999

like about an inch half inch this way
maybe<00:00:56.719> an<00:00:56.899> inch<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.230> half<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.980> way<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.899> I

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
maybe an inch and a half this way and I

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.290 
maybe an inch and a half this way and I
got<00:01:00.079> four<00:01:00.739> actually<00:01:01.339> I<00:01:01.370> didn't<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.820> four<00:01:02.149> but

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
got four actually I didn't get four but

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.020 
got four actually I didn't get four but
I<00:01:02.329> should<00:01:02.480> have<00:01:02.600> gotten<00:01:02.780> four<00:01:03.610> eight<00:01:04.610> foot

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
I should have gotten four eight foot

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.810 
I should have gotten four eight foot
long<00:01:05.269> pieces<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.380> cut<00:01:06.530> them<00:01:06.650> in<00:01:06.800> half<00:01:07.640> and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
long pieces just cut them in half and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
long pieces just cut them in half and
then<00:01:07.910> cut<00:01:08.000> one<00:01:08.330> piece<00:01:08.510> in<00:01:08.840> half<00:01:09.050> again<00:01:09.380> for<00:01:10.040> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
then cut one piece in half again for the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.560 
then cut one piece in half again for the
sides<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:12.350> there<00:01:12.620> were<00:01:12.710> also<00:01:12.920> these<00:01:13.570> pegboard

pegboard pieces they're pre-cut at two

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.500 
pegboard pieces they're pre-cut at two
feet<00:01:19.550> by<00:01:19.760> four<00:01:20.030> feet<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:22.640> cut<00:01:23.270> all<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
feet by four feet so I just cut all the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.080 
feet by four feet so I just cut all the
pieces<00:01:23.690> took<00:01:24.500> five<00:01:24.860> minutes<00:01:25.010> and<00:01:25.460> then<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.730> just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
organizing thing so I've kind of emptied

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.490 
organizing thing so I've kind of emptied
that<00:02:13.820> out<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.600> put<00:02:14.780> everything<00:02:15.020> onto

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500

the<00:02:16.100> wall<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.720> I've<00:02:18.350> just<00:02:18.470> kind<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.770> organized

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the wall and I've just kind of organized

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.840 
the wall and I've just kind of organized
it<00:02:19.520> by<00:02:19.640> color<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:21.050> need<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:22.100> through<00:02:22.550> and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
it by color I need to go through and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.620 
it by color I need to go through and
sort<00:02:23.420> out<00:02:23.600> which<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.610> model<00:02:25.910> masters<00:02:26.300> are

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
sort out which of the model masters are

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.770 
sort out which of the model masters are
gloss<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.440> which<00:02:27.590> are<00:02:27.800> flat<00:02:28.600> it's<00:02:29.600> pretty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
gloss and which are flat it's pretty

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.500 
gloss and which are flat it's pretty
easy<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.110> tell<00:02:30.790> looking<00:02:31.790> at<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.970> tops<00:02:32.210> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
easy to tell looking at the tops and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.880 
easy to tell looking at the tops and
stuff<00:02:32.720> but<00:02:33.160> all<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.280> glosses<00:02:34.790> are<00:02:34.820> up<00:02:34.970> top<00:02:35.210> and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
stuff but all the glosses are up top and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.180 
stuff but all the glosses are up top and
sorted<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.130> these<00:02:37.490> by<00:02:37.700> color<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:42.190> hopefully

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
sorted all these by color so hopefully

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070 
sorted all these by color so hopefully
this<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.490> helpful<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:44.030> if<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.720> space

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
this was helpful and if you have space
