00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 how about a very good night we started the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.750
 working week talking about the tropics 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 remember we are climbing is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.980
 pending regarding the season of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.049
 hurricanes the peak of the season is the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.240
 Sept. 11 at least to the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 area of ​​the pacific the situation has 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 been a little more active we call or by 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 the tropical storm 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 hernán if we already go for the h continue 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.539
 weakening as it goes 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 entering on slightly cooler waters 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.019
 now about the Atlantic remember no 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 we have had a lot of activity but if 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.870
 there is a disturbance that is maintained 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.390
 to almost 4,000 miles to our east 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 southeast but we must watch it from very 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 close still enough 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 disorganized but has 50% of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.070
 probability that it will move to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 as it moves towards the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 west-northwest ratio of 15 miles per 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 hour has 50 percent of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.059
 probability of development during the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 next two days so it will continue 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 monitoring this situation for now nothing 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.090
 to worry about the tropic 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.800
 here in houston but that we should 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.739
 worry about that heat still we 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.010
 temperatures are quite hot 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.020
 two days with temperatures above 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.870
 95 degrees and at this time of night it 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 they feel as if they were at 94 degrees 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.240
 at the intercontinental airport though 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.680
 marks mercury 87 degrees so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 we must be very aware of this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.690
 Situation stay hydrated and also 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.510
 do not forget to use that sunscreen 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.850
 although we see a little cloud of hair 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.650
 solar ultraviolet radiation continues 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.290
 quite elevated notice that the downpours 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.640
 all this associated have dissipated 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.380
 also with the diurnal heating but 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 also due to a front band that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 will be hanging around our region 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 this front band extends from 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.850
 this low pressure system that by 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.830
 certain work conditions pretty 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.080
 active towards the new area 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.780
 england boston or near boston in 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.170
 the city of riviera touched down a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 tornado that was classified in f2 this 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 means with maximum winds of 120 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.770
 miles per hour had a width of almost 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.840
 half a mile and traveled two miles here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.880
 we see the damage it caused but 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 fortunately, he did not leave injured or 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 neither dead are these very good 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.130
 news but do not see that the system 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 low pressure has already been removed from this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.760
 zone the situation stays is a little bit 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.739
 these downpours will continue 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 weakening as they go 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.340
 moving east towards our 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.140
 region the downpours will be a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.329
 little bit more active for tomorrow we are going to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.219
 have some storms in particular to 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.170
 from midday pending to this 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.670
 these are going to be activated 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.859
 only by the diurnal heating 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.230
 but what is going to support that these are 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.909
 generate is going to be this frontal band that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.859
 is going to look good close to our 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.079
 region for tomorrow tuesday but notice that 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.930
 for Wednesday the band still 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.790
 frontal stays close by that there is a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.409
 risk of having some rains me 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.659
 it seems that the biggest coverage is going to be 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.340
 for tomorrow after noon but already 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.159
 for Wednesday we are left with 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.079
 some showers isolated the sky a 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.790
 little more cloudy than we have 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.349
 had during the last two days the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.540
 Thursday comes a low pressure system 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.340
 who is going to be leaving us on a Friday 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.739
 pretty cloudy but I do not have in the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.169
 cloudiness we will not have much sun 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.790
 obviously so the temperatures will 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.159
 are going to be bordering the low range of 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.349
 the 90 degrees and the weekend by 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.660
 now it tastes typical summery with some 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.430
 showers apart 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 I wish you an excellent lunch 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.580
 night
