hey this is metal Mike and in this in
this<00:00:20.259> lesson<00:00:20.710> we're<00:00:20.830> going<00:00:21.009> to<00:00:21.160> talk<00:00:21.460> about<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
this lesson we're going to talk about a

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.310 
this lesson we're going to talk about a
question<00:00:23.680> or<00:00:24.310> concern<00:00:25.300> that<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.840> lot<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.080> my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
question or concern that a lot of my

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.130 
question or concern that a lot of my
students<00:00:26.740> were<00:00:27.609> asking<00:00:28.090> me<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.300> lot<00:00:28.390> and<00:00:28.960> that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
students were asking me a lot and that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.360 
students were asking me a lot and that
was<00:00:29.670> basically<00:00:30.670> the<00:00:30.820> idea<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:32.250> breaking<00:00:33.250> away

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
was basically the idea of breaking away

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.630 
was basically the idea of breaking away
from<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.210> constant<00:00:34.800> route<00:00:35.800> fifth<00:00:36.250> power

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
from the constant route fifth power

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.020 
from the constant route fifth power
chord<00:00:37.320> rhythms<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.190> know<00:00:39.309> dananana

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
chord rhythms of that you know dananana

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.119 
chord rhythms of that you know dananana
dananana<00:00:40.059> dananana<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:41.589> know<00:00:41.739> they<00:00:41.949> did

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
dananana dananana you know they did

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.190 
dananana dananana you know they did
people<00:00:42.460> I<00:00:42.760> think<00:00:42.820> people<00:00:43.269> starting<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.780> hear

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
people I think people starting to hear

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.729 
people I think people starting to hear
different<00:00:45.160> note<00:00:45.610> groupings<00:00:46.530> chords<00:00:47.530> that

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
different note groupings chords that

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.279 
different note groupings chords that
that<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.640> work<00:00:48.969> really<00:00:49.270> well<00:00:49.480> in<00:00:49.930> metal

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
that that that work really well in metal

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.069 
that that that work really well in metal
bar<00:00:50.500> not<00:00:50.879> always<00:00:51.879> your<00:00:52.059> power<00:00:52.329> chords<00:00:52.930> and

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
bar not always your power chords and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.319 
bar not always your power chords and
I've<00:00:53.170> had<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.379> lot<00:00:53.559> of<00:00:53.590> questions<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.399> where<00:00:55.149> do

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
I've had a lot of questions of where do

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.319 
I've had a lot of questions of where do
I<00:00:55.390> find<00:00:55.780> these<00:00:55.960> chords<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.789> are<00:00:58.059> these

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
I find these chords and what are these

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.090 
I find these chords and what are these
chords<00:00:58.899> and<00:00:59.050> how<00:00:59.170> do<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.410> get<00:00:59.530> that<00:00:59.800> little

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
chords and how do I get that little

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.310 
chords and how do I get that little
different<00:01:00.460> sound<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:01.809> we're<00:01:01.960> gonna<00:01:02.110> go

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
different sound so so we're gonna go

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.609 
different sound so so we're gonna go
through<00:01:02.559> some<00:01:02.670> ideas<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.879> tricks<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.619> find

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
through some ideas and tricks to find

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.760 
through some ideas and tricks to find
them<00:01:05.830> on<00:01:05.950> your<00:01:06.100> guitar<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.960> thought<00:01:08.320> about

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
them on your guitar what I thought about

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.680 
them on your guitar what I thought about
about<00:01:09.310> doing<00:01:09.700> basically<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.330> get<00:01:10.479> these

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
about doing basically to get these

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.279 
about doing basically to get these
chords<00:01:11.590> together<00:01:12.190> is<00:01:12.700> let<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.660> found<00:01:13.960> out<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
chords together is let I found out the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.350 
chords together is let I found out the
fingering<00:01:14.770> for<00:01:14.950> one<00:01:15.130> octave<00:01:15.459> scale<00:01:15.759> in<00:01:16.179> this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
fingering for one octave scale in this

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.669 
fingering for one octave scale in this
case<00:01:16.420> an<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.319> minor<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:20.470> found<00:01:21.209> any

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
case an a minor and I found any

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.919 
case an a minor and I found any
different<00:01:23.679> any<00:01:24.160> shape<00:01:24.819> that<00:01:25.119> had<00:01:25.270> two<00:01:25.630> notes

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
different any shape that had two notes

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:26.699 
different any shape that had two notes
in<00:01:26.259> it

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
in it

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.449 
in it
that<00:01:27.280> sounded<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.849> chord<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.810> me<00:01:28.959> and<00:01:29.190> as<00:01:30.190> I

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
that sounded like a chord to me and as I

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.790 
that sounded like a chord to me and as I
went<00:01:31.119> back<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.539> theory<00:01:31.959> to<00:01:32.080> work<00:01:32.110> or<00:01:32.619> it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
went back to theory to work or it's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.309 
went back to theory to work or it's
indeed<00:01:33.209> so<00:01:34.209> the<00:01:34.390> first<00:01:34.630> chord<00:01:35.020> you're<00:01:35.200> gonna

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
indeed so the first chord you're gonna

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.169 
indeed so the first chord you're gonna
have<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.679> right<00:01:35.860> right<00:01:36.310> here<00:01:36.490> obviously<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> a

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
have is right right here obviously the a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.200 
have is right right here obviously the a
power<00:01:37.509> chord

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.780 

then<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> had<00:01:41.049> another<00:01:41.200> grouping<00:01:41.860> with<00:01:42.610> this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
then I had another grouping with this

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.200 
then I had another grouping with this
note

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.570 

add<00:01:47.930> another<00:01:48.230> grouping<00:01:48.740> based<00:01:49.310> off<00:01:49.550> of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
add another grouping based off of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.340 
add another grouping based off of
actually<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.060> route<00:01:50.330> again<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:54.170> have

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually the route again and I have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.490 
actually the route again and I have
another<00:01:54.620> one<00:01:54.860> from<00:01:55.100> here

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.200 

so<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> four<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:01.380> note<00:02:01.940> patterns<00:02:02.940> would

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so just the four to note patterns would

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.590 
so just the four to note patterns would
be<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:04.050> no<00:02:04.380> particular<00:02:04.560> order

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.910 

okay<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.140> check<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.470> out<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.680> have

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
okay and then check this out I have

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
okay and then check this out I have
another<00:02:14.190> cool<00:02:14.520> autumnal<00:02:15.390> grouping<00:02:16.050> which

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
another cool autumnal grouping which

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.620 
another cool autumnal grouping which
would<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.680> fourth<00:02:17.130> type<00:02:17.550> chord<00:02:18.000> based

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
would be like a fourth type chord based

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:29.800 
would be like a fourth type chord based
off<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.320> B<00:02:19.500> note<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.700> E

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.380 

hey<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:30.870> here's<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.409> little<00:02:32.129> rhythm<00:02:32.430> idea<00:02:32.909> that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
hey so here's a little rhythm idea that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.569 
hey so here's a little rhythm idea that
incorporates<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> two<00:02:34.409> no<00:02:34.560> cords<00:02:35.040> were<00:02:35.310> found

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
incorporates the two no cords were found

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:53.839 
incorporates the two no cords were found
within<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> scale

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.390 

okay<00:02:54.849> so<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.450> rhythm<00:02:55.900> part<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:56.950> pretty

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
okay so this rhythm part this is pretty

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.430 
okay so this rhythm part this is pretty
simple<00:02:57.760> but<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:58.360> there<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> lot<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.170> cool

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
simple but it but there is a lot of cool

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.089 
simple but it but there is a lot of cool
little<00:02:59.650> things<00:03:00.040> happening<00:03:00.610> within<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:02.099> you

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
little things happening within it you

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.960 
little things happening within it you
know<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.370> starts<00:03:03.700> off<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.810> first<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.290> chord

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
know it starts off of the first a chord

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.110 
know it starts off of the first a chord
but<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.269> first<00:03:07.540> melody<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.489> have<00:03:12.910> this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
but the first melody see it have this

those<00:03:19.750> three<00:03:20.080> chords<00:03:20.349> could<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.830> chords<00:03:21.160> up

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.330 
those three chords could be chords up
just<00:03:22.150> upon<00:03:22.480> themselves<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:24.129> that's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
just upon themselves and that that's

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.339 
just upon themselves and that that's
bouncing<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.540> bouncing<00:03:25.989> off<00:03:26.110> of

the<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.769> pedal<00:03:27.220> tone<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.330> sort<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.780> gives

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
the a pedal tone and that sort of gives

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.960 
the a pedal tone and that sort of gives
you<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.290> little<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.739> melodic<00:03:30.069> movement<00:03:30.790> in

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
it which a lot of these chords will tend

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.410 
it which a lot of these chords will tend
them<00:03:33.069> itself<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.750> sound<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> deuce
