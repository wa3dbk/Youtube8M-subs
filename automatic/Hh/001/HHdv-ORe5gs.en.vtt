00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.440
 I knew you do not dare to close it ryan 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.750
 I swear I did not go and neither did 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.340
 violet please told me everything he told me that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.230
 a radio was found right in the room 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.360
 where they locked her she walked and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 I hear they asked for help and that 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.320
 check that I'm at fault 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.390
 scratches there are millions and millions of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.309
 handies all over the world 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 you may be right but if you are so 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.419
 safe because we do not carry this radio to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.390
 study and we compare it with the other 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.450
 violet here walk a second I have to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.810
 speak privately 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.329
 I have to confess something 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.390
 and whose they said it was you 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 you have no recorded limits 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 strange and violet did not enter the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 I 'm taking you for jokes and you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.130
 Free path is what I did 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.810
 he did as a player if tomás is the one who does not 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.940
 enter the studio it would be the same do not you think 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.530
 not because we will live to be podés 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.040
 out of the studio 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 so you keep an appointment 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.570
 also the dream of violet is to enter 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.570
 study 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.780
 when I give you feelings 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.550
 ok to have respect I just tell you 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 one thing I'm going to separate them and I'm not going to 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.280
 stop until you get it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.159
 ok I can not be distracted always and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.840
 when you do not mess with violet ok 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.840
 is that we are the couples that snow 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.640
 thank you friends for leaving me to blame 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.490
 this time you had it if you had thrown 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.060
 this in time is obvious way against 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.030
 girl the next of this a donation 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.690
 I do not know 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.690
 good 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.429
 violet why did you leave if you're 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.429
 angry about something 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.420
 because it 's downhill 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.799
 because you should be celebrating that you have 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.000
 focused the study m of being 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.020
 worried because everyone is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.970
 consulting 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.040
 because 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.510
 see if they did not approve me after something 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.510
 better this is not for me 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.610
 do not say this anymore music is your passion 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.980
 and you do not have to give up the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.300
 new member to the study well 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.410
 Congratulations 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.410
 I knew I would be fine 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.630
 while it hurts you that some do not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.630
 they could enter 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.990
 with good interruptions it seems that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.550
 I have an apology there was an error in the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.420
 román note form your note 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.020

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.020
 welcome from the study 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.519

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.519
 terms would be organized school 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.920
 until he wants 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.050
 who says he's going to be my father 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 it's my first day in the studio and I do not 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.280
 I want to have enemies 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 Well, it seems like a good decision and I 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 I'm scared to death if you're afraid 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.040
 look means shots do not lose this 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.900
 time because I have nothing to do 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.000
 with him if not my life I'm not 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.819

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.420
 to say to you 2000 a just do not talk like that 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.980
 and I did not want anything we were not talking 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.750
 I was just explaining how 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.519
 are the things in this place now that 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.620
 let's go to your defense attorney for someone 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.690
 You can tell why it's stuck 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.250
 the names are ready 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.560

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.270
 love passion feelings of that 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:37.800
 they treat the two challenges two duos duos 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.690
 forget it forget it the important thing is that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.700
 both are mixed so we're just going to 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.280
 draw for abandoned men not 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.990
 they must be perfect then the first 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:56.700
 couple is the couple of camila and will be 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:59.000
 Andrey and better known the following 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.000
 partner 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.749
 it's violet and lion 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.070

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.070
 all right 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.979
 what song I wanted to sing and I do not know 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:22.229
 a thousand things happen in addition with tubes all 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.229
 it's easier how about your first day 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.730
 happy 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.620
 because your face tells me something else 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.669
 but there is 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.120
 Violet 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.120
 waiting 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.250
 you came for the exercises of 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.220
 angina good 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.370
 does not come for the exercises 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.350
 I came because I saw you wrong and I needed 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.020
 go out with whom to talk I can be you 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.820
 in ear only one and the other is for the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.970
 music 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.970
 if this is going to happen 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.830
 I do not think it's because of the nerves of 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.830
 study is that as always you take 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.280
 I'll help you solve 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.280
