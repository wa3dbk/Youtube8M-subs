00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.080

 the steps in video then we start 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.860
 this recipe by taking a small 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.350
 salad bowl you will place your 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.050
 philadelphia you add the milk 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.690
 sweetened concentrate and we finish with the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.120
 lemon then once the lemon is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.440
 added you have more than mixing so at 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.510
 about a minute 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.790
 the preparation must be well 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.409
 homogeneous that everything is well mixed and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.570
 you'll see it's really going you 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.340
 give a nice cream in fact very 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.290
 creamy 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.820
 then when the cream is ready you 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 just go there booked and we're going 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.700
 take care now of 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.440
 speculoos and butter you take 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.059
 a small pan and over a very soft fire 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.070
 you will melt your butter 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.230
 when it is well melted you go 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.820
 simply add it and mix it with 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.710
 speculoos that you will have previously 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.930
 reduced to crumbs so be it you 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 made with a rolling pin you 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.630
 put the cakes in a bag of 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.280
 freezing and you crush that a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.080
 rolling pin either you pass it 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.780
 simply in a robot and you 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.729
 mix finely then you mix well 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.030
 to get a kind of dough a little 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.530
 little wet and sticky and then that's it 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.180
 all you have to do is draw up your 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 cheese cake so either take you as 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.440
 me makes a circle and actually I 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.940
 put a baking paper in the bottom and you 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.740
 close the hinge so to some sort of 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.110
 mold to miss either you can prepare 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.000
 individual Czechs so it's great 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.500
 fast it's even faster and faster 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.259
 in small verrines you put 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.390
 so the speculoos at the bottom you tamp 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.070
 well we crush you either with the bottom 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.350
 of a glass either with a spatula or even 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.880
 with your fingers it works very well so 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.830
 it's the base of the cheesecake so you have to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 to do it well must be crushed 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.060
 the speculoos 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.039
 then you just have to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.930
 so add your preparation with the 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.689
 philadelphia so you ask it at 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.909
 center is with a spatula you go 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.649
 simply slide on it for 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.060
 spread equitably everywhere this 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 cream 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 then you place and eventually a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.069
 plastic film because if you have 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.840
 things that they feel strong in 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.430
 your fridge like for example 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 shrimp or things I do not know or 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.500
 even cheese the cheesecake may 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.849
 take this perfume so be careful 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.250
 possibly put a plastic film 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.950
 it's better and you put it in the fridge 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.630
 so for about three hours at 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.769
 after three hours you go 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.989
 simply pass the blade of a knife 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 turn if you used like me 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.750
 this famous hinged mold 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.060
 otherwise if it's glasses good bah 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.160
 here you have more than eat them 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.940
 so you just unmould it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.830
 you pass the lava 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.299
 then you remove the hinge and 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.069

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.799
