00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
your graphics are set to fast you can

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
your graphics are set to fast you can
choose<00:00:47.039> between<00:00:47.129> fancy<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.700> fast<00:00:47.879> basically

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
choose between fancy and fast basically

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.639 
choose between fancy and fast basically
you<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> make<00:00:49.020> sure<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> fast

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you want to make sure this is fast

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.799 
you want to make sure this is fast
smooth<00:00:50.489> lighting<00:00:50.730> you're<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:51.690> sure

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
smooth lighting you're gonna make sure

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
smooth lighting you're gonna make sure
this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.110> stock<00:00:52.710> 'old<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.489> down

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is just stock 'old all the way down

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650 
this is just stock 'old all the way down
onto<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:55.640> three<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.760> I'll<00:00:57.149> never<00:00:57.329> use<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
onto off three now I'll never use this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
onto off three now I'll never use this
but<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.469> sure<00:00:58.500> smooth<00:00:58.800> Lighting's<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.219> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
but make sure smooth Lighting's off this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
but make sure smooth Lighting's off this
is<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.579> makes<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> lighting<00:01:00.480> blend

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
is what makes all the lighting blend

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.619 
is what makes all the lighting blend
together<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.059> interpolate<00:01:03.059> together<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
together and interpolate together you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.429 
together and interpolate together you
don't<00:01:03.809> turn<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.989> off

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
don't turn that off

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
don't turn that off
GUI<00:01:05.040> scale<00:01:05.250> becomes<00:01:05.729> irrelevant<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
GUI scale becomes irrelevant that's just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
GUI scale becomes irrelevant that's just
whatever<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.380> smell<00:01:08.070> Google<00:01:08.310> might<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
whatever you smell Google might be

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
whatever you smell Google might be
faster<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.360> isn't<00:01:09.680> brightness

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
faster but it probably isn't brightness

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.179 
faster but it probably isn't brightness
I<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:13.200> don't<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> matters<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I really don't think it matters this is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
I really don't think it matters this is
basically<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:14.970> bright<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> want

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
basically how like how bright you want

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.300 
basically how like how bright you want
to<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.070> really

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
to make it I like it really really

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.120 
to make it I like it really really
bright<00:01:17.460> helps<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.390> stuff<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bright helps with my stuff you want to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
bright helps with my stuff you want to
have<00:01:20.250> fog<00:01:20.490> off<00:01:20.840> then<00:01:21.840> we'll<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.049> into<00:01:22.200> details

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
have fog off then we'll go into details

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.990 
have fog off then we'll go into details
basically<00:01:23.340> we'll<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> list

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
basically we'll just go down the list

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
basically we'll just go down the list
every<00:01:24.960> single<00:01:24.990> option<00:01:25.380> has<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
every single option has something you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
every single option has something you
can<00:01:26.310> turn<00:01:26.430> off<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.729> uilleann<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
can turn off and uilleann this is just

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
can turn off and uilleann this is just
for<00:01:27.960> simple<00:01:28.350> max<00:01:28.740> max<00:01:29.400> frames<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.119> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
for simple max max frames that you can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.310 
for simple max max frames that you can
possibly<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:30.990> always<00:01:31.170> come<00:01:31.259> back

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
possibly get you can always come back

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
possibly get you can always come back
and<00:01:31.439> turn<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> few<00:01:31.829> things<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:33.390> turn

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and turn a few things on or off I turn

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.679 
and turn a few things on or off I turn
clouds<00:01:34.140> off<00:01:34.820> everything<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.060> these<00:01:36.210> trees

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

really<00:03:05.730> big<00:03:05.970> issue<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.010> take<00:03:08.250> render

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
really big issue you can take render

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.370 
really big issue you can take render
distance<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.970> put<00:03:09.060> all<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.540> way<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.690> tiny<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
distance and put all the way to tiny and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.350 
distance and put all the way to tiny and
this<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.250> mean<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.430> won't<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.000> far<00:03:12.150> you'll

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
this I mean you won't see as far you'll

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.090 
this I mean you won't see as far you'll
only<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.660> about<00:03:12.690> 20<00:03:13.019> 32<00:03:13.500> meters<00:03:13.830> which<00:03:13.950> will

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
only see about 20 32 meters which will

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.350 
only see about 20 32 meters which will
be<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.400> your<00:03:14.580> chunk<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.030> chunk<00:03:15.180> ahead

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
be about your chunk and of chunk ahead

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.110 
be about your chunk and of chunk ahead
of<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.569> which<00:03:16.170> isn't<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.709> far<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.730> will

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
of you which isn't that far but it will

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.729 
of you which isn't that far but it will
really<00:03:18.480> cut<00:03:18.780> down<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.200> processing

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
really cut down on the processing

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.770 
really cut down on the processing
constant<00:03:20.190> rendering<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.120> drop<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.450> down<00:03:21.690> if

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
constant rendering so drop that down if

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.180 
constant rendering so drop that down if
you<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.049> need<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.290> performance<00:03:22.890> general

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
you really need to performance general

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.110 
you really need to performance general
you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.459> leave<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> way<00:03:24.090> to

you can you leave this all the way to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.199 
you can you leave this all the way to
max<00:03:24.720> FPS<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.650> allow<00:03:25.829> your<00:03:26.040> computer<00:03:26.940> to

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
too much lag a meter I believe off as a

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.870 
too much lag a meter I believe off as a
better<00:06:25.770> way<00:06:25.919> to<00:06:25.979> have<00:06:26.160> yeah<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:26.729> lag

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
better way to have yeah and the lag

better way to have yeah and the lag
meter<00:06:27.120> now<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.780> turn<00:06:27.900> this<00:06:28.020> off<00:06:28.260> whether<00:06:29.100> off
