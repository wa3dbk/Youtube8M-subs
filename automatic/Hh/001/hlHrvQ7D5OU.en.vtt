00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 The world of robots continuously evolving with new technologies 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:21.940
 Also be referred to as the look-alike robot android movement apparent to the human Among them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:29.869
 So how is that android made? 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:31.220
 First, it takes a type from actual human beings in order to reproduce a human-like appearance 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.629
 goo 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.890
 Hmm 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.920
 2 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 Oh 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.590
 I'll finish the real thing through ummu fine molding 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.880
 Buy another pillar that supports android's humanity 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 It is expression and movement 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.260
 android is closest to human skin 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 Special silicon is used 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 This is a device called artificial muscle 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:23.220
 It is indispensable to reproduce complicated motion without human being 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.460
 Each one substitutes for human muscle 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.460
 It reproduces human-like facial expressions and movements 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:42.149
 We asked the data teacher who is the 12th company of android about the development philosophy 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:46.170
 Do not you do not know that Tteyuu that people limit what 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:50.470
 What is what heart I do think Te emotion 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.700
 It Tteyuu to study the android is 1 in many ways 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:02.830
 It's like thinking about human beings in terms of pursuing the character 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.610
 The reason is that let's make something useful to people two for I think we have to know the person 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.460
 Or 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.460
 with respect to people but I do not know that you say that android is now helpful 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.760
 Lots of colors 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.519
 Understand what 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.519
 Is an interesting part of Android research 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.460
 android already can only be done by humans in various scenes of our life 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.950
 It has been thought that 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:40.710
 We are starting to challenge customer service and actress models etc. 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:43.000
 The future human-robot boundary will be blurred slightly 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.370
 In our lives 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.370
 Robots are commonplace Water world is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.520
 It may be coming to there soon
