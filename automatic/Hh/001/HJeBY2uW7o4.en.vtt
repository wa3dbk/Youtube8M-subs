00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.420 

so<00:00:06.410> there<00:00:06.620> are<00:00:06.649> different<00:00:06.979> approaches<00:00:07.399> to

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
so there are different approaches to

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.270 
so there are different approaches to
admitted<00:00:08.180> rhythms<00:00:08.480> and<00:00:08.690> one<00:00:09.620> of<00:00:09.740> them<00:00:09.920> is<00:00:10.160> to

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
admitted rhythms and one of them is to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.560 
admitted rhythms and one of them is to
work<00:00:10.430> with<00:00:10.610> finger<00:00:10.910> patterns<00:00:11.269> and<00:00:11.480> different

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
work with finger patterns and different

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.070 
work with finger patterns and different
subdivisions<00:00:12.639> so<00:00:13.639> we<00:00:13.789> will<00:00:13.910> play<00:00:14.119> in<00:00:14.420> in<00:00:14.750> seven

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
subdivisions so we will play in in seven

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.200 
subdivisions so we will play in in seven
eight<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:15.500> we<00:00:16.250> will<00:00:16.400> play<00:00:16.550> seven<00:00:16.970> that<00:00:17.090> is

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
eight and we will play seven that is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.490 
eight and we will play seven that is
subdivided<00:00:17.480> three<00:00:18.050> four

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
subdivided three four

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.040 
subdivided three four
so<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.859> grouping<00:00:19.220> is<00:00:19.340> one<00:00:19.910> two<00:00:20.240> three<00:00:20.269> one<00:00:21.019> two

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
so the grouping is one two three one two

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.370 
so the grouping is one two three one two
three<00:00:21.410> four<00:00:22.160> one<00:00:22.550> two<00:00:22.759> three<00:00:23.300> one<00:00:23.630> two<00:00:23.660> three

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
three four one two three one two three

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.429 
three four one two three one two three
four<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:26.029> finger<00:00:26.240> pattern<00:00:26.599> is<00:00:26.749> right

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
four and the finger pattern is right

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.509 
four and the finger pattern is right
right<00:00:27.769> left<00:00:28.189> right<00:00:28.460> left<00:00:28.669> right<00:00:29.329> left<00:00:29.509> and<00:00:30.519> we

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
right left right left right left and we

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.550 
right left right left right left and we
start<00:00:31.759> by<00:00:31.939> playing<00:00:32.180> these<00:00:32.450> in<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.290> area

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
start by playing these in the area

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:53.200 
start by playing these in the area
around<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.920> game<00:00:51.340> now<00:00:52.340> we<00:00:52.400> can<00:00:52.610> play<00:00:52.850> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
around the game now we can play the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.330 
around the game now we can play the
Exxon's<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.110> rhythm<00:00:54.410> which<00:00:54.770> are<00:00:55.130> the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
Exxon's of the rhythm which are the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.820 
Exxon's of the rhythm which are the
first<00:00:55.700> and<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.120> fourth<00:00:56.450> stroke<00:00:56.930> on<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.680> day

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
first and the fourth stroke on the day

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:22.630 
first and the fourth stroke on the day
sounds<00:00:58.580> like<00:00:58.700> this<00:00:58.820> and<00:01:21.010> now<00:01:22.010> we<00:01:22.070> keep<00:01:22.430> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
sounds like this and now we keep the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.370 
sounds like this and now we keep the
same<00:01:22.850> thing<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.180> pattern<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:23.870> we<00:01:24.080> create

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
same thing a pattern but we create

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.710 
same thing a pattern but we create
variations<00:01:24.680> by<00:01:25.670> playing<00:01:26.180> some<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.510> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
variations by playing some of the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.590 
variations by playing some of the
strokes<00:01:26.960> on<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.350> tone<00:01:27.530> field<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:29.540> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
strokes on the tone field and this is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.149 
strokes on the tone field and this is
going<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.930> sound<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.320> little<00:01:30.440> bit<00:01:30.680> different<00:01:31.100> on

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
going to sound a little bit different on

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.680 
going to sound a little bit different on
your<00:01:31.280> instrument<00:01:31.729> depending<00:01:32.150> on<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
your instrument depending on on the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.670 
your instrument depending on on the
scale<00:01:32.960> or<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.170> tuning<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:33.950> but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
scale or the tuning that you have but

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.620 
scale or the tuning that you have but
usually<00:01:36.680> if<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:37.010> orientate<00:01:37.850> yourself<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
usually if you orientate yourself on the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.810 
usually if you orientate yourself on the
the<00:01:39.170> position<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.710> face<00:01:39.890> it's<00:01:40.130> probably

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the position of the face it's probably

00:01:40.820 --> 00:02:18.009 
the position of the face it's probably
going<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.030> sound<00:01:41.210> nice<00:01:48.280> we're<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.490> same

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.000 

so<00:02:19.019> let's<00:02:19.260> play<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> couple<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.739> variations

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so let's play a couple of variations

00:02:20.010 --> 00:03:05.720 
so let's play a couple of variations
each<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.940> four<00:02:21.120> times<00:03:03.920> now<00:03:04.920> if<00:03:05.130> we<00:03:05.250> play<00:03:05.459> each

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
each one four times now if we play each

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.460 
each one four times now if we play each
variation<00:03:06.090> once<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:07.019> bit<00:03:07.109> faster

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
variation once and a little bit faster

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:39.180 
variation once and a little bit faster
it<00:03:07.680> creates<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.040> nice<00:03:08.160> melody

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.250 

next<00:03:40.190> we<00:03:40.310> can<00:03:40.489> add<00:03:40.670> another<00:03:41.090> sound<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.720> this

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
next we can add another sound in this

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.030 
next we can add another sound in this
case<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.770> slept<00:03:43.280> with<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.519> left<00:03:43.700> hand<00:03:45.040> we'll

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
case a slept with the left hand we'll

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.890 
case a slept with the left hand we'll
just<00:03:46.220> play<00:03:46.370> between<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.209> tone<00:03:47.390> fields<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
just play between the tone fields and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.470 
just play between the tone fields and
you<00:03:48.680> want<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:48.950> make<00:03:49.069> it<00:03:49.250> sound<00:03:49.790> as<00:03:50.090> sharp<00:03:50.330> as

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
you want to make it sound as sharp as

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.360 
you want to make it sound as sharp as
possible<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.140> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> sound<00:03:51.800> different

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
possible it is going to sound different

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.670 
possible it is going to sound different
depending<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.330> which<00:03:54.110> instrument<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:54.650> use

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
depending on which instrument you use

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.380 
depending on which instrument you use
first<00:03:55.100> generation<00:03:55.580> hime<00:03:55.760> second-generation

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390

harm<00:03:56.870> bears<00:03:57.620> SPB<00:03:58.370> halo<00:03:58.790> they<00:03:59.269> all<00:03:59.450> sound<00:04:00.019> a

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
harm bears SPB halo they all sound a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.520 
harm bears SPB halo they all sound a
little<00:04:00.200> bit<00:04:00.380> affirmative<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:02.140> we<00:04:03.140> play<00:04:03.380> this

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
little bit affirmative and we play this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:27.550 
little bit affirmative and we play this
one<00:04:03.739> right<00:04:03.950> after<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.280> second<00:04:04.730> day<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:26.560> we

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
one right after the second day and we

00:04:27.560 --> 00:05:04.719 
one right after the second day and we
can<00:04:27.740> go<00:04:27.919> through<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.550> same<00:04:28.760> melody

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.159 

okay<00:05:05.729> so<00:05:05.789> now<00:05:06.630> let's<00:05:06.840> play<00:05:06.990> one<00:05:07.139> more

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
okay so now let's play one more

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.620 
okay so now let's play one more
variation<00:05:07.560> which<00:05:07.949> uses<00:05:08.280> some<00:05:08.310> more<00:05:08.729> some<00:05:09.599> more

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
variation which uses some more some more

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:23.540 
variation which uses some more some more
strokes<00:05:10.169> on<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.410> tongue<00:05:10.590> feels<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:22.550> the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
strokes on the tongue feels and the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.610 
strokes on the tongue feels and the
silver<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.120> same<00:05:24.389> hand<00:05:24.780> pattern<00:05:25.080> right

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
silver in the same hand pattern right

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.290 
silver in the same hand pattern right
right<00:05:25.919> left<00:05:26.220> right<00:05:26.340> left<00:05:26.520> right<00:05:26.820> left<00:05:26.970> which

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
right left right left right left which

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:49.339 
right left right left right left which
is<00:05:27.419> all<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.990> time<00:05:28.169> going<00:05:28.380> through<00:05:48.050> if<00:05:49.050> you

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
is all the time going through if you

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.779 
is all the time going through if you
play<00:05:49.500> all<00:05:49.740> these<00:05:49.860> variations<00:05:50.190> after<00:05:50.729> each

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
play all these variations after each

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.820 
play all these variations after each
other<00:05:51.000> it<00:05:51.479> creates<00:05:51.690> a<00:05:51.960> nice<00:05:52.080> sequence<00:05:52.560> that

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830
