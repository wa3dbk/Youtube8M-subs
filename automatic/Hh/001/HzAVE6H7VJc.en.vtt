it over to Footwear and round out with
some<00:00:37.230> accessories<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.280> our<00:00:38.610> solar<00:00:38.940> camo<00:00:39.360> shirt

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
some accessories so our solar camo shirt

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.119 
some accessories so our solar camo shirt
is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.649> UV<00:00:41.640> activated<00:00:42.329> solar<00:00:42.750> camo<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.829> what

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
is a UV activated solar camo and so what

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.650 
is a UV activated solar camo and so what
I'm<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.879> seen<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.450> believe

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I'm going to do here is seen as believe

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
I'm going to do here is seen as believe
in<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.289> demonstrate<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
in I'm going to actually demonstrate the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.080 
in I'm going to actually demonstrate the
technology<00:00:47.640> itself<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> say<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.879> be

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
technology itself so I say you be

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
technology itself so I say you be
activated<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.800> sunlight<00:00:53.070> hits

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
activated in that when the sunlight hits

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.450 
activated in that when the sunlight hits
it<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.480> actually<00:00:55.230> causes<00:00:55.649> portions<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it it actually causes portions of the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.630 
it it actually causes portions of the
shirt<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.030> lighter<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.920> also<00:00:59.100> reacts

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
shirt to get lighter and it also reacts

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.540 
shirt to get lighter and it also reacts
with<00:00:59.910> body<00:01:00.149> temperature<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> these<00:01:01.949> darker

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
with body temperature so these darker

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
with body temperature so these darker
spots<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:03.449> darker<00:01:03.930> based<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:05.070> you're

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
spots get darker based on how you're

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
spots get darker based on how you're
running<00:01:05.519> temperature<00:01:05.790> wise<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> sinking

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
running temperature wise so the sinking

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.450 
running temperature wise so the sinking
in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> inspiration<00:01:08.010> behind<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
in the inspiration behind the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
in the inspiration behind the
development<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.119> technology<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.869> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
development of this technology was be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690 
development of this technology was be
partnered<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.830> scientist<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
partnered with a scientist here in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
partnered with a scientist here in
Florida<00:01:12.150> who'd<00:01:12.689> been<00:01:12.869> studying<00:01:13.320> Birds<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
Florida who'd been studying Birds and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
Florida who'd been studying Birds and
the<00:01:14.340> darker<00:01:14.790> birds<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.240> found<00:01:15.509> 10<00:01:16.290> tended<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the darker birds he found 10 tended to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
the darker birds he found 10 tended to
catch<00:01:17.520> less<00:01:17.970> fish<00:01:18.299> than<00:01:18.630> those<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> look

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
catch less fish than those that look

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
catch less fish than those that look
lighter<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.549> potentially<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> clouds<00:01:21.479> was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
lighter like potentially the clouds was

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
lighter like potentially the clouds was
the<00:01:21.900> theory<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.409> we'd<00:01:22.590> mimics<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.430> much

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the theory so we'd mimics that very much

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850 
the theory so we'd mimics that very much
here<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.180> technology<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.470> are

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
here with this technology and and are

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.499 
here with this technology and and are
promising<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.520> you'll<00:01:26.970> catch<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:27.299> fish

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
promising that you'll catch more fish

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.469 
promising that you'll catch more fish
when<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> wear<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.220> puppy's<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.850> UPF

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
when you wear it so this puppy's got UPF

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.499 
when you wear it so this puppy's got UPF
40<00:01:31.320> sun<00:01:31.740> protection<00:01:32.070> factor<00:01:32.270> it's<00:01:33.270> also

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
40 sun protection factor it's also

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.249 
40 sun protection factor it's also
antimicrobial<00:01:35.630> guilty<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> throwing<00:01:37.110> my

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
antimicrobial guilty of throwing my

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
antimicrobial guilty of throwing my
shirt<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> sack<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> rolling<00:01:39.150> back

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
shirt back in the sack and rolling back

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.480 
shirt back in the sack and rolling back
out<00:01:39.509> another<00:01:39.780> day<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.110> fishing<00:01:40.280> don't<00:01:41.280> want

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
out another day of fishing don't want

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
out another day of fishing don't want
that<00:01:41.610> stink<00:01:41.939> factor<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.659> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> helps

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that stink factor so that kind of helps

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.660 
that stink factor so that kind of helps
eliminate<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.799> bit<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.130> we've

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
eliminate a little bit of that we've

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
eliminate a little bit of that we've
also<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:45.119> strategic<00:01:45.329> venting<00:01:46.049> built<00:01:46.290> into

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
also got strategic venting built into

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.910 
also got strategic venting built into
this<00:01:46.680> shirt<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.750> iconic<00:01:48.960> pfg
