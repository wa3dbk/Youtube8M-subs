00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.140 
usually has oh no here we go again but
instead<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:50.690> instead<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.970> Dharma<00:03:53.970> has<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
instead then instead the Dharma has a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.659 
instead then instead the Dharma has a
happy<00:03:54.359> ending

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
happy ending

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.979

so<00:03:56.669> then<00:03:56.910> we<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:58.349> whole<00:03:58.560> set<00:03:58.889> of<00:03:59.010> books

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.140 
so then we have the whole set of books
so<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.199> you<00:04:01.319> wander<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.400> books<00:04:02.639> are<00:04:02.970> they
