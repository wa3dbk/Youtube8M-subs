00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.080
 hello how very good is welcome 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.030
 portal coches.net we are going to give us a 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.030
 back in this and a holy faith 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.090
 i 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.219
 to 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.370
 we started what we started, you know 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.170
 whenever we test a vehicle 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.300
 these characteristics we try 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
 show you a little of what it is capable of 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 to put the system that helps 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.770
 descend slopes 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.200
 he just slows down 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 the sound that you hear is that of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.439
 own brake is worth 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.479
 I would see my feet right now 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.289
 I'm playing any pedal I'm going to 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.880
 disconnect 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.780
 because we are already on terrain more or less 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 We follow a traction in a 4x4 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.530
 what would happen to disconnect when we leave 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.539
 to asphalt and well, we 've already seen 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 hyundai santa fe 4 meters and 69 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.860
 centimeters then of a 4x4 SUV or 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.069
 a suv as you want to call it then very 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.729
 current very very painter very well done very 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.979
 attractive on the outside as it has undergone a 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.549
 restyling that the truth is that he has 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.110
 So I left very nice and inside 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.769
 well you can already see the finish 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.470
 this unit we're talking about the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.530
 which has 197 horsepower with 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.590
 manual change and 4x4 traction there is a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 4 x 2 of 150 horses that is quite 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.450
 less equipped and that is by 31,000 and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.430
 few euros this is around 40 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.780
 thousand with manual change with change 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.800
 automatic you have to add about three thousand 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.170
 euros 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.170
 Well let's go out on asphalt 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.270
 let's disconnect the 4x4 drive 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.730
 let's go single front wheel drive 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.320
 and good for now is that with these 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.810
 tires that leads to this unit 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.500
 asphalt here is going to show much better 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.960
 that out of the asphalt what happens is that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.510
 well the traction the weight really 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.280
 etcetera, they make it accessible 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.670
 for that type of terrain they are broken 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.640
 as we have seen and jolin 40,000 strips 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.000
 euros a little expensive not so look does not have 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.580
 cheat if it seems expensive 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.050
 then you look inside, you see that 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.730
 has a choice of up to seven seats 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.580
 two rear seats are a little more and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.990
 looks but 77 adults can go the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.840
 point a to point b with enough 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.250
 comfort has a 585 boot 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 liters when it is five configuration 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.310
 squares you will see in some photo that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.380
 it has an absolutely flat floor and that 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.270
 with two squares has a capacity of 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.280
 brutal charge then comes equipped up 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.490
 up and you see how good it is because it's very 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.580
 pretty a browser in fact 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.000
 a system that regulates the direction be 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.190
 softer more sporty speed 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.100
 Cruising a computer on board 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.020
 decent a reservoir capacity of 64 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.070
 liters and above all a consumption is us 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.390
 making a consumption 17.7 liters in mixed 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.310
 the truth for a thousand 840 kilos and for 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.070
 well then to have it removed too 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.360
 to the field sometime but we think 200 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.060
 horses we are talking almost 200 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.670
 diesel horses we think a few 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.100
 7.7 figures decent enough we're not going 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.570
 to cheat otherwise the car is 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.030
 It behaves very well on the highway, it's very 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.090
 comfortable 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.610
 they do not have the inertias that the 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.320
 minivans or the all-terrain vehicles 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.670
 no longer every time the systems are much 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.620
 more modern and the truth is that it is very 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.750
 well out of the asphalt because you've already 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
 seen that is not a 4x4 all-rounder 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.130
 pure but the truth is that it behaves 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.529
 because with dignity it does not have enough 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.009
 traction capacity and well then 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.809
 you can save the ballot of that car 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.999
 mixed for a broken for a 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:46.039
 unstitched what happens I insist is that 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:51.139
 well it 's 150 diesel horses for 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:53.569
 32,500 and 40 1200 with 4x4 traction 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.709
 let's say to be a hyundai with everything 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.169
 what that entails because the truth is 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:58.879
 which is money sure in some other 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.709
 mark for that money you find the game 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.980
 not only with more prestige but also the best 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.870
 a little more practical yet 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.230
 I believe that this SUV fulfills a 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.450
 MPV function with the capacity 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.520
 what's behind that many others do not 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.360
 meet and only four meters away 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.590
 new and 69 centimeters long so 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.010
 well a little more to say now it's worth 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.510
 you know a little preview video to 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.130
 what will be the extensive analysis that 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.200
 we do in portal coches.net website 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.490
 reference of the motor world and how 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.080
 We always appreciate you being there and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.640
 see you in this or the next one and 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.640
 you know, you send it up soon
