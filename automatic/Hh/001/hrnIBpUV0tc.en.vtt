00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.860
 gentile travelers sometimes there are 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.680
 a little more nasty good I said a 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.880
 explained we are not here to say 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.410
 on the contrary, we are here to share 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.490
 a passion that is the make-up that 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.630
 mainly the same as the make up this 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.290
 even if we're talking about lots more 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130
 things even if you give in with tricks 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.050
 all things in life 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.850
 but at the base we are here to make up 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.500
 because we like it because we want 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.850
 share our tips because we want 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.850
 share a find 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.310
 this is really important which I 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.080
 thank you for being here for that's it 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.490
 remains the main after the stories 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.050
 that there is what does what did 6 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.310
 whence it comes or produced some 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.560
 this thing but I want to tell you that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.500
 we leave that aside it's not that the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 main thing is that you find here 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.740
 the kick board so you need 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.960
 you can talk about what you 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.520
 grab what those enough of those that 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.440
 you like 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.790
 and here we are here to make up for 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.260
 to live this passion and it's a pleasure 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.790
 because good a few years ago 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.320
 when we are but something apart 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.510
 with our girlfriends we could not 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.880
 share and then ben 14000 girlfriend 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.290
 and we can all exchange and those who 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.000
 think they are isolated with a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.530
 problem is great because we can 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.360
 find in power that we are not the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.030
 only to have this concern that we are not 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.800
 the only one not to get an eye 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.320
 liner or not found its background color 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.000
 complexion and that's it's really what 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.470
 I like it in our channels youtube the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.330
 youtube channel in youtube channels 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.970
