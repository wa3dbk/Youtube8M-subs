00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this for a design team project I want to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.690 
this for a design team project I want to
do<00:00:38.870> four<00:00:39.870> or<00:00:39.899> five<00:00:40.260> maybe<00:00:40.620> even<00:00:40.800> six<00:00:41.010> different

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
tags that are really different something

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.760 
tags that are really different something
simple<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.670> people<00:00:44.730> who<00:00:45.210> maybe<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.770> beginner

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
simple for people who maybe are beginner

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.299 
simple for people who maybe are beginner
and<00:00:47.120> then<00:00:48.120> maybe<00:00:48.480> people<00:00:49.350> who<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.649> into<00:00:50.100> more

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and then maybe people who are into more

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
and then maybe people who are into more
mixed<00:00:50.610> media<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
mixed media so this is the one that I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.510 
mixed media so this is the one that I
made<00:00:52.500> today<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.620> stamp<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.340> i

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
made today and the stamp that i use i

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
made today and the stamp that i use i
actually<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.469> know

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
actually don't have it out I don't know

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
actually don't have it out I don't know
where<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> prima<00:01:00.780> doll

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
where I put it but it is the prima doll

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.250 
where I put it but it is the prima doll
stamps<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.219> here's<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.879> tag<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.719> figured

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
stamps but here's this tag so I figured

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
stamps but here's this tag so I figured
this<00:01:04.439> might<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.369> more<00:01:06.299> advanced<00:01:07.140> maybe<00:01:07.610> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this might be a more advanced maybe so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.160 
this might be a more advanced maybe so
I'm<00:01:08.729> trying<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.450> different<00:01:09.840> levels

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I'm trying to do like different levels

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
I'm trying to do like different levels
of<00:01:10.320> tags<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:14.060> thought<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.360> cute<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of tags so I thought it was cute but I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
of tags so I thought it was cute but I
don't<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> guys<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.549> it's
