00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.559 
smoothie for myself and I was gonna run
back<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.680> got<00:02:30.069> two<00:02:30.280> mile<00:02:31.409> 13<00:02:32.409> 14<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:33.400> my<00:02:34.180> left

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
back so I got two mile 13 14 and my left

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.729 
back so I got two mile 13 14 and my left
leg<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.590> went<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.930> locked<00:02:37.930> up<00:02:38.319> and

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
leg just kind of went and locked up and

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.740 
leg just kind of went and locked up and
it<00:02:39.189> wasn't<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> lot<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.819> pain<00:02:40.060> or<00:02:40.239> anything<00:02:40.299> but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it wasn't a lot of pain or anything but

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.539 
it wasn't a lot of pain or anything but
it<00:02:40.900> was<00:02:40.989> just<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.560> know<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.709> think<00:02:41.950> my<00:02:42.189> muscle

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
it was just you know I think my muscle

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.289 
it was just you know I think my muscle
had<00:02:42.670> had<00:02:42.819> enough<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.980> um<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.069> think<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.909> answer

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
had had enough so um I think the answer

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.179 
had had enough so um I think the answer
to<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.599> I<00:02:46.780> attempted<00:02:47.409> to<00:02:47.470> do<00:02:47.680> too<00:02:47.980> much

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
to that is I attempted to do too much

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.550 
to that is I attempted to do too much
too<00:02:48.489> quickly<00:02:48.519> because<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.329> ramped<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.870> from

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
too quickly because I ramped up from

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.830 
too quickly because I ramped up from
maybe<00:02:50.859> a<00:02:50.980> month<00:02:51.189> ago<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.549> running<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.239> 20

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
maybe a month ago to running like 20

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.210 
maybe a month ago to running like 20
miles<00:02:53.260> during<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.459> course<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.540> week<00:02:55.780> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
miles during the course of a week and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.349 
miles during the course of a week and
last<00:02:57.220> week<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.730> did<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.950> 45<00:02:59.950> or<00:03:00.189> 47<00:03:00.669> miles<00:03:01.030> during

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
last week I did a 45 or 47 miles during

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.559 
last week I did a 45 or 47 miles during
the<00:03:01.510> course<00:03:01.689> of<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> week<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.939> that's<00:03:03.939> a<00:03:04.180> really

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
the course of a week so that's a really

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.599 
the course of a week so that's a really
big<00:03:04.720> increase<00:03:05.230> really<00:03:05.680> quickly<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:06.159> i<00:03:06.400> think

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
big increase really quickly so i think

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.270 
big increase really quickly so i think
what<00:03:07.329> i<00:03:07.389> have<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.780> do<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.099> i'm
