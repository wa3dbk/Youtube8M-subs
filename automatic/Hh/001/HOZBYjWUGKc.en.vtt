00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.540 

I<00:01:00.020> expected<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.040> most<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.460> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I expected it looks like most of it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.709 
I expected it looks like most of it
actually<00:01:02.820> stayed<00:01:03.059> together<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> looks<00:01:03.540> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
actually stayed together it looks like

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.190 
actually stayed together it looks like
just<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:05.060> little<00:01:06.060> panels<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> side

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
just the little panels here on the side

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
just the little panels here on the side
and<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.250> gun<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.850> came<00:01:09.180> off<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
and the gun on the back came off a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
and the gun on the back came off a
little<00:01:10.080> bit<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.619> engines<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.159> top<00:01:11.369> but

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
little bit from the engines up top but

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
little bit from the engines up top but
really<00:01:12.509> this<00:01:12.720> set<00:01:12.960> stayed<00:01:13.290> together<00:01:13.530> very

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
really this set stayed together very

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.090 
really this set stayed together very
very<00:01:14.550> well<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.390> he<00:01:15.450> saw<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.050> replay<00:01:16.440> really

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
just the wings kind of shook and that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
just the wings kind of shook and that
was<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.680> much<00:01:19.890> happened<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.610> gonna<00:01:20.759> go

after<00:01:22.649> I<00:01:22.680> fix<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> I'll<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:23.820> back

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
after I fix it up so I'll be right back

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
after I fix it up so I'll be right back
okay<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.130> before<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.790> um

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
okay and as you can see before you um

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
okay and as you can see before you um
it's<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.390> fixed<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.470> ahead

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's now fixed up and I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.430 
it's now fixed up and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:28.649> drop<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:30.450> nose-first<00:01:31.080> like

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
and drop this thing like nose-first like

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.740 
and drop this thing like nose-first like
a<00:01:31.470> kamikaze<00:01:32.009> type<00:01:32.399> thing<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.539> see

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a kamikaze type thing so we're gonna see

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
a kamikaze type thing so we're gonna see
how<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.840> goes<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> hopefully<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> causes

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
how that goes and hopefully it causes

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
how that goes and hopefully it causes
some<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.030> damage<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.810> let's<00:01:37.440> jump<00:01:37.649> right

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
some more damage so let's jump right

00:01:37.740 --> 00:02:04.930 
some more damage so let's jump right
into<00:01:37.979> it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.040 

okay<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.300> we<00:02:06.510> have<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.690> definitive

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
okay so I think we have a definitive

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.740 
okay so I think we have a definitive
answer<00:02:07.410> on<00:02:07.910> what<00:02:08.910> destroys<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.420> gunship

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
answer on what destroys the gunship

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.740 
answer on what destroys the gunship
better<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.039> nose<00:02:11.250> first<00:02:11.750> as

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
better and that would be nose first as

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.150 
better and that would be nose first as
you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.830> see

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
you can see

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.680 
you can see
nose<00:02:14.310> nose<00:02:14.340> first<00:02:14.910> definitely<00:02:15.300> did<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.480> job

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
nose nose first definitely did the job

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
nose nose first definitely did the job
over<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.320> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.950> give<00:02:17.130> me<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> second

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
over there and if you give me a second

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760 
over there and if you give me a second
I'm<00:02:17.580> gonna<00:02:17.700> charge<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.209> camera<00:02:19.140> battery<00:02:19.590> and
