samsung<00:03:52.979> galaxy<00:03:53.729> so<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.930> thought<00:03:55.169> you<00:03:55.229> know

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
samsung galaxy so I thought you know

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.110 
samsung galaxy so I thought you know
what<00:03:55.680> let's<00:03:55.919> just<00:03:55.979> go<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.639> samsung<00:03:56.939> galaxy

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
what let's just go with a samsung galaxy

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.210 
what let's just go with a samsung galaxy
because<00:03:57.659> it's<00:03:57.870> cheaper<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.769> interface

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
because it's cheaper and the interface

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.399 
because it's cheaper and the interface
looks<00:03:59.430> completely<00:04:00.000> different<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.989> iPhone

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
looks completely different to the iPhone

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.330 
looks completely different to the iPhone
because<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.709> know<00:04:01.829> when<00:04:01.949> you<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.159> a<00:04:02.189> new

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340
