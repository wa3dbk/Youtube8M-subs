 of fifa tips and today we are going to see how it is 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.669
 in the title the best fifa team 13 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.110
 for me in my personal opinion is the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.230
 manchester would be more explain why 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.730

 always among all the formative 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.460
 I want to tell you that this is the end of 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.930
 season the fifa tit 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.250

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.980

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.519
 daily on Wednesday fifa you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.019
 commenting and leaving his like so he 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.609
 Thank you very much thanks to my channel 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.769
 seriously that gave me the opportunity if 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.329
 there would be this series with a chance that 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.969
 Iguana was not climbing anymore 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.859
 problems that he had personal but good 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.719
 I hope 14 orb in the third series 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.210
 formative and good let's spend what 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.610
 is to analyze because this is the best 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 fifa team and as far as I 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.500
 concerns I think the bad alignment 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.750
 to be able to use it and is the one that best puts 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.990
 in practice everything that brings end 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.820
 matrices and good alignment very good 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.649
 the alignment is of the following 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.079
 way the goalkeeper the three defenses 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.600
 central maicon company and pole for 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.060
 explain why I like and good javi 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.250
 I already had as msd but in two 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.570
 position so mdd and m 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.950
 dm we already have the Chinese silva davis went and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.860
 I do not see the forward but I have it 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.920
 in me because it's pretty fast and I 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.020
 it serves quite well in this position of ms or 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 we have no one to serve us too 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.189
 table but bustamante and the two 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 front that are dry and omen that does not 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.619
 matter where I go always 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.920
 game like green and from dry happening what 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.750
 which is already the party itself equal here is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.940
 where he looked at why I tell them that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.899
 are up here already auto enable the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.069
 Only taquitos will be excellent 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.459
 rating to put an excellent goal 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.470
 I liked the play a lot, that's why I 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.540
 I like it much more at rede rede ms or although 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.790
 the Chinese serve is also better but I 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.489
 I use it for the band so that together 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.660
 with tb is a very fast band to the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.549
 two players for the bands are 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.870
 excellent and good many wondered 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.150
 why did you use the line 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.400
 well here we can see were the three 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.080
 defenses of the other opponent and should 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.690
 to be four but one side always 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 will be the attack and there are only three left and 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.159
 the problem is badly located then 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 of the alignment is four defenses 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.379
 that the lateral defenses go up a lot 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.989
 that's why when using three defense 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.930
 and five means the defense is more 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.299
 protected here can you see me get out to 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.370
 mark came a little closer to the center and 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.950
 everything just turn around and me 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.859
 I take the defense and the other two 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 they are too leridanas goal because no 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.200
 it hits very well from long distance like that 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.599
 that's why he used the alignment of 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.910
 three defenses or because they are three defenses 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.190
 central and do not rise at all are 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.010
 always well located and apart they have 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.079
 help from media advocates 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.930
 defensive forgiveness then that 's the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.420
 point of alignment and here we go to 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 see another play by the bands as they 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.640
 said the Chinese and the Chinese silva and I 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.160
 they like it a lot because they go here as they see 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.230
 to ledger step I saw it and I go by all 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.030
 the band and it almost causes a 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.709
 goal play and they will see another play and 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.540
 I can see here on this occasion the medium 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.519
 defensive is always pretty would have 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.349
 the brand and well here steals it very 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.980
 excellent is given to the midfielder 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.099
 offensive and good here gives it to dry and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.049
 seco almost makes another goal opportunity to 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.000
 our team so with that I'm 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.680
 saying goodbye I hope that in the light of a 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.170
 good comment what do you expect from the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.360
 second season of fifa tips and we 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.360
 we see in a next video bye
