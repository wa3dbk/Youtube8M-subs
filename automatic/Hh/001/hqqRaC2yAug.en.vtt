 it's me it's being made of diaz on 2 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.579
 nine o'clock at night I know 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.379
 that almost we'll find us at 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.870
 less today conceived in 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.030
 santiago what the game is about 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.630
 imagine the is of space graphics 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.290
 improved 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.240
 with more minecraft for the open world and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.120
 put a rpg game because it has the 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.400
 level I do not know how to explain it in 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.410
 fusion to walk on next of space and 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.410
 minecraft and it's something like light 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.310
 our gifts see that I would try to have 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.960
 kill a monster 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.360
 the ship probability I have to kill a 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.810
 monster is chasing me 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.810
 few very few you see that the tele metro 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.670
 does not run runs runs runs 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.670
 Lady me 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.320
 no no no 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.430
 let's take a witch 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:04.630
 I did not die is not that the funniest thing 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.360
 come back and next side I would refer to the side is 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.180
 the way there is a horse 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:21.539
 you can catch one of the horses 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.280
 but now it's not illiterate it 's in 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.680
 'passion' is a very future egg 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 look what it has being in good day 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.780
 here we can at the bonfires we can 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.490
 cook our food I do not know where you are 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.000
 well I am rasa I do not sink to I am 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.030
 a warrior and a unique map because they stick 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.530
 beard is so good help of 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.340
 kill me 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:52.230
 the team is impossible to see the advantage 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.230
 is that we are very close already we arrived 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:12.580
 we hope that tonight the brightness at 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.770
 video so you can see it well but 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.680
 at night you can not see 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:24.420
 nothing I'm crap for god I'm going to go to 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.950
 the one you're watching follows my voice 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.170

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.070

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.210
 well I can cook this if what I 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:43.900
 I said right now in the kitchen the good thing in the 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:45.889
 facing the front you're already fantastic if 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.449
 it is a combination 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.909
 these guys that these little animals that are 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.479
 but hey guys it's fantastic 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.300
 definitely what I liked the most 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.009
 is the playability the gameplay and the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.610
 animations that is because they are game 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.199
 cubes but it's very well worked is the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 who told me that six years 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.949
 has been working in this game on 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.949
 creator is an indie game totally in 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.210
 16 years we are this type of pompadour 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.749
 with a bow in the back and look at me 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.749
 want to like me 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.280
 look at the background 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.200
 but it does not matter 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:34.040
 efe 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.450
 I have a good torch, there is the stamina 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.390
 we had counted we can climb 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.800
 walls no gentlemen is the first impression 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.650
 I have not played the game 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.450
 in the same as the castle measure the 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.640
 boxing and level 1 of the show that finished 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.030
 create the character my brother I already saw it to 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.170

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.170

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.620
 run and good teams you can not kill 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.870
 it's really a knock element a 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.790

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.790

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.590
 peak chapter will be that entering the 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.200

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.920

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.920
 place 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.970
 if we sleep it becomes day 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:33.660
