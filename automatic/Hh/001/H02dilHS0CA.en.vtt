I've store
away<00:02:22.260> from<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> idea<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> didn't<00:02:23.610> know

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
away from the idea as I didn't know

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.120 
away from the idea as I didn't know
whether<00:02:24.780> people<00:02:25.050> would<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.380> want<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
whether people would actually want to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.010 
whether people would actually want to
watch<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.210> well<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.780> because

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
watch it or how well it would do because

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.140 
watch it or how well it would do because
there's<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.590> many<00:02:28.710> out<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.030> series<00:02:30.030> like

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there's so many out there series like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
there's so many out there series like
that<00:02:30.270> though<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> would<00:02:30.630> be<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.960> easier<00:02:30.990> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that though it would be a lot easier to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070 
that though it would be a lot easier to
make<00:02:32.210> also<00:02:33.210> there's<00:02:33.420> anything<00:02:33.630> else<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.960> like

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
make also there's anything else you like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
make also there's anything else you like
to<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> regular<00:02:35.220> video<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.700> let<00:02:35.850> me

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
to see as a regular video then let me

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.670 
to see as a regular video then let me
know<00:02:36.060> as<00:02:36.180> well<00:02:36.360> I'm<00:02:36.780> think<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> new<00:02:37.410> series

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
know as well I'm think of a new series

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.500 
know as well I'm think of a new series
to<00:02:38.010> change<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.640> score<00:02:39.060> bases<00:02:39.240> scored

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to change up the score bases scored

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.970 
to change up the score bases scored
series<00:02:39.780> as<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.170> do<00:02:40.230> believe<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.830> good

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
series as I do believe it's a good

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740 
series as I do believe it's a good
series<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.700> been<00:02:41.850> getting<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.330> lot<00:02:42.540> less

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
series but it's been getting a lot less

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.510 
series but it's been getting a lot less

the move use it got which meant a lot of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.480 
the move use it got which meant a lot of
the<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:00.930> unique<00:03:01.350> teams<00:03:01.830> didn't<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:02.370> many

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
the more unique teams didn't get as many
