00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
opinion playing claw it's probably more

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.539 
opinion playing claw it's probably more
beneficial<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> new<00:01:52.079> control<00:01:52.560> scheme<00:01:52.860> but

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
beneficial to the new control scheme but

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.929 
beneficial to the new control scheme but
if<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> play<00:01:55.350> claw<00:01:55.939> maybe
