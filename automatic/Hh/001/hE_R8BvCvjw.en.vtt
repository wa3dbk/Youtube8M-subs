00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
take this one optic and team kaliber and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.240 
take this one optic and team kaliber and
just<00:02:14.200> let<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.380> guys<00:02:14.470> know<00:02:14.620> how<00:02:14.710> pool<00:02:15.010> play

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
just let you guys know how pool play

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
just let you guys know how pool play
works<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:16.270> tomorrow<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.410> way<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.560> pool

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
works for tomorrow the way that pool

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.500 
works for tomorrow the way that pool
play<00:02:18.069> works<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.580> play<00:02:18.940> everybody<00:02:19.360> in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
play works is that you play everybody in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.180 
play works is that you play everybody in
your<00:02:19.720> group<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.380> two<00:02:20.560> teams<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:21.069> the

that is going to be optic gaming a team

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.020 
that is going to be optic gaming a team
kaliber<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.470> it'll<00:02:39.460> be<00:02:39.520> interesting<00:02:39.730> and

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
kaliber and it'll be interesting and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.700 
kaliber and it'll be interesting and
awesome<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.570> watch<00:02:40.690> them<00:02:41.050> go<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.350> against<00:02:41.650> each

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
awesome to watch them go up against each

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.370 
awesome to watch them go up against each
other<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.160> morning<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.900> those<00:02:44.140> are<00:02:44.290> my

going to be number one in that group I

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.229 
going to be number one in that group I
can<00:03:08.800> have<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.980> most<00:03:09.130> wins<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.700> think<00:03:10.120> they're

can have the most wins I think they're

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.520 
can have the most wins I think they're
gonna<00:03:10.330> walk<00:03:10.599> through<00:03:10.810> most<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.290> teams

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
gonna walk through most of the teams

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.729 
gonna walk through most of the teams
including<00:03:12.099> epsilon<00:03:12.580> epsilon<00:03:13.140> i<00:03:14.140> think<00:03:14.620> is

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
including epsilon epsilon i think is

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.530 
including epsilon epsilon i think is
going<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.950> make<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.220> out<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:15.580> this<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.360> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
going to make it out but this is the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.300 
going to make it out but this is the
best<00:03:16.840> opportunity<00:03:17.080> for<00:03:17.500> an<00:03:17.590> upset<00:03:17.980> i<00:03:18.099> think

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
best opportunity for an upset i think

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.039 
best opportunity for an upset i think
there's<00:03:18.459> gonna<00:03:18.519> be<00:03:18.610> two<00:03:18.760> upsets<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.780> top

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
there's gonna be two upsets the top

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.539 
there's gonna be two upsets the top
eight<00:03:20.290> teams<00:03:20.319> on<00:03:20.799> sunday<00:03:21.069> morning<00:03:21.340> are<00:03:21.430> not

think<00:03:23.590> one<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.160> upsets<00:03:24.519> is<00:03:24.640> going<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.819> come

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
think one of the upsets is going to come

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.089

pretty much everybody saying right now
they're<00:05:01.840> probably<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.439> top<00:05:02.590> team<00:05:02.860> now<00:05:03.340> of

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
course it's still I don't think you

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.860 
course it's still I don't think you
could<00:05:05.409> take<00:05:05.620> away<00:05:05.949> complexity<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.150> their

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
could take away complexity and their

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.020 
could take away complexity and their
skill<00:05:08.379> in<00:05:08.530> their<00:05:08.680> ability<00:05:09.159> I<00:05:09.340> do<00:05:09.550> think

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
skill in their ability I do think

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.390 
skill in their ability I do think
complexity<00:05:10.599> is<00:05:10.719> is<00:05:10.979> dealing<00:05:11.979> with<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.189> same

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
complexity is is dealing with the same

thing that impact dealt with after you

back<00:05:28.210> laundry<00:05:28.870> spawn<00:05:29.169> on<00:05:29.469> raid<00:05:29.830> hardpoint<00:05:30.400> and

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
back laundry spawn on raid hardpoint and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.300 
back laundry spawn on raid hardpoint and
he<00:05:31.000> said<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.599> stole<00:05:32.259> this<00:05:32.530> from<00:05:32.770> clay<00:05:33.069> stir

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
he said I stole this from clay stir

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.129 
he said I stole this from clay stir
because<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.639> thought<00:05:33.909> it<00:05:33.969> was<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.240> good<00:05:34.539> move<00:05:34.870> and

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
because I thought it was a good move and

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.369 
because I thought it was a good move and
so<00:05:35.889> people<00:05:36.849> are<00:05:37.150> going<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.599> look<00:05:37.810> at<00:05:37.930> your<00:05:38.139> game

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:38.379 
so people are going to look at your game

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.839 
so people are going to look at your game
play<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.830> they're<00:05:39.039> going<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.280> steal<00:05:39.550> whatever

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
play and they're going to steal whatever

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.790 
play and they're going to steal whatever
you're<00:05:40.180> doing<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.629> works<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:41.169> so<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:41.680> think

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
you're doing that works and so I think

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.129 
you're doing that works and so I think
that<00:05:42.270> complexity<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.479> in<00:05:43.569> that<00:05:43.690> same<00:05:43.900> place

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
that complexity is in that same place

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.379 
that complexity is in that same place
unite<00:05:44.979> is<00:05:45.219> still<00:05:46.150> too<00:05:46.659> good<00:05:47.020> on<00:05:47.319> search<00:05:47.800> and

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
unite is still too good on search and

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.360 
unite is still too good on search and
they're<00:05:49.389> good<00:05:49.719> enough<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:50.349> hard<00:05:50.830> point<00:05:51.159> and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
they're good enough on hard point and

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.059 
they're good enough on hard point and
capture<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.120> flag<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.659> where<00:05:52.870> I<00:05:53.199> don't<00:05:53.740> know

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
capture the flag to where I don't know

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.529 
capture the flag to where I don't know
if<00:05:54.250> teams<00:05:54.520> are<00:05:54.669> gonna<00:05:54.729> be<00:05:54.940> able<00:05:55.029> to<00:05:55.210> take<00:05:55.389> them

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
if teams are gonna be able to take them

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:56.580 
if teams are gonna be able to take them
out<00:05:55.659> it's<00:05:55.779> gonna<00:05:55.870> be<00:05:55.960> really<00:05:56.139> interesting<00:05:56.560> to

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
out it's gonna be really interesting to

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.589 
out it's gonna be really interesting to
see<00:05:56.770> who<00:05:56.889> wins<00:05:57.159> this<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.939> think<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.360> beef

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
see who wins this and I think the beef

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.080 
see who wins this and I think the beef
between<00:05:58.629> complexity<00:05:59.529> and<00:05:59.740> unite<00:06:00.009> I<00:06:00.189> really

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
between complexity and unite I really

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.119 
between complexity and unite I really
hope<00:06:01.270> they<00:06:01.419> get<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:01.659> play<00:06:01.840> each<00:06:01.990> other<00:06:02.199> so<00:06:02.800> the

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
hope they get to play each other so the

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.180 
hope they get to play each other so the
most<00:06:03.310> anticipated<00:06:03.580> match<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.240> all<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.509> this<00:06:04.690> is

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
most anticipated match in all of this is

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.740 
most anticipated match in all of this is
optic<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.340> envy<00:06:06.580> playing<00:06:06.819> each<00:06:06.940> other<00:06:07.060> is<00:06:07.300> the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
optic and envy playing each other is the

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.510 
optic and envy playing each other is the
Merc<00:06:07.960> Jake<00:06:08.229> apps<00:06:08.469> which<00:06:08.740> going<00:06:09.129> up<00:06:09.219> against

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
Merc Jake apps which going up against

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.459 
Merc Jake apps which going up against
each<00:06:09.580> other<00:06:09.759> but<00:06:10.210> unfortunately<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:11.080> don't

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
each other but unfortunately I don't

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:12.990 
each other but unfortunately I don't
think<00:06:11.590> it's<00:06:11.770> going<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:11.919> happen<00:06:12.069> unless<00:06:12.430> they

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
think it's going to happen unless they

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.240 
think it's going to happen unless they
mix<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:13.449> up<00:06:13.569> and<00:06:13.750> they<00:06:13.900> say<00:06:14.199> that<00:06:14.710> after<00:06:14.949> the

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
mix it up and they say that after the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.709 
mix it up and they say that after the
first<00:06:15.460> round<00:06:15.699> when<00:06:16.029> they<00:06:16.150> put<00:06:16.330> those<00:06:16.449> eight

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
first round when they put those eight

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.809 
first round when they put those eight
teams<00:06:16.990> together<00:06:17.169> on<00:06:17.440> Sunday<00:06:17.860> that<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.460> teams

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
teams together on Sunday that the teams

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.159 
teams together on Sunday that the teams
from<00:06:18.909> Group<00:06:19.150> A<00:06:19.270> are<00:06:19.509> going<00:06:19.629> to<00:06:19.690> play<00:06:19.839> the<00:06:19.990> teams

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
from Group A are going to play the teams

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.040 
from Group A are going to play the teams
from<00:06:20.289> groups<00:06:20.560> see<00:06:20.830> that's<00:06:21.339> the<00:06:21.550> only<00:06:22.150> way<00:06:22.389> that

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
from groups see that's the only way that

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.809 
from groups see that's the only way that
will<00:06:23.199> see<00:06:23.409> an<00:06:23.500> optic<00:06:23.919> in<00:06:24.039> NV<00:06:24.370> matchup

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
will see an optic in NV matchup

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.059 
will see an optic in NV matchup
potentially<00:06:25.599> if<00:06:25.779> they<00:06:26.199> do<00:06:26.259> a<00:06:26.379> and<00:06:26.800> B<00:06:26.889> together

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
potentially if they do a and B together

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.100 
potentially if they do a and B together
and<00:06:27.460> C<00:06:27.669> and<00:06:27.819> D<00:06:27.909> together<00:06:28.240> I<00:06:28.509> think<00:06:29.020> the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
and C and D together I think the

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.170 
and C and D together I think the
complexity<00:06:29.740> is<00:06:29.979> going<00:06:30.279> to<00:06:30.370> walk<00:06:30.550> away<00:06:30.879> with

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
complexity is going to walk away with

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.659 
complexity is going to walk away with
all<00:06:31.750> of<00:06:32.080> with<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:32.440> with<00:06:32.830> winning<00:06:33.099> out<00:06:33.339> of<00:06:33.490> that

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
all of with the with winning out of that

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.999 
all of with the with winning out of that
group<00:06:34.000> a<00:06:34.210> and<00:06:34.449> I<00:06:35.080> think<00:06:35.319> optic<00:06:35.620> is<00:06:35.740> going<00:06:35.860> to<00:06:35.919> be

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
group a and I think optic is going to be

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:37.800 
group a and I think optic is going to be
either<00:06:36.190> be<00:06:36.400> upset<00:06:36.759> by<00:06:36.879> team<00:06:37.120> kaliber<00:06:37.479> or<00:06:37.690> by

either be upset by team kaliber or by

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.959 
either be upset by team kaliber or by
complexity<00:06:38.440> not<00:06:38.740> really<00:06:38.979> an<00:06:39.069> upset<00:06:39.490> everybody

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
complexity not really an upset everybody

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.390 
complexity not really an upset everybody
expects<00:06:40.659> complexity<00:06:41.229> at<00:06:41.830> this<00:06:42.009> point<00:06:42.219> in<00:06:42.339> the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.579 
expects complexity at this point in the
game<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:42.759> beat<00:06:42.969> optic<00:06:43.389> and<00:06:43.539> then<00:06:43.839> I<00:06:44.110> think<00:06:44.469> on

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:44.589 
game to beat optic and then I think on

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:46.350 
game to beat optic and then I think on
the<00:06:44.650> bottom<00:06:44.949> half<00:06:45.129> I<00:06:45.370> honestly<00:06:45.729> don't<00:06:45.909> know<00:06:46.029> I

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
the bottom half I honestly don't know I

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.219 
the bottom half I honestly don't know I
cnv<00:06:47.110> being<00:06:47.379> upset<00:06:47.800> or<00:06:48.639> beat<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:49.150> guess<00:06:49.449> by<00:06:49.810> I

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
cnv being upset or beat I guess by I

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.469 
cnv being upset or beat I guess by I
think<00:06:50.770> NV<00:06:51.039> could<00:06:51.190> lose<00:06:51.370> to<00:06:51.520> curse<00:06:51.759> and<00:06:52.029> then

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 
think NV could lose to curse and then

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:53.969 
think NV could lose to curse and then
Kirsten<00:06:52.870> unite<00:06:53.139> could<00:06:53.319> be<00:06:53.409> in<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.589> finals

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
Kirsten unite could be in the finals

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.790 
Kirsten unite could be in the finals
against<00:06:54.610> each<00:06:54.699> other<00:06:54.879> or<00:06:55.089> semi<00:06:55.389> finals<00:06:55.810> and<00:06:55.990> if

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
against each other or semi finals and if

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
I had to predict the finals right now

I had to predict the finals right now
