that smoke being drawn up to the
extraction<00:02:10.910> fan<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.540> honestly<00:02:12.020> thought<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
extraction fan I honestly thought the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.160 
extraction fan I honestly thought the
acid<00:02:13.190> would<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.550> done<00:02:13.670> more<00:02:13.790> damage<00:02:14.180> because

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
acid would have done more damage because

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.140 
acid would have done more damage because
when<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.560> think<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.980> acids<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.610> always

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
when you think of acids you always

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.060 
when you think of acids you always
associate<00:02:17.570> acids<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.050> being<00:02:18.290> these<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.890> you

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
associate acids as being these that you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.030 
associate acids as being these that you

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
coating it was a really experiment

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.390 
coating it was a really experiment
reaction<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.800> didn't<00:02:28.070> think<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.310> would

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
reaction and I didn't think I would

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.490 
reaction and I didn't think I would
actually<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.209> bubbling<00:02:30.020> away<00:02:30.140> like

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
actually see a can bubbling away like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.290 
actually see a can bubbling away like
that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.570 

that<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.260> incredible<00:02:38.800> isn't<00:02:38.950> it
