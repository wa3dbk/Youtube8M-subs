00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.459
 Prime Minister 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.019
 It becomes a priority road that turns this intersection 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.999
 But where the prospect is bad and accidents occur frequently 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.679
 On the road there is also a display of intersection warning and a curve mirror is also installed 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.710
 It has been 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.970
 When driving in a place where danger is expected even if it is a priority road 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.500
 To lower speed and jump out using curve mirror 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 be careful 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.450
 Make a steep slope and turn left at the light 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.450
 Alert subscribers to be alerted not to go down uniformly 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.500
 I passed while paying attention to pedestrians and bicycles 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 There is also a pedestrian crossing investment bank and I am Akihiro 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 I will establish this correctly 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.540
 Take a rival car and watch out for the turn of the season 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.350
 I will 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.520
 In addition, the information mechanism has decided to look closely and confirm the safety 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 Don't let me get confused and ask for a cross section 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.110
 It is slow enough because the road is narrow and poor 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.250
 I was prepared to avoid even if I jumped out 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
 I will see the safety confirmation of the left and right in the future 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:20.340
 The right turn lane at the intersection is another car from behind the refounder 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.049
 Be careful as it may be directed to bytes + 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:38.159
 Keep an eye on pedestrians and bicycles on the pedestrian crossing on the right side 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:38.599
