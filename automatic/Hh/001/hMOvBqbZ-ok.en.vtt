 cj is a magazine of the ventures but 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.530
 The problem with this magazine is that 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.840
 we can see the map and the life bar 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.640
 of the osea rockstar player committed a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.040
 error in doing this since it is assumed that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.110
 this should not appear or maybe 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.650

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.790
 painful at the same time is the drivers 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.790
 suicidal the location on the map is this 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.070
 good to be able to make the driver 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.260
 he commits suicide we will have to steal his car 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.900
 of UFO unidentified flying object to 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.090

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.090
 fun to explore the city ​​below 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 of the ground since we can see interiors 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.959

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.880

 poster of the burger shot and the mysterious and 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.780
 disgusting is that a menu says fitch and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.980
 which in Spanish means fish poop 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.980
 or fish shit 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.670
 and this police never do anything 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.630
 they deserve nothing this if you do not wear it would be 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.630
