00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
those twists tight like that and then
you're<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.520> take<00:02:23.580> your<00:02:23.820> right<00:02:24.210> side<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you're going to take your right side and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.560 
you're going to take your right side and
go<00:02:24.900> under<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.560> left<00:02:25.800> side<00:02:25.980> over<00:02:26.430> okay<00:02:27.270> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
go under and the left side over okay and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.180 
go under and the left side over okay and
that's<00:02:27.870> important<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.500> when<00:02:28.860> i<00:02:28.920> first

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that's important because when i first

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.770 
that's important because when i first
started<00:02:29.460> doing<00:02:29.580> them<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:30.000> was<00:02:30.450> kind<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.660> just

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
started doing them I was kind of just

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.810 
started doing them I was kind of just
joining<00:02:31.080> them<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.380> any<00:02:31.590> kind<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> way<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.490> it

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
joining them like any kind of way and it

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
joining them like any kind of way and it
was<00:02:32.850> not<00:02:33.150> working<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> need<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.620> go<00:02:34.860> in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
was not working so you need to go in

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.150 
was not working so you need to go in
that<00:02:35.250> direction<00:02:35.430> okay<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.890> that's<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.100> to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that direction okay and that's going to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.360 
that direction okay and that's going to
give<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> nice<00:02:39.140> kid<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
give you a nice kid in not it's going to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.310

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
be inside so you're not going to see it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020 
be inside so you're not going to see it
not<00:02:43.470> sitting<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.040> top<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.520> hair<00:02:44.760> it's
