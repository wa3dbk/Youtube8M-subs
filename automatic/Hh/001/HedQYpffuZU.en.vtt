let's<00:00:55.949> take<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> peek<00:00:56.399> inside<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.210> this

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
let's take a peek inside to see how this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
let's take a peek inside to see how this
thing<00:00:57.660> works<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.620> pretty<00:00:58.710> sparse<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
thing works it's pretty sparse on the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
thing works it's pretty sparse on the
interior<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.329> wanted<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.719> thing<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
interior because I wanted this thing to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.460 
interior because I wanted this thing to
be<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.530> basic<00:01:02.370> mobile<00:01:02.699> weapon<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> no-frills<00:01:04.110> all

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
be a basic mobile weapon a no-frills all

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
be a basic mobile weapon a no-frills all
kills<00:01:04.920> sort<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.320> being<00:01:07.590> said

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
kills sort of thing but that being said

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.450 
kills sort of thing but that being said
I<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:09.030> did<00:01:09.330> embellish<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.040> little<00:01:11.310> bit

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
I still did embellish just a little bit

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.179 
I still did embellish just a little bit
maybe<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.049> can't<00:01:13.049> help<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.470> love<00:01:13.860> doing

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
maybe I can't help but I just love doing

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
maybe I can't help but I just love doing
this<00:01:14.430> sort<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.729> thing<00:01:14.790> anyway<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this sort of thing anyway so the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.240 
this sort of thing anyway so the
interior<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.619> still<00:01:16.799> pretty<00:01:17.009> cool-looking

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
interior is still pretty cool-looking

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
interior is still pretty cool-looking
but<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> said<00:01:18.360> earlier<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> best<00:01:19.110> part<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but like I said earlier the best part of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
but like I said earlier the best part of
the<00:01:19.530> ship<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.159> weapons<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> way

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the ship are the weapons and the way

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390 
the ship are the weapons and the way
that<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.360> fire<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.590> done<00:01:22.920> by<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that they fire and that's done by a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
that they fire and that's done by a
series<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> groups<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> timer<00:01:25.590> blocks<00:01:25.979> it's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
series of groups and timer blocks it's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
series of groups and timer blocks it's
not<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.909> hard<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:27.509> set<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
not that hard to actually set up but the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.749 
not that hard to actually set up but the
effect<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> pretty<00:01:29.250> cool

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
effect is pretty cool

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
effect is pretty cool
basically<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.869> guns<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.320> grouped<00:01:31.560> into

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
basically the guns are grouped into

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.980 
basically the guns are grouped into
different<00:01:32.130> sections<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.150> set<00:01:33.390> off<00:01:33.570> at

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
different sections and are set off at

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
different sections and are set off at
different<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:34.799> intervals<00:01:34.829> by<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> timer

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
different time intervals by the timer

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.240 
different time intervals by the timer
blocks<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.110> means<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.829> some

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
blocks this means that you have some

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
blocks this means that you have some
time<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> adjust<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.420> shooting<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:39.960> your

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
time to adjust for shooting at your

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
time to adjust for shooting at your
enemy<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.590> continually<00:01:41.430> hitting<00:01:41.579> them<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
enemy and continually hitting them for a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
enemy and continually hitting them for a
short<00:01:42.479> duration<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.049> time<00:01:43.290> before<00:01:43.590> having<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
short duration of time before having to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
short duration of time before having to

two<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:24.870> fighting<00:02:25.290> against<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.100> my

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
two of them fighting against one of my

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.950 
two of them fighting against one of my
large<00:02:26.430> carriers<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.330> pretty<00:02:27.690> cool-looking

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
large carriers it's pretty cool-looking

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.890 
large carriers it's pretty cool-looking
but<00:02:28.950> sadly<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.580> probably<00:02:30.090> quite<00:02:30.300> obvious<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
but sadly and probably quite obvious to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
but sadly and probably quite obvious to
you<00:02:31.170> guys<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.190> carrier<00:02:32.670> didn't<00:02:33.000> stand<00:02:33.270> much

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
you guys the carrier didn't stand much

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120 
you guys the carrier didn't stand much
of<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.690> chance<00:02:33.720> without<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.470> complement<00:02:35.040> of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
of a chance without a complement of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.760 
of a chance without a complement of
fighters<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.790> defend<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:37.230> basically

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
fighters to defend it so it basically

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.160 
fighters to defend it so it basically
turned<00:02:38.010> into<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.400> kill<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> carrier<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
turned into a kill the carrier and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
turned into a kill the carrier and
carrier<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.100> nothing<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.520> try<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.790> run

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
carrier can do nothing but try to run

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.880 
carrier can do nothing but try to run
away<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> ramp<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.080> doesn't<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.680> any

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
away a ramp but that doesn't make it any

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:57.210 
away a ramp but that doesn't make it any
less<00:02:44.010> entertain

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.860 

yes<00:02:58.220> oh<00:02:58.400> my<00:02:58.430> ship<00:02:58.730> defenses<00:02:59.270> weren't<00:02:59.540> working

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
so well at this point I was trying to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.960 
so well at this point I was trying to
bring<00:03:12.170> my<00:03:12.440> front<00:03:12.800> cannons<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.460> bear<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.880> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.780 
bring my front cannons to bear on the
target<00:03:14.330> in<00:03:14.420> front<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.720> me<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.280> wasn't

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
target in front of me but it wasn't

target in front of me but it wasn't
working<00:03:16.910> out<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.330> well<00:03:24.040> eventually<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
working out so well eventually I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.850 
working out so well eventually I
realized<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.600> was<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.750> lost<00:03:27.110> battle<00:03:27.440> for

realized that it was a lost battle for
me<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.280> decided<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.330> try<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.990> escape<00:03:30.620> or<00:03:30.890> maybe

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370
