00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
leaves and you're going to see a few

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.899 
leaves and you're going to see a few
extra<00:01:46.080> little<00:01:46.260> leaves<00:01:46.650> here<00:01:47.010> those<00:01:47.700> are

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
extra little leaves here those are

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
extra little leaves here those are
actually<00:01:48.479> plants<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> well<00:01:50.190> they're

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
actually plants that are well they're

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.410 
actually plants that are well they're
not<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.520> plants<00:01:50.940> they're<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.270> less

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
not really plants they're more or less

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
not really plants they're more or less
side<00:01:51.720> shoots<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:53.010> like<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> tomato<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.060> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
side shoots and much like a tomato it it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.500 
side shoots and much like a tomato it it
acts<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.140> its<00:01:55.530> own<00:01:55.799> plant<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:57.119> part<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
acts as its own plant and it's part of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.820 
acts as its own plant and it's part of
what's<00:01:57.780> considered<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.590> mother

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
what's considered you know the mother

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.330 
what's considered you know the mother
plant<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.720> they<00:02:00.720> form<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.650> crack

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
plant here and they form in the crack

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.710 
plant here and they form in the crack
between<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.970> leaf<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.890> main<00:02:05.070> stem<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.299> you

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
between a leaf and the main stem so you

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.589 
between a leaf and the main stem so you
have<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.170> growing<00:02:07.710> stem<00:02:08.549> here<00:02:08.789> coming<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
have a growing stem here coming up and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720 
have a growing stem here coming up and
the<00:02:10.259> growing<00:02:10.470> stem<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> sky

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the growing stem is going up to the sky

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
the growing stem is going up to the sky
and<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:13.920> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and what we like to do is we like to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.520 
and what we like to do is we like to
prune<00:02:14.370> our<00:02:14.640> our<00:02:15.000> basil<00:02:15.900> plants<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.409> our

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
prune our our basil plants and our

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.800 
prune our our basil plants and our
pepper<00:02:16.739> plants<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:17.909> have<00:02:18.150> three

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
pepper plants when they have three

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
pepper plants when they have three
leaves<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.639> your<00:02:21.060> first<00:02:21.659> set<00:02:21.959> of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
leaves so you have your first set of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.089 
leaves so you have your first set of
seed<00:02:23.370> leaves<00:02:23.609> those<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.810> count<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.379> like<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
seed leaves those don't count I like to

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.630 
seed leaves those don't count I like to
count

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
count

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.880 
count
soon<00:02:26.819> as<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:27.300> three<00:02:27.630> sets<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.260> adult

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
soon as you have three sets of adult

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
soon as you have three sets of adult
leaves<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.370> there's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.610> difference<00:02:30.060> because

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
leaves so there's a difference because

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.699 
leaves so there's a difference because
what<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.930> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.440> want<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.590> make

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
what we want to do is you want to make

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.260 
what we want to do is you want to make
sure<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> plant<00:02:32.340> has<00:02:32.490> enough<00:02:32.790> energy

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
sure that the plant has enough energy

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990 
sure that the plant has enough energy
being<00:02:33.510> created<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.500> plant<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.459> justify

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
being created in the plant to justify

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
being created in the plant to justify
taking<00:02:36.480> away<00:02:36.690> some<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.380> their<00:02:37.620> energy<00:02:37.800> because

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
taking away some of their energy because

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.610 
taking away some of their energy because
the<00:02:38.819> leaves<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.480> actually<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:40.170> produces

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the leaves are actually what produces

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620 
the leaves are actually what produces
the<00:02:40.680> energy<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.490> plant<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.450> have

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the energy for the plant so you have

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.160 
the energy for the plant so you have
your<00:02:43.110> first<00:02:43.440> set<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:44.480> leaves<00:02:45.480> here<00:02:45.810> these<00:02:45.990> are

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
your first set of leaves here these are

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.199 
your first set of leaves here these are
the<00:02:46.200> first<00:02:46.470> set<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> adult<00:02:46.950> leaves<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:48.060> have

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the first set of adult leaves you have

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.660 
the first set of adult leaves you have
the<00:02:48.360> second<00:02:48.810> set<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.260> adult<00:02:49.470> leaves<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the second set of adult leaves and you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.940 
the second set of adult leaves and you
have<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.090> third<00:02:51.600> set<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.140> adult<00:02:52.410> leaves<00:02:52.620> so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
have the third set of adult leaves so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.320 
have the third set of adult leaves so
this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.220> right<00:02:53.430> when<00:02:53.580> we<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.910> prune<00:02:54.180> them

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
this is right when we like to prune them

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.630 
this is right when we like to prune them
so<00:02:55.020> I'm<00:02:55.110> not<00:02:55.230> doing<00:02:55.530> anything<00:02:55.739> too<00:02:56.130> early<00:02:56.520> or

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so I'm not doing anything too early or

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.000 
so I'm not doing anything too early or
too<00:02:56.670> late<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.959> perfect<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.680> how<00:02:58.830> they're

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
too late this is perfect see how they're

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.740 
too late this is perfect see how they're
just<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.489> starting<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.880> come<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.120> that's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
just now starting to come out that's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.300 
just now starting to come out that's
fine<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:01.290> enough<00:03:01.470> that's<00:03:01.920> enough<00:03:02.070> to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
fine that's enough that's enough to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.040 
fine that's enough that's enough to
consider<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.730> three<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.750> what<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.930> like

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
consider it three and then what we like

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.400 
consider it three and then what we like
to<00:03:04.080> do<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:05.280> will<00:03:05.489> come<00:03:05.880> under<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.410> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
to do is we will come under here and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.830 
to do is we will come under here and
we'll<00:03:07.590> take<00:03:07.800> our<00:03:07.980> scissors<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.510> try<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.780> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
we'll take our scissors and try not to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.860 
we'll take our scissors and try not to
block<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.480> come<00:03:12.690> in

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
block you here and we like to come in

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.820 
block you here and we like to come in
and<00:03:13.019> we<00:03:13.769> like<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.920> prune<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:15.030> here<00:03:15.989> right

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
and we like to prune right here right

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.110 
and we like to prune right here right
below<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:18.090> second<00:03:18.720> set<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.850> leaves

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
below the second set of leaves

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.930 
below the second set of leaves
so<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.110> prune<00:03:22.380> those<00:03:22.500> off<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.670> know<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:23.820> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
so you prune those off you know what you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.020 
so you prune those off you know what you
have<00:03:24.090> here<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.959> second<00:03:25.560> set<00:03:25.709> of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
have here is you have the second set of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.140 
have here is you have the second set of
adult<00:03:27.030> leaves<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.850> third<00:03:29.850> set

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
adult leaves and you have the third set

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.970 
adult leaves and you have the third set
of<00:03:30.180> adult<00:03:30.570> leaves<00:03:30.720> detached<00:03:31.440> from<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.739> plant

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
of adult leaves detached from the plant

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.810 
of adult leaves detached from the plant
and<00:03:32.970> what<00:03:33.299> you're<00:03:33.420> left<00:03:33.600> with<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.430> first

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
and what you're left with is the first

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.840 
and what you're left with is the first
set<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> adult<00:03:36.570> leaves<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> seed<00:03:38.610> leaves

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
set of adult leaves and the seed leaves

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.130 
set of adult leaves and the seed leaves
here<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:40.130> basically<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.250> main<00:03:41.579> growing<00:03:41.820> stem

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
here and a basically a main growing stem

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.120 
here and a basically a main growing stem
however<00:03:43.140> what's<00:03:43.380> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.590> happen<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.100> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
however what's going to happen is that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.910 
however what's going to happen is that
the<00:03:44.400> main<00:03:44.549> growing<00:03:44.790> stem<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.299> right<00:03:45.989> here<00:03:46.230> it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the main growing stem is right here it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.000 
the main growing stem is right here it
is<00:03:46.980> no<00:03:47.340> longer<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:48.090> main<00:03:48.660> growing<00:03:48.959> stem<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.500> is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
is no longer a main growing stem it is

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.490 
is no longer a main growing stem it is
in<00:03:50.130> fact<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.549> dead<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.630> what's<00:03:52.260> going<00:03:52.440> to

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
in fact a dead end and what's going to

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.900 
in fact a dead end and what's going to
happen<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.890> these<00:03:53.100> leaves<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.579> are<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.820> to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
happen is these leaves here are going to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.520 
happen is these leaves here are going to
produce<00:03:54.060> energy<00:03:54.390> they're<00:03:55.079> going<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> continue

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
produce energy they're going to continue

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.830 
produce energy they're going to continue
producing<00:03:55.829> energy<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.489> these<00:03:57.360> other<00:03:57.540> little

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
producing energy and these other little

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.640 
producing energy and these other little
leave<00:03:57.959> they're<00:03:58.110> going<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.290> produce<00:03:58.410> energy

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
leave they're going to produce energy

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.979 
leave they're going to produce energy
and<00:03:59.100> what's<00:03:59.880> going<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.090> happen<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> energy

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
and what's going to happen is the energy

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.160 
and what's going to happen is the energy
is<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.829> be<00:04:02.459> formed<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:03.180> leaves<00:04:03.540> it's

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
is going to be formed in leaves it's

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.810 
is going to be formed in leaves it's
going<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.410> go<00:04:04.530> through<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.829> plant<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.310> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
going to go through the plant and the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.400 
going to go through the plant and the
plant<00:04:05.940> always<00:04:06.360> likes<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.600> grow<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.930> an<00:04:06.989> upward

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
plant always likes to grow in an upward

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.470 
plant always likes to grow in an upward
pattern<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.070> always<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.790> always<00:04:09.090> will<00:04:09.360> grow

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
pattern and always it always will grow

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.840 
pattern and always it always will grow
in<00:04:09.600> an<00:04:09.690> upward<00:04:09.989> pattern<00:04:10.380> because<00:04:11.130> that's<00:04:11.579> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
in an upward pattern because that's the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.270 
in an upward pattern because that's the
way<00:04:11.940> leafing<00:04:12.360> growth<00:04:12.630> happens<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.739> up<00:04:13.890> it

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
way leafing growth happens is just up it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.729 
way leafing growth happens is just up it
happens<00:04:14.540> towards<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.720> light<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
happens towards the light it's just a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.770 
happens towards the light it's just a
natural<00:04:16.919> occurrence<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:18.150> what<00:04:18.299> happens<00:04:18.600> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
natural occurrence and what happens the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.330 
natural occurrence and what happens the
energy<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.470> say<00:04:19.650> okay<00:04:19.950> let's<00:04:20.190> start

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
energy is going to say okay let's start

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.979 
energy is going to say okay let's start
growing<00:04:20.669> up<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.299> going<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.479> hit<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.720> dead

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
growing up it's going to hit this dead

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.580 
growing up it's going to hit this dead
end<00:04:22.140> here

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
end here

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.760 
end here
that<00:04:23.250> dead<00:04:23.520> end<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:24.030> not<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.200> grow

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
that dead end is not going to grow

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.620 
that dead end is not going to grow
obviously<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.970> know<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.120> won't<00:04:27.330> see<00:04:27.510> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
obviously it you know you won't see the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.360 
obviously it you know you won't see the
the<00:04:27.930> stick<00:04:28.289> just<00:04:28.590> growing<00:04:28.890> up<00:04:28.979> higher<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
the stick just growing up higher and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.279 
the stick just growing up higher and
higher<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:30.180> going<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.539> need<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.810> find<00:04:30.960> some

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
higher it's going to need to find some

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.350 
higher it's going to need to find some
other<00:04:31.440> way<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.680> push<00:04:32.100> its<00:04:32.280> growth<00:04:32.550> so<00:04:33.210> what

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
other way to push its growth so what

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.320 
other way to push its growth so what
it'll<00:04:33.479> do<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.530> will<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.460> know<00:04:35.729> just<00:04:36.120> like

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
it'll do is it will you know just like

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.779 
it'll do is it will you know just like
you<00:04:36.660> get<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.260> d2<00:04:37.680> or<00:04:37.710> if<00:04:38.039> there's<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.340> dead<00:04:38.580> end

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
you get on a d2 or if there's a dead end

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:39.340 
you get on a d2 or if there's a dead end
or

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
or

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.290 
or
construction<00:04:40.040> let's<00:04:40.850> pretend<00:04:41.150> there's

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
construction let's pretend there's

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.030 
construction let's pretend there's
construction<00:04:41.570> at<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:41.990> top<00:04:42.200> here<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:42.890> going

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
construction at the top here it's going

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.870 
construction at the top here it's going
to<00:04:43.100> say<00:04:43.160> okay<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.610> find<00:04:43.790> an

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
to say okay I have to find an

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.700 
to say okay I have to find an
alternative<00:04:44.720> route<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.200> get<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.470> where<00:04:45.590> I'm

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
alternative route to get to where I'm

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.680 
alternative route to get to where I'm
going<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.070> it's<00:04:46.370> going<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:46.700> go<00:04:46.820> through<00:04:47.120> these

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
going so it's going to go through these

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.710 
going so it's going to go through these
little<00:04:48.560> leafing<00:04:49.040> joints<00:04:49.550> here<00:04:49.790> where<00:04:50.540> they

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
little leafing joints here where they

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.010 
little leafing joints here where they
already<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.200> tiny<00:04:51.590> little<00:04:52.480> tiny<00:04:53.480> little<00:04:53.750> new

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
already have tiny little tiny little new

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.650 
already have tiny little tiny little new
growing<00:04:54.320> points<00:04:55.070> started<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.150> they're

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
growing points started and they're

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.360 
growing points started and they're
actually<00:04:56.930> going<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.140> start<00:04:57.320> growing<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.830> whole

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
actually going to start growing a whole

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.240 
actually going to start growing a whole
new<00:04:58.750> whole<00:04:59.750> new<00:04:59.780> growing<00:05:00.320> point<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.800> that's

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
new whole new growing point and that's

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.890 
new whole new growing point and that's
going<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.850> then<00:05:02.000> grow<00:05:02.090> up<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.420> way<00:05:02.600> and<00:05:02.630> this

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
going to then grow up that way and this

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.440 
going to then grow up that way and this
is<00:05:02.960> going<00:05:03.230> to<00:05:03.350> grow<00:05:03.410> up<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.740> way<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:04.450> and

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
is going to grow up that way and and

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.760 
is going to grow up that way and and
then<00:05:05.870> what's<00:05:06.020> going<00:05:06.170> to<00:05:06.230> happen<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.590> you<00:05:06.650> can

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
then what's going to happen is you can

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.350 
then what's going to happen is you can
actually<00:05:06.920> prune<00:05:07.280> those<00:05:07.520> later<00:05:07.850> on<00:05:07.940> as<00:05:08.180> well

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
actually prune those later on as well

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.820 
actually prune those later on as well
and<00:05:08.930> what<00:05:09.020> that's<00:05:09.200> going<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.410> do<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.590> going<00:05:09.740> to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
and what that's going to do is going to

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.640 
and what that's going to do is going to
produce<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.340> very<00:05:10.670> bushy<00:05:11.060> plant<00:05:11.480> that<00:05:11.900> is<00:05:12.020> has<00:05:12.620> a

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
produce a very bushy plant that is has a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.400 
produce a very bushy plant that is has a
low<00:05:12.920> center<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.280> gravity<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.910> now<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:14.840> twice

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
low center of gravity so now it is twice

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.560 
low center of gravity so now it is twice
as<00:05:15.440> sturdy<00:05:15.950> as<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:16.400> was<00:05:16.550> before<00:05:17.030> we<00:05:17.210> pruned<00:05:17.480> it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
as sturdy as it was before we pruned it

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.230 
as sturdy as it was before we pruned it
even<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:17.960> it's<00:05:18.440> going<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.770> really<00:05:19.610> push<00:05:20.000> all

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
even and it's going to really push all

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.650 
even and it's going to really push all
the<00:05:20.510> weight<00:05:20.660> at<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:21.290> very<00:05:21.740> very<00:05:22.280> low<00:05:22.430> point<00:05:22.910> near

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
the weight at a very very low point near

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.020 
the weight at a very very low point near
the<00:05:23.690> soil<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.560> when<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.800> wind<00:05:24.980> blows<00:05:25.190> this<00:05:25.790> is

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
the soil so when the wind blows this is

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.020 
the soil so when the wind blows this is
not<00:05:26.390> going<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.870> do<00:05:27.140> anything<00:05:27.680> but<00:05:28.460> just<00:05:28.520> taunt

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
not going to do anything but just taunt

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.870 
not going to do anything but just taunt
that<00:05:29.300> strong<00:05:29.840> wind<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.380> that<00:05:30.860> rain<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.400> it's

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
that strong wind and that rain and it's

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.190 
that strong wind and that rain and it's
going<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:32.150> be<00:05:32.300> strong<00:05:32.630> for<00:05:32.660> you<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.020> going<00:05:33.110> to

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
going to be strong for you it's going to

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.200 
going to be strong for you it's going to
produce<00:05:33.320> even<00:05:33.920> more<00:05:34.160> because<00:05:34.700> now<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:34.970> have

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
produce even more because now you have

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.840 
produce even more because now you have
two<00:05:35.540> men<00:05:35.750> growing<00:05:36.020> points<00:05:36.530> instead<00:05:36.920> of<00:05:37.040> one<00:05:37.370> so

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
two men growing points instead of one so

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.250 
two men growing points instead of one so
it's<00:05:37.970> going<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.150> produce<00:05:38.270> double<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.870> basil

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
it's going to produce double the basil

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.110 
it's going to produce double the basil
you<00:05:40.040> prune<00:05:40.340> those<00:05:40.490> it's<00:05:40.730> going<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:40.910> produce

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
you prune those it's going to produce

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.390 
you prune those it's going to produce
triple<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.020> basil<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.590> got<00:05:43.040> I'm<00:05:43.130> saying

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
triple the basil and you got I'm saying

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.040 
triple the basil and you got I'm saying
it's<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.730> multiplication<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.630> fact<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.960> will

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
it's a multiplication of fact it will

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.860 
it's a multiplication of fact it will
just<00:05:45.200> keep<00:05:45.470> producing<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:47.450> it<00:05:47.810> will

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
just keep producing and and it will

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.960 
just keep producing and and it will
produce<00:05:48.050> all<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.740> time<00:05:48.920> until<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.340> frost<00:05:49.640> and

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
produce all the time until the frost and

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.050 
produce all the time until the frost and
it<00:05:50.420> will<00:05:50.540> produce<00:05:50.720> well<00:05:51.080> for<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.060> that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
it will produce well for you and that

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.400 
it will produce well for you and that
way<00:05:53.150> you<00:05:53.210> can<00:05:53.390> actually<00:05:53.690> feed<00:05:53.900> a<00:05:53.930> whole<00:05:54.140> family

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
way you can actually feed a whole family

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.620 
way you can actually feed a whole family
with<00:05:54.710> just<00:05:54.890> one<00:05:55.040> basil<00:05:55.220> plant<00:05:55.700> and<00:05:55.910> that<00:05:56.360> is

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
with just one basil plant and that is

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.570 
with just one basil plant and that is
pretty<00:05:57.140> awesome<00:05:57.230> even<00:05:58.130> though<00:05:58.220> we<00:05:58.340> typically

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
pretty awesome even though we typically

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.250 
pretty awesome even though we typically
grow<00:05:58.790> more<00:05:58.970> than<00:05:59.000> one<00:05:59.270> it's<00:05:59.720> a<00:05:59.780> good<00:05:59.960> thing<00:06:00.140> to

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
grow more than one it's a good thing to

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.140 
grow more than one it's a good thing to
know<00:06:00.320> so<00:06:00.620> good<00:06:00.710> it's<00:06:00.980> a<00:06:01.100> good<00:06:01.310> feeling<00:06:01.610> that

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
know so good it's a good feeling that

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.610 
know so good it's a good feeling that
you<00:06:02.210> can<00:06:02.420> feed<00:06:02.750> your<00:06:02.780> entire<00:06:02.990> family<00:06:03.500> with

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
you can feed your entire family with

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.520 
you can feed your entire family with
just<00:06:03.800> one<00:06:03.980> plant<00:06:04.390> so<00:06:05.390> there<00:06:05.570> you<00:06:05.690> go<00:06:05.900> hopefully

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
just one plant so there you go hopefully

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.350 
just one plant so there you go hopefully
that<00:06:06.680> method<00:06:07.070> serves<00:06:07.460> you<00:06:07.730> well<00:06:07.940> hopefully

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
that method serves you well hopefully

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.750 
that method serves you well hopefully
we'll<00:06:08.870> give<00:06:09.020> it<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.230> try<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:09.860> let<00:06:09.920> me<00:06:10.430> know<00:06:10.550> in

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
we'll give it a try and let me know in

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.400 
we'll give it a try and let me know in
the<00:06:10.790> comments<00:06:11.210> box<00:06:11.360> below<00:06:11.690> if<00:06:11.810> you<00:06:11.840> decide<00:06:12.290> to

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
try this method or have tried this

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.760 
try this method or have tried this
method<00:06:14.210> in<00:06:14.480> the<00:06:14.570> past<00:06:14.840> like<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:15.470> said<00:06:15.650> I've<00:06:15.710> been

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
method in the past like I said I've been

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.140 
method in the past like I said I've been
doing<00:06:15.830> this<00:06:16.070> for<00:06:16.400> probably<00:06:16.640> three<00:06:17.000> or<00:06:17.030> four

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
doing this for probably three or four

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.060 
doing this for probably three or four
years<00:06:17.540> like<00:06:17.780> this<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.320> I<00:06:18.410> have<00:06:18.530> never<00:06:18.860> had

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
years like this and I have never had

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.640 
years like this and I have never had
anything<00:06:19.250> happen<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:20.330> was<00:06:20.570> not<00:06:21.080> actually<00:06:21.620> a

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
anything happen that was not actually a

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.080 
anything happen that was not actually a
better<00:06:22.250> benefit<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.480> the<00:06:23.600> plant<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:24.080> to<00:06:24.440> me<00:06:24.650> so

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
better benefit to the plant and to me so

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.520 
better benefit to the plant and to me so
you<00:06:26.090> know<00:06:26.210> hey<00:06:26.390> it's<00:06:26.810> one<00:06:27.020> of<00:06:27.110> those<00:06:27.170> things

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
you know hey it's one of those things

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.550 
you know hey it's one of those things
that<00:06:27.920> sometimes<00:06:28.310> we<00:06:29.060> don't<00:06:29.210> like<00:06:29.660> to<00:06:30.170> butcher

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
that sometimes we don't like to butcher

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.890 
that sometimes we don't like to butcher
a<00:06:30.620> plant<00:06:30.920> because<00:06:31.700> if<00:06:32.030> you<00:06:32.300> only<00:06:32.420> have<00:06:32.630> three

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
a plant because if you only have three

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.570 
a plant because if you only have three
leaves<00:06:33.170> and<00:06:33.380> you<00:06:33.440> take<00:06:33.650> off<00:06:33.860> two-thirds<00:06:34.430> of

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
leaves and you take off two-thirds of

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.970 
leaves and you take off two-thirds of
the<00:06:34.670> plant<00:06:34.910> it<00:06:35.360> can<00:06:35.510> be<00:06:35.630> like<00:06:35.870> what<00:06:36.170> what<00:06:36.860> the

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
the plant it can be like what what the

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.260 
the plant it can be like what what the
heck<00:06:37.160> you<00:06:37.340> know<00:06:37.370> I'm<00:06:37.520> killing<00:06:37.940> this<00:06:38.030> poor

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
heck you know I'm killing this poor

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.630 
heck you know I'm killing this poor
thing<00:06:38.540> but<00:06:38.990> trust<00:06:39.290> me<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:40.040> results<00:06:40.490> will<00:06:40.610> be

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
thing but trust me the results will be
