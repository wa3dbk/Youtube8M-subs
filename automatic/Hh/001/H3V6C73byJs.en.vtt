00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
and the medications won't necessarily

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.320 
and the medications won't necessarily
heal<00:01:30.860> these<00:01:31.130> also<00:01:31.430> then<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.880> end<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.180> having

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
heal these also then you end up having

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.440 
heal these also then you end up having
the<00:01:32.990> revision<00:01:33.470> surgery<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.160> there<00:01:35.060> are<00:01:35.180> no

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the revision surgery and there are no

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.760 
the revision surgery and there are no
point<00:01:35.810> higher<00:01:36.710> risk<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.250> complications<00:01:37.660> and

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
point higher risk of complications and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.410 
point higher risk of complications and
that<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.190> necessarily<00:01:40.670> always<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.210> final

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that is not necessarily always the final

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.880 
that is not necessarily always the final
solution<00:01:41.990> either<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.500> all<00:01:42.620> straight

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
solution either you can all straight

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.140 
solution either you can all straight
again<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:43.640> no<00:01:44.270> smoking<00:01:44.960> active<00:01:45.830> or<00:01:46.160> passive<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
again so no smoking active or passive so

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.850 
again so no smoking active or passive so
if<00:01:47.240> families<00:01:47.750> smoke<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.590> ask<00:01:48.710> what

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
if families smoke you have to ask what

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.250 
if families smoke you have to ask what
to<00:01:48.980> smoke<00:01:49.190> outside<00:01:49.460> if<00:01:50.240> you're<00:01:50.510> smoking<00:01:51.110> you

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
to smoke outside if you're smoking you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.110 
to smoke outside if you're smoking you
shouldn't<00:01:51.650> be<00:01:51.710> doing<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.610> really<00:01:52.910> stay

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
shouldn't be doing it and really stay

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.790 
shouldn't be doing it and really stay
off<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.480> for<00:01:53.660> good<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.560> Health

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
off of it for good and this is a Health

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.170 
off of it for good and this is a Health
Initiative<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.490> there's<00:01:55.700> nothing<00:01:55.940> more

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
Initiative so there's nothing more

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
important as a Health Initiative than

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.690 
important as a Health Initiative than
