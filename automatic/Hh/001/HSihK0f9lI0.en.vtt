seen that time before we'll probably
right<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> hadn't<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
right but I hadn't so that the thing is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
right but I hadn't so that the thing is
that<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.290> many<00:01:55.439> youtubers<00:01:56.040> out

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that there are so many youtubers out

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.980 
that there are so many youtubers out
there<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.880> community<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.719> big

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
there and if the community is so big

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
there and if the community is so big
that<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.649> pretty<00:01:58.979> much<00:01:59.159> impossible<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.850> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that it's pretty much impossible to be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
that it's pretty much impossible to be
the<00:02:00.030> absolute<00:02:00.299> first<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.469> far<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.710> asking

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.950 
because I believe that that tag will
scale<00:02:30.220> down<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.850> he<00:02:30.940> won't<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
scale down and he won't just be for the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.410 
scale down and he won't just be for the
max<00:02:32.170> bases<00:02:32.620> attacking<00:02:33.070> other<00:02:34.030> motivated

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
max bases attacking other motivated
