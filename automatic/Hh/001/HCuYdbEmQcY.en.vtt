00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.220
 and how do we see this with gameplay playing 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.290
 on the map chest all against all 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.700
 they know that I do not have those life things 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 so I play at home for just 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 show the new maps and have a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.130
 bottom line and well it's just 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 a background job to tell them about 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.740
 something that seems pretty 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 interesting that I want you to me 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 will like to do with playstation 4 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 and with that one 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.029
 he is the one kinect 2 that are the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
 cameras the movement sensors that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.109
 will come that will have the new consoles 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.400
 so well then this first one that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.410
 normally it will not go much into 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 technical workshops I will not go much 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 that what the cameras have in them 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 we can say that both things that both 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 cameras reproduce or record high 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.670
 resolution the beach king 2 has a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 1080p resolution data transfers 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.059
 2 gb per second is quite powerful in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.219
 reality and microsoft has invested 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 quite in this new camera and in 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.930
 reinforce the errors he had fix 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 the mistakes that 501 and the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.989
 precision 4 there is therefore a resolution 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.520
 of 1280 x 800 runs to 600 years and is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.859
 pretty decent is much better than 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.690
 playstation eye 1 but the truth is that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.189
 it's not as powerful or as good as 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.710
 which 2 in both power and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.680
 resolution and that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.909
 then this in let's say that in 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.560
 general functions both cameras 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.299
 will work as great for recording and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 play to record video for the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.920
 video calls to take pictures in the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 xbox one and in which precision 4 and 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.380
 also both cameras will have detector 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.909
 of movement and voice so therefore the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.320
 kinect 2 will obviously be better at this 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.270
 since microsoft has invested enough 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880
 in this technology both in decline of 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.860
 movement as in voice detector but 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 upside down motion sensor sensor 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.970
 of voice because this has improved a lot 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.920
 research of this technology and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.619
 practically the camera life looks want 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.300
 well up to say your heart rate you 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.520
 let's say I can see your body 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.070
 complete in a fairly accurate way 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 and pretty fluid and the precision 4 there 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.119
 because we know it has been said also 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.429
 you can apart from locating the command and 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.679
 will use all motion controls 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.360
 of 2 or 4 as he precision a lot for 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.909
 the control of the movement has also been 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280
 said that we can say that take this 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.069
 be able to grab the body like a sensor 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.450
 of movement and this because we do not know that 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.160
 also happen no tests have been done 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.690
 but we already know that playstation 4 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.700
 There you can do it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 as for voice command it can be 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.340
 you have two know that it's practically your 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.540
 strong is that of the gloves it will be understood 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 command we see everywhere and it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 will perform any ect go rushing 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.460
 It must always be connected to the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.530
 john AIFOS for the console to function 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.390
 you can pause it, let's say 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.160
 to put to sleep for a certain time 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.990
 but you can not turn off as such 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.270
 disconnect because they are going to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.740
 need to work and then the 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.420
 commands evolves pretty good and the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.800
 esbo and precision 4 do not know how 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.050
 will have the voice commands with him has 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.820
 as with precision 4 there are and has not 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.010
 said nothing like that at least 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.570
 to date but if you can use the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.310
 precision 4 there you can register the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.930
 voice of the people and then possibly 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 performs certain functions although we have 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.790
 to see later now things 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.140
 positive that you have it 2 ends with 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.820
 the console and by the way this is the reason 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.680
 why he left it costing more than the 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.450
 playstation 4 because it comes with it 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.830
 has two and they are being and doing it is 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.180
 more expensive and many people would say that 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.520
 I'd prefer it was not so you end up 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.780
 without the camera and that the playstation that 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.910
 cost the same here prison 4 and that 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.770
 convert more but the thing is that 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.360
 microsoft has built that of their van in 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.980
 base to work perfectly with 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.750
 kinect and that you come along with the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.380
 console and it has a halo and it has a side 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.660
 very positive 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.310
 if the console always tensioned all 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.370
 one always have connectivity that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.170
 all players will have a kinect to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.700
 I swear or is necessarily with one of 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.110
 jos one and this means that the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.460
 developments of the developers 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140
 can create functions in games 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.030
 anything that from the earns for 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.680
 those one for the camera knowing that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.960
 all goals will have things like 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 example in a call of duty game this 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.890
 if you want to do any function 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.570
 specific I do not know for example call a 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.240
 Ray simply says so to whom 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.650
 in two the developers play 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.880
 can do those functions in the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.320
 games because they know that all 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 players have two who in their 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.170
 spouse one thing they can not do 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.730
 full are four because nothing 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.500
 ensures that all players of 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.840
 price when they have a playstation 4 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.920
 there is a pretty negative thing and you 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.920
 gives a good pro to the playstation xbox one 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.840
 kinect because ok is more expensive and it comes 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.270
 with the console and then but it will have its 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.520
 positive sides that are these things and 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.830
 also wake up those one kinect also 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.810
 can we say that detect the 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.730
 people in the dark this one has more 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.410
 functions to detect movements 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.910
 of the legs and arms too 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.130
 can read the qr codes to put 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.470
 any type of card immediately 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.300
 write the card code this 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.640
 One thing that you gave me and intrigues me is 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.770
 What would happen if you damage those two 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.630
 what would happen if I know if it wet it if it exists 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.980
 damage and if you fall a height if you 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.320
 you break and you take it from the trip what 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.850
 you put in the suitcase and 7 damage whatever 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.440
 what happened had those who because microsoft 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.580
 has said that he who in the exclusion 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.740
 will work better with him has to 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.000
 practically functions that are useless 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.010
 in these good if you do not have here you see me 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.540
 turned on then at least part 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.370
 are and we know that the camera will cost 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.990
 around 50 60 dollars and that is 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.850
 purchase as a separate elevator that if you 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.160
 it hurts us because we buy another one and we know 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.810
 that but when he has something else if 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.490
 we were damaged possibly more than 100 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.960
 dollars and microsoft has not given details 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.750
 of that and now now I wonder how 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.010
 It will be that good guys think that you 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.650
 it looks like this on the cameras of 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.760
 precise 410 les beaux one kinect that 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.630
 think about this decision that you take 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.010
 taste 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.570
 microsoft to include the camera the 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.280
 console and the extra functions that we 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.480
 bring but nothing guys do not forget 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.830
 ride this video check some three 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.960
 videos that shows at the end and nothing 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.960
 plus vote number 7 video until next
