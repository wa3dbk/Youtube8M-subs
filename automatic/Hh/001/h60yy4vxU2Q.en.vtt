00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.819 
the other glitz and glam going on it's
also<00:00:36.510> important<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> note<00:00:37.200> 8<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
also important to note 8 that this is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.459 
also important to note 8 that this is
pre<00:00:38.100> alpha<00:00:38.370> footage<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:40.020> properly

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
pre alpha footage and it's not properly

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
pre alpha footage and it's not properly
optimized<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.280> performance<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.210> have

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
optimized for performance so they have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.940 
optimized for performance so they have
to<00:00:42.420> compensate<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.260> pretty<00:00:43.559> crazy

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
to compensate with some pretty crazy

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
to compensate with some pretty crazy

Hardware on top of putting on that
pretty<00:00:46.710> dog<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> pony<00:00:47.399> show<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pretty dog and pony show as the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
pretty dog and pony show as the
developers<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.530> clean<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.770> their

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
developers go in and clean up their

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.029 
developers go in and clean up their
coding<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.579> tidy<00:00:50.760> things<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.600> gain

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
coding and tidy things up they will gain

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.910 
coding and tidy things up they will gain
FPS<00:00:53.039> left<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.379> beast<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
FPS left and right so this beast is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
FPS left and right so this beast is
definitely<00:00:56.370> overkill<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.539> needed<00:00:58.109> at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
definitely overkill but it's needed at

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.779 
definitely overkill but it's needed at
this<00:00:58.379> point<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.309> everything

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
this point because they have everything

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
this point because they have everything
cranked<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.510> high<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> what's<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> chance

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
cranked on high and what's the chance

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.000 
cranked on high and what's the chance
that<00:01:02.129> those<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.760> 1440p<00:01:03.660> monitors<00:01:04.320> even

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
that those are 1440p monitors even

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.910 
that those are 1440p monitors even
higher<00:01:05.189> resolution<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.630> pixels<00:01:07.049> even

higher resolution even more pixels even

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
higher resolution even more pixels even
more<00:01:08.189> pretty<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.880> how<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.630> internal

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
more pretty and how about an internal

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.000 
more pretty and how about an internal
