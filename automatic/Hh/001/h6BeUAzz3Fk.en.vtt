00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
in her scars I think they are I'm just a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
in her scars I think they are I'm just a
little<00:04:45.690> my<00:04:45.990> white<00:04:46.350> cream<00:04:46.680> makeup<00:04:46.710> which<00:04:47.190> I've

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
little my white cream makeup which I've

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.400 
little my white cream makeup which I've
used<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.610> thousand<00:04:48.150> times<00:04:48.419> in<00:04:48.600> my<00:04:48.630> videos<00:04:48.720> so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
used a thousand times in my videos so

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.990 
used a thousand times in my videos so
you<00:04:49.500> must<00:04:49.770> know<00:04:49.950> which<00:04:50.040> one<00:04:50.190> it's<00:04:50.520> just<00:04:50.700> in<00:04:50.880> a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
you must know which one it's just in a

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.640 
you must know which one it's just in a
tube<00:04:51.240> it's<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:51.750> white<00:04:52.139> fittest<00:04:52.470> him

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
tube it's just white fittest him

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.890 
tube it's just white fittest him
basically<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:53.820> went<00:04:53.970> in<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.300> drew<00:04:54.600> an

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
basically so I went in and drew an

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.230 
basically so I went in and drew an
eyebrow<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.800> way<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:55.980> did<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:56.760> followed

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
eyebrow the way I did it was I followed

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.240 
eyebrow the way I did it was I followed
the<00:04:57.570> start<00:04:58.230> of<00:04:58.410> my<00:04:58.590> eyebrow<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:58.980> then

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
the start of my eyebrow and then

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.920 
the start of my eyebrow and then
actually<00:04:59.639> crushed<00:04:59.940> through<00:05:00.270> halfway<00:05:00.540> and

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
actually crushed through halfway and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.450 
actually crushed through halfway and
then<00:05:01.139> extended<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.830> forever<00:05:02.130> down<00:05:02.250> because

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
then extended it forever down because

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.310 
then extended it forever down because
hairs<00:05:02.639> are<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:02.790> lot<00:05:02.940> longer<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.600> skinnier<00:05:04.110> I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
hairs are a lot longer and skinnier I

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.070 
hairs are a lot longer and skinnier I
did<00:05:05.250> try<00:05:05.460> block<00:05:05.669> my<00:05:05.820> eyebrows<00:05:06.120> out<00:05:06.360> as<00:05:06.600> much<00:05:06.900> as

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
did try block my eyebrows out as much as

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.620 
did try block my eyebrows out as much as
I<00:05:07.139> could<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.620> did<00:05:07.770> my<00:05:07.889> best<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.360> just

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
I could I did my best and then I just

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.530 
I could I did my best and then I just
drew<00:05:09.990> these<00:05:10.169> sort<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.680> like<00:05:10.890> googly<00:05:11.430> things<00:05:12.090> I

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
drew these sort of like googly things I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.810 
drew these sort of like googly things I
did<00:05:13.380> look<00:05:13.710> at<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.890> reference<00:05:14.100> photo<00:05:14.400> that's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
did look at a reference photo that's

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.740 
did look at a reference photo that's
what<00:05:14.940> I'm<00:05:15.000> looking<00:05:15.210> at<00:05:15.300> when<00:05:15.419> I'm<00:05:15.540> looking

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
what I'm looking at when I'm looking

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.500 
what I'm looking at when I'm looking
down<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:17.250> get<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:18.000> sort<00:05:18.210> of<00:05:18.270> shape

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
down and to get the sort of shape

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.180 
down and to get the sort of shape
they're<00:05:19.020> not<00:05:19.260> exactly<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.740> same<00:05:19.919> on<00:05:20.040> both

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
they're not exactly the same on both

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.710 
they're not exactly the same on both
sides<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.330> doesn't<00:05:21.810> have<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.200> perfect

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
sides so it doesn't have to be perfect

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.630 
sides so it doesn't have to be perfect
but<00:05:24.720> yes<00:05:25.110> this<00:05:25.590> bit<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:25.919> just<00:05:25.950> need<00:05:26.610> a

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
but yes this bit you just need a

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.550 
but yes this bit you just need a
reference<00:05:26.970> for<00:05:27.210> because<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.169> bit<00:05:28.320> hard<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
reference for because it's a bit hard to

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.770 
reference for because it's a bit hard to
explain<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:29.220> ships<00:05:29.460> just<00:05:29.850> look<00:05:30.419> up<00:05:30.540> a<00:05:30.600> foot

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
explain the ships just look up a foot

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.440 
explain the ships just look up a foot
online<00:05:31.200> it's<00:05:31.860> doing<00:05:32.400> our<00:05:32.520> hard<00:05:32.790> fine<00:05:33.090> but

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
online it's doing our hard fine but

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.020 
online it's doing our hard fine but
you'll<00:05:33.990> find<00:05:34.229> one<00:05:34.380> eventually<00:05:34.669> she<00:05:35.669> also<00:05:35.850> has

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
you'll find one eventually she also has

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.600 
you'll find one eventually she also has
two<00:05:36.330> scars<00:05:36.690> on<00:05:36.960> her<00:05:37.169> forehead<00:05:37.500> one<00:05:38.130> was<00:05:38.400> more

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
of a round earth ship and then one was

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.909 
of a round earth ship and then one was
more<00:05:41.610> where<00:05:41.820> I'd<00:05:42.060> say<00:05:42.300> a<00:05:42.330> t-shirt<00:05:43.050> like<00:05:43.890> a

for<00:05:58.080> several<00:05:58.560> different<00:05:58.800> photos<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.669> and<00:05:59.850> I

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
for several different photos of it and I

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.270 
for several different photos of it and I
couldn't<00:06:00.150> see<00:06:00.390> it<00:06:00.539> so<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:01.140> just<00:06:01.650> sort<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.220> made

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
couldn't see it so I just sort of made

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.430 
couldn't see it so I just sort of made
up<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.910> sheer<00:06:03.150> it's<00:06:03.990> sort<00:06:04.260> of<00:06:04.289> like<00:06:04.380> a

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
up the sheer it's sort of like a

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.540 
up the sheer it's sort of like a
rectangle<00:06:05.220> but<00:06:05.370> not<00:06:05.580> closed<00:06:05.880> at<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.330> end<00:06:06.360> and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
rectangle but not closed at the end and

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.060 
rectangle but not closed at the end and
then<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:09.210> drew<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.900> top<00:06:10.140> line<00:06:10.350> a<00:06:10.380> bit<00:06:10.650> too<00:06:10.830> long

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
then I drew the top line a bit too long

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.060 
then I drew the top line a bit too long
so<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.700> do<00:06:11.850> just<00:06:12.810> much<00:06:12.990> this<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:13.320> bit<00:06:13.560> more<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:13.979> the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
so I do just much this a bit more so the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.920 
so I do just much this a bit more so the
bottom<00:06:14.430> line<00:06:14.640> it<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:14.910> longer<00:06:15.240> than<00:06:15.539> the<00:06:15.690> top

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
bottom line it is longer than the top

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.440 
bottom line it is longer than the top
and<00:06:16.169> then<00:06:16.289> curves<00:06:16.530> around<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:18.060> will<00:06:18.210> see<00:06:18.330> this

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
and then curves around you will see this

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.820 
and then curves around you will see this
in<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.660> moment

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.970 

and<00:06:22.700> then<00:06:22.910> it<00:06:23.210> to<00:06:23.540> make<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:24.020> back<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.380> blue<00:06:24.620> color

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
and then it to make it back a blue color

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.520 
and then it to make it back a blue color
I<00:06:25.190> went<00:06:25.580> ahead<00:06:25.670> it<00:06:25.910> with<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.060> shimmery<00:06:26.600> light<00:06:27.230> to

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
I went ahead it with a shimmery light to

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.590 
I went ahead it with a shimmery light to
blue<00:06:27.740> teal<00:06:28.070> color<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.640> just<00:06:28.790> apply<00:06:29.120> this<00:06:29.180> over

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600

the top of the white the white was just
there<00:06:31.610> as<00:06:31.880> a<00:06:31.910> base<00:06:32.240> to<00:06:32.480> help<00:06:32.630> the<00:06:32.780> blue<00:06:32.960> that
