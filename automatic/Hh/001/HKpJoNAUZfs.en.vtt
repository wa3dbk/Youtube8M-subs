should pour that time and energy into
our<00:02:16.160> development<00:02:16.519> efforts<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.390> eventually<00:02:17.660> we

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
our development efforts so eventually we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.990 
our development efforts so eventually we
can<00:02:18.290> encourage<00:02:18.590> third-party<00:02:19.310> publishers<00:02:19.459> to

price<00:02:22.400> cut<00:02:22.610> would<00:02:22.819> probably<00:02:23.300> help<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.720> Wii<00:02:23.840> U

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
price cut would probably help the Wii U

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.720 
price cut would probably help the Wii U
but<00:02:24.349> they<00:02:24.500> said<00:02:24.769> that's<00:02:24.890> very<00:02:25.310> unlikely

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
but they said that's very unlikely

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.360 
but they said that's very unlikely
because<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.420> not<00:02:26.900> an<00:02:27.110> easy<00:02:27.290> option<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:28.069> take

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
because it's not an easy option to take

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.670 
because it's not an easy option to take
and<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.569> for<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.840> week<00:02:29.900> everyone<00:02:30.440> I'm
