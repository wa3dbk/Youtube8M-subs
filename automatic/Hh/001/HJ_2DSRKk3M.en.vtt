00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.170 
trailer when we saw again here which is
the<00:04:16.820> car<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.390> from<00:04:17.690> building<00:04:18.140> to<00:04:18.170> building

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the car going from building to building

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.320 
the car going from building to building
I<00:04:20.350> am<00:04:21.350> really<00:04:21.980> excited<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.730> this<00:04:23.000> film

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
I am really excited for this film

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.830 
I am really excited for this film
because<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:26.210> looks<00:04:26.510> like<00:04:26.630> it's<00:04:26.780> just

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
because it's it looks like it's just

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.330 
because it's it looks like it's just
gonna<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.200> ridiculous<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:27.920> like<00:04:28.190> I've<00:04:28.310> said

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
gonna be ridiculous and like I've said

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.430 
gonna be ridiculous and like I've said
before<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:28.850> I'll<00:04:29.030> repeat<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.420> once<00:04:29.690> more<00:04:29.810> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
before and I'll repeat it once more the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.620 
before and I'll repeat it once more the
third<00:04:30.710> time<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.610> Paul<00:04:31.820> Walker<00:04:32.090> thing<00:04:32.420> is

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
third time the Paul Walker thing is

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.020 
third time the Paul Walker thing is
really<00:04:32.920> interesting<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:34.460> me<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.730> how<00:04:34.850> they're

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
really interesting to me of how they're

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.050 
really interesting to me of how they're
gonna<00:04:35.120> handle<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.790> looks<00:04:37.790> insane

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
gonna handle that but this looks insane

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.950 
gonna handle that but this looks insane
because<00:04:38.870> they're<00:04:39.260> pushing<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.770> limits<00:04:40.130> and

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
because they're pushing the limits and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.660 
because they're pushing the limits and
they're<00:04:41.960> quoting<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.440> has<00:04:42.560> one<00:04:42.860> last<00:04:43.100> ride<00:04:43.370> but

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
they're quoting it has one last ride but

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.310 
they're quoting it has one last ride but
we<00:04:43.700> know<00:04:43.910> there<00:04:44.060> should<00:04:44.210> be<00:04:44.300> more<00:04:44.510> possibly

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
we know there should be more possibly

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.160 
we know there should be more possibly
but<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:46.010> is<00:04:46.220> definitely<00:04:46.990> look<00:04:47.990> like<00:04:48.080> it's

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
but this is definitely look like it's

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.540 
but this is definitely look like it's
gonna<00:04:48.260> be<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.470> lot<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.710> fun<00:04:49.070> what<00:04:49.280> do<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:49.430> guys

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
gonna be a lot of fun what do you guys

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.100 
gonna be a lot of fun what do you guys
