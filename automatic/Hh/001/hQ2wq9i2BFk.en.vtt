00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
like it gets right behind you up walls

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.380 
like it gets right behind you up walls
and<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.860> speed<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.430> game<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:15.910> captured

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
and the speed of the game is captured

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.870 
and the speed of the game is captured
very<00:03:16.630> well<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:17.650> as<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.950> get<00:03:18.130> shut<00:03:18.670> off

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
very well and then as you get shut off

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.750 
very well and then as you get shut off
on<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> loop<00:03:19.690> or<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> ramp<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:21.070> know<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.550> takes

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
on to a loop or a ramp you know it takes

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.700 
on to a loop or a ramp you know it takes
that<00:03:21.940> side<00:03:22.300> approach<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.990> expands<00:03:23.410> out<00:03:23.680> a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
that side approach and expands out a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.410 
that side approach and expands out a
little<00:03:23.920> bit<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.910> think<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.300> adds

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
little bit and it really I think it adds

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.970 
little bit and it really I think it adds
a<00:03:25.510> nice<00:03:25.630> touch<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.200> game<00:03:26.380> just<00:03:26.710> like<00:03:26.860> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
a nice touch to the game just like the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.720 
a nice touch to the game just like the
classics<00:03:27.400> game<00:03:27.640> exactly<00:03:28.150> exactly<00:03:29.020> and<00:03:29.500> yeah<00:03:30.250> I

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
thought I was watching a movie I thought

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.620 
thought I was watching a movie I thought
I<00:04:36.460> was<00:04:36.610> watching<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.970> movie<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.330> they<00:04:37.450> did<00:04:37.600> a

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
I was watching a movie so they did a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.020 
I was watching a movie so they did a
fantastic<00:04:37.810> job<00:04:38.260> there<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.070> menu<00:04:39.430> music<00:04:39.580> is

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
fantastic job there the menu music is

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.690 
fantastic job there the menu music is
fantastic<00:04:40.600> but<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:41.680> only<00:04:41.800> they<00:04:42.040> spent<00:04:42.460> as<00:04:42.550> much

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
fantastic but if only they spent as much

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.040 
fantastic but if only they spent as much
time<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.120> sound<00:04:43.360> as<00:04:43.480> they<00:04:43.600> did<00:04:43.780> with<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
time in the sound as they did with the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.010 
time in the sound as they did with the
