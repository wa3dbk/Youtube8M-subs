00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
is the little kind of rectangular box up
here<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.289> will<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.859> when<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> click

this okay so I'm gonna take this way
down<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> effect

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
down and just so we can see the effect

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
down and just so we can see the effect
happening<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.630> click<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.079> drag<00:00:34.500> down

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you're gonna see that basically I got

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.290 
you're gonna see that basically I got
three<00:00:36.960> lines<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.710> bottom<00:00:38.040> line<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
three lines the bottom line here is that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
three lines the bottom line here is that
none<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> effect<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.710> happening<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.340> I

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
none of the effect is happening so I

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.630 
none of the effect is happening so I
have<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.540> -<00:00:43.200> 3.38<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.550> my

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
have this going down - 3.38 on my

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.660 
have this going down - 3.38 on my
exposure<00:00:45.000> from<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.230> nuts<00:00:47.129> not<00:00:47.370> taking

exposure from here down nuts not taking

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
exposure from here down nuts not taking
effect<00:00:47.969> from<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> taking<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
effect from here up it's taking a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
effect from here up it's taking a
hundred<00:00:49.890> percent<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.370> effect<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> then

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
hundred percent of that effect and then

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
hundred percent of that effect and then
from<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> line<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> line<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> from

from this line to this line we have from
0<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> 100<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.780> gradually<00:00:55.710> takes<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
0 to 100 it gradually takes on that

graduated filter the graduated filter
when<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> use<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.119> now<00:01:30.270> before<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> was

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
when I use it now before I was

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
when I use it now before I was
restricted<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> basically<00:01:32.520> doing<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.939> lines

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
restricted to basically doing in lines

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.499 
restricted to basically doing in lines
or<00:01:33.720> diagonals<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.240> how

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
or diagonals or you know you know how

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.890 
or diagonals or you know you know how
basically<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.630> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
basically and that kind of have to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
basically and that kind of have to
follow<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.740> pattern<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:42.240> now

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
follow that that pattern there but now

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.330 
follow that that pattern there but now
with<00:01:42.840> Lightroom<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.220> option

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
with Lightroom I actually have an option

with Lightroom I actually have an option
called<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> brush<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.329> click<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
called a brush and I can click on that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
called a brush and I can click on that
and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> hold<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.280> option<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.000> can

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and then I can hold down option I can

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
and then I can hold down option I can
see<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.840> +<00:01:49.320> cursor<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.950> changing<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> -

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
see that my + cursor is changing to a -

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090 
see that my + cursor is changing to a -
meaning<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:51.570> subtracting<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
meaning that I'm now subtracting that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700 
meaning that I'm now subtracting that
effect<00:01:53.520> okay<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> come<00:01:55.020> down<00:01:55.049> here<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
effect okay so if I come down here I can

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
effect okay so if I come down here I can
I<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> basically<00:01:56.219> turn<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.729> my<00:01:56.939> flow<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
I can basically turn on my flow which is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
I can basically turn on my flow which is
the<00:01:58.799> amount<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.729> gonna<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> affect

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the amount that I'm gonna have it affect

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.209 
the amount that I'm gonna have it affect
and<00:02:00.840> then<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.710> come<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and then I can just come in here and I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980 
and then I can just come in here and I
can<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.460> paint<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.000> back<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.719> say<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
can just paint this back and say you

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
can just paint this back and say you
know<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
know what I really do like that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
know what I really do like that
graduated<00:02:06.090> filter<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> clouds

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
graduated filter in the in the clouds

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
graduated filter in the in the clouds
but<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> didn't<00:02:08.340> mean<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> actually

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
but I didn't mean for it to actually

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.210 
but I didn't mean for it to actually
take<00:02:09.420> effect<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> mountain<00:02:10.920> range

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
take effect here on this mountain range

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.350 
take effect here on this mountain range
or<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:11.819> trees<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
or in these trees and I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.270 
or in these trees and I
to<00:02:13.570> show<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.900> area<00:02:14.230> off<00:02:14.440> maybe<00:02:14.860> even<00:02:15.160> these

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
to show that area off maybe even these

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.700 
to show that area off maybe even these
ones<00:02:15.490> over<00:02:15.610> here<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.260> really<00:02:17.560> want

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
ones over here so now if I really want

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.140 
ones over here so now if I really want
to<00:02:17.800> get<00:02:17.860> specific<00:02:18.310> I'm<00:02:18.430> gonna<00:02:18.550> zoom<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.120> my

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
to get specific I'm gonna zoom in on my

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
to get specific I'm gonna zoom in on my
image<00:02:19.510> I'm<00:02:20.050> actually<00:02:20.290> gonna<00:02:20.500> go<00:02:20.770> right<00:02:21.130> along

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
image I'm actually gonna go right along

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.650 
image I'm actually gonna go right along
that<00:02:21.520> edge<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.940> make<00:02:22.060> sure<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.210> don't<00:02:22.330> get<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that edge to make sure I don't get that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.750 
that edge to make sure I don't get that
halo<00:02:23.080> effect<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:24.400> on<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.990> see

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
halo effect going on but you can see

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.430 
halo effect going on but you can see
just<00:02:27.760> kind<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.940> before<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.450> after<00:02:28.810> now<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.140> can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
just kind of before and after now I can

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.840 
just kind of before and after now I can
use<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.590> graduated<00:02:30.190> filter<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.730> can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
use that graduated filter and I can

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.480 
use that graduated filter and I can
really<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.270> back<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.450> actually<00:02:31.960> just<00:02:32.560> get

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
really go back and actually just get

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.070 
really go back and actually just get
more<00:02:33.730> detailed<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.780> choose

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
more detailed and actually choose

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.540 
more detailed and actually choose
specifically<00:02:35.710> where<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.890> want<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.370> happen

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
specifically where I want that to happen

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.820 
specifically where I want that to happen
now<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.570> not<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.350> graduated<00:02:38.800> filter

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
now it's not just a graduated filter

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.350 
now it's not just a graduated filter
though<00:02:39.160> that's<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> beauty<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.209> can

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
though that's the beauty of it I can

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
though that's the beauty of it I can
actually<00:02:40.540> come<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.080> now<00:02:41.230> let's<00:02:42.160> just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
actually come in here now let's just

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
actually come in here now let's just
choose<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.640> image<00:02:42.940> here<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.959> use<00:02:44.140> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
choose this image here and I can use the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.620 
choose this image here and I can use the
radial<00:02:44.860> filter<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.550> same<00:02:45.730> exact<00:02:46.120> way<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.390> I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
radial filter the same exact way so I

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.420 
radial filter the same exact way so I
can<00:02:46.780> take<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.990> radial<00:02:47.290> filter<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.250> can

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
can take the radial filter and I can

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.430 
can take the radial filter and I can
basically<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.450> know<00:02:49.570> let's<00:02:50.200> say<00:02:50.350> I'm

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
basically you know let's say I'm

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
basically you know let's say I'm
applying<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.100> effect<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> whole<00:02:51.880> thing

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
applying that effect to the whole thing

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.930 
applying that effect to the whole thing
there<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.450> now<00:02:53.140> let's<00:02:54.040> go<00:02:54.190> back<00:02:54.370> let's<00:02:54.700> choose

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
there and now let's go back let's choose

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.720 
there and now let's go back let's choose
that<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:55.300> pin<00:02:55.510> choose<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.380> brush<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.010> now

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
that little pin choose the brush and now

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.120 
that little pin choose the brush and now
with<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> brush<00:02:58.420> take<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.200> -<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.800> let's<00:02:59.980> say

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
with the brush take that - and let's say

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.370 
with the brush take that - and let's say
I<00:03:00.190> want<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.489> bring<00:03:00.700> make<00:03:01.570> my<00:03:01.690> curser<00:03:02.080> bigger
