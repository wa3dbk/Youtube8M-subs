00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.790
 but none the less 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.080
 those moments that we had as in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.250
 defense and attack 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 many tried to play limit 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 concentrated 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.830
 Overall I think we deserved 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 but the moment created this victory can 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.670
 be you tell me what has changed we 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.949
 playing football 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 go out you see how we play football and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 you determine to judge what can 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640
 change in the team all the same 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.530
 of need journalists and experts in order 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 to look at what's going on 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 the team how to change the game like 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.309
 the game itself is changing and why is it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.510
 happens and we do our thing every 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 day at every example learn football 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.520
 played to play and need to know 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 how to play football 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.730
 when the team knows how to play she 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.120
 plays and when she doesn't know I 'm glad she 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 definitely neuro 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 this is a goal and relax and there will be time 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 the time is right we will be preparing 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 Prepare unconditionally for each game as 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.770
 the very last 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 I will not even think about it and even 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.840
 I will not look who will get us all 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.250
 will fall still have a strong team 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.380
 playing strong teams will cost more 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.020
 weaker still have to play more 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.670
 weak team does not matter respect 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.420
 you need any opponent and tune 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 not on the one with whom you play to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.510
 go out and show your game and be 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 ready for this game first 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.360
 today I think psychologically 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 we are somewhere not finalized yet 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.400
 but again it's good that it's over 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.910
 last three games 20 league europe 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.440
 I think 15 whose group stage is good 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.270
 know indicator 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.040
 it is hard for him to be sure that he is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.520
 hard he lacks experience he is not 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.990
 enough 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.070
 it may be certain but it comes out 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.250
 on the football field and even more so today 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.470
 remote control in it specifically won more 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.570
 I consider the right flanks teams 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.970
 rivals so whole i think that he 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 in their task more or less managed 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.550
 he has a lot of good potential 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.520
 maybe grow into a great player 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.850
 need time need confidence and we are in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.320
 This will help and I think that everything is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:30.150
 his hand is a hard game and there was a lot 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.600
 moments and we and they have a good thing 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.500
 Sanya with Zhukovsky help out is about luck 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 and still endured my moments later 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.070
 have implemented 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:50.530
 I do not know me hard because 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.639
 cool class I will repeat that we endured 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.579
 knew that there would be 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:59.060
 the moment it will need to implement them so 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.200
 and it happened well, probably if I start everything 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.159
 narrate 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.219
 thats it will take a very long time 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:10.310
 changed quite a lot and I personally 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:14.439
 glad you are with us now 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.469
 where should be sergey sidorchuk well 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.600
 I saw that I opened the hara transmission 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.050
 so thin 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.250
 well done you just had to score yourself 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.500
 answered your question 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.590
 championship in first place in the world of Europe 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.319
 for 1 ms 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.110
 everything is fine of course there is something 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.830
 work because somewhere in probably 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.830
 defense leaves much to be desired but 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.890
 just as if with a new coach 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.950
 half a year has passed and probably already 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.220
 the next 40 we will be playing on 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.530
 my other schemes and pay more 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 attention and defense because today 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.260
 there were really many moments 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.239
 teams not not called moments in this 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.060
 the game lizu implement the following work 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.890
 over this can not happen so what if 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.310
 and the attacker implemented the percent method 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.829
 Iâ€™ll probably repeat my moments 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.930
 and wouldn't even really appreciate it so rudely 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.670
 saying happens yes there is something not somewhere not 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.400
 lucky where it did not work out but the main thing 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.859
 what we won is the main thing yet 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.389
 congratulated on victory and wished to undress 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.039
 well rested wave come back without 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.039
 injuries without any diseases transferred
