00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 it would be a hell of paladins who allowed 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.660
 to stack is just ridiculous and the amount 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.090

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.280
 shortly after the video was 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.980
 Blizzard released immediately fixed a bug and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 stacks became limited to five 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.920

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.999
 and fixed it with the release of the cataclysm 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.579
 if I'm not mistaken in the shopping district 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.799

 jumped off the wall by fell through 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.119
 by stormgrad at that time it was 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.279
 popular tank because people need something 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.649
 was engaged in stormgrading and author 

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:30.880
 correctly said this tank was removed with

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.849
 mail 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.249
 but besides them there was this gear 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:51.159
 which could kill all opponents in 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.899
 a radius of 30 meters she fell into the hands of 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.060
 player with nickname karate chop 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.509
 and and he used several times in 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.289
 lich raids a total of 14 times before 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.520
 so his 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.789
 and several other accounts 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.119
 Are banned for cheating number seven

 broadcasts ditch Heather was my favorite gods

 airport in old steelforge 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 during the time of vanilla Ilyich, of course, in our 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.330
 days this zone is available as an initial 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.489
 quest for dwarves and gnomes but in those 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.980
 times you had a special way 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.590
 climb the wall in a special place block 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.870
 madani and on a special path through the mountains without 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.330
 textural areas getting there 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.610
 as soon as you turned up there 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.880
 what happened could be described only 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.799
 in two words a complete mess 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.230
 some fashions beat the fires of the teacher 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.870
 it is not clear what jumped out of nowhere 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 a bunch of planes taking off and constantly 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.480
 spawning trolls fighting with dwarves 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.340
 and so theories suggest that this is a zone in 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 the original was planned as starting 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.380
 for gnomes and if specifically the top alfiya 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.239
 there was a lot of space for quests zone 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.970
 was next to the mountain and there was 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.769
 enough trolls for pumping of course 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.170
 it could be just arbitrary 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.329
 decorative masterpiece developers but 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.500
 we will never know 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.760
 number six incidents of damaged blood 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.819
 unintended biological attack 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.859
 bosses akara ice guru bo raid players 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.139
 get infected gets debuff 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.470
 and then spread the infection in 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.060
 capitals that instantly killed 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.519
 low-level characters and from other 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.829
 gradually sucked health disease 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.630
 quickly spread throughout Azeroth 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.690
 and blizzard urgently had to release 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.569
 the patch that stopped her idea so much 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.609
 It was like the most real that her 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.549
 the consequences studied real 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.290
 epidemiologists number five death grip 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.329
 across azerot 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.030
 right after the wrath of the lich king 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.400
 I found a kind of flaw 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.709
 if the death knight was on the ship 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.959
 in the pirate bay and pulled the player not 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.419
 standing on him then draw him 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.280
 the player has ejected straight south 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.780
 through altar hidden windows 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.910
 ship developers 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.130
 later developed 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.870
 checks said they simply forgot 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.750
 remove his number four 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.370
 early battlefield 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.830
 long ago it was possible to go through 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.450
 the gate before the start of the battle on such a field 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.820
 combat as nizina arati 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.739
 and start capturing flags were also rumored 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.230
 what can get out beyond 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.390
 Alterac Valley 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.400
 players were banned for it because 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.070
 witnesses balunova and respectively 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.200
 report or such players constantly I 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.750
 also tried to go beyond the textures 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.510
 but not for dishonest pvp but only for 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.700
 world exploration number three stone ice 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.290
 this tank melted away was in an early version 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.930
 the wrath of the lich king 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.180
 1 emotions just flooded global 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.790
 chat stone ice melted stone and ice 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.740
 melted blizzard had to sweat over 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.810
 finding out the reasons and this bug 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.700
 and ended up on in the fiery quest 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.530
 Solstice where you had to put 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.500
 hand on this stone to urge 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.450
 Lieutenant cold mind of course obviously 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.320
 that the mistake was simply made 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.780
 developing 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.510
 I myself remember tons of these messages in the chat 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.220
 but only by creating this video I found out 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.740
 reason number two 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.660
 there is no cheese and you and bombs during the race for 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.660
 murder of the lich king in heroic 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.450
 insyde guild mode I got 72 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.130
 Hour bank lost achievements and loot for 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.500
 using sara isn't that you chrome 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.390
 who installed platforms during 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.580
 of this battle the fact is they were 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.690
 absolutely no clue what these bombs are on 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.090
 so capable 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.780
 one of the robbers used them with his 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.640
 rotation 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.620
 but no one understood why the platform 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.480
 recovered and only rejoiced 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.940
 this blizzard was punished anyway 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.880
 guild and soon fixed a bug and number 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.490
 one island game master technically this 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.950
 not a bug peculiar easter eggs from the early 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.080
 versions of the game on this island were held 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.000
 time is a game master somewhere after him 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.310
 should have appeared and left the game 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.919
 but also there deep underground there 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.440
 interrogation room where you teleport 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.630
 and masters for questioning about dishonest 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.910
 action in the game get to the island 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.430
 players could only by using spaces in 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.919
 game mechanics but since then the world 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.849
 island security have become more serious and get 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.490
 there is no longer always possible 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:15.399
 and we have it all translated and 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.399
 sounded by the portal mn.ru
