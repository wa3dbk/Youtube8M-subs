00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello Narita video version 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.920
 I want to create a music cd using the windows media player this time 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.660
 I think 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.060
 windows media player originally entered windows personal computer 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.560
 Is a music player 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.000
 So again 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.030
 There is no need to install new software 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.150
 You can now create a music cd 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:41.820
 Also this time there is no way to copy the music cd 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:50.010
 Music files originally stored on the computer 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:56.850
 Organize various kinds of music using music files such as mp3 and wmp 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.850
 I would like to create my own original music cd 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 Let's actually create a music cd 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 First of all 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:15.770
 Like this, I'm creating a folder called music cd right now 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.720
 But like this, I have a folder with my favorite music 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 Please create it like this and think that it would be more convenient to have you this time 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.900
 It is only 3 songs using sample music 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.080
 About 700 mb cd r 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.580
 I think I can store 156 songs 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:41.020
 Please try it 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.470
