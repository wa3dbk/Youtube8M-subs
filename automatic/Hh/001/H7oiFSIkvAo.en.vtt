00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.420
 welcome subscribers and viewers of my 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.330
 channel with you again fox and today we 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 We continue the series of tests of the original 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.420
 army ballistic points on their 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.010
 bullets sustainability in the first video was 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.410
 testing points from the forest of the most 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 common protective rifle 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 points a reference to this test I will 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 bottom under video in description 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 Today we will talk about how to 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.320
 the lens has managed to test the glasses 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.129
 also no less famous and popular from 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.129
 with land abs 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 It is wider 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 frankly big face shield on 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.350
 eyes we shot at it from 12 gauge 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.030
 at a distance of 10 meters 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 holders such as felt characteristics 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:13.190
 you see here and also shot at 100 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.190
 meters of small-caliber rifles amount 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.930
 as a result of testing that we 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.480
 got traces of the fraction 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.230
 from the cartridge 12 gauge as you see this 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.490
 small rash 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.130
 that is, nothing significant no 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.370
 significant damage to the lens 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.940
 didn't even get the depth 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.700
 But these holes are but not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:00.630
 more than one tenth of a millimeter with they 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.470
 very small just given for their 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.750
 quite deep scratches but porridge 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.660
 same course at its 100 meters distance 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.170
 made of them he decides somewhere to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:19.440
 non penetration did not work end to end but in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:24.240
 the rest of the fragments from the bullet passed on 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.520
 departure here for example went bullets on 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.530
 tangent here here is a complete break through 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.480
 failed but it also depended on 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 that the glasses were attached to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.340
 metal pipe and to the center if 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.050
 it turned out to punch and since the back 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.220
 there was a steady support then if the bullets 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.500
 got to the edge 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.930
 plastic springs and respectively bullet 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.209
 bounced well as bounced either by 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 tangent either she failed to 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.440
 end punch filter 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.120
 Yes, I would like a separate thank you 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.130
 say hedgehog egor thanks for 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.940
 lenses provided filters like you 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:20.870
 promised waiting for glasses firm locus on 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.870
 trials see how they show themselves 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.590
 one thing to look at the test 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.470
 commercials another thing of course 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.250
 try it yourself well 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.070
 given the opportunity 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.180
 I hope this video was interesting if 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:40.130
 will any questions ask 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.130
 Thank you all for your attention and bye bye
