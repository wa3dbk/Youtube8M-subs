especially in really cold weather
because<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.829> woven<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.370> tightly<00:00:47.930> it's<00:00:48.930> hard

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you can think ahead to the other side is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can think ahead to the other side is
that<00:01:50.180> all<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.539> even<00:01:51.990> stitches<00:01:52.289> on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> other

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that all the even stitches on the other

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
that all the even stitches on the other
side<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.399> pearled<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> obligee

side will be pearled and all the obligee

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.830 
side will be pearled and all the obligee
slip<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.229> it'll<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.649> hard<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.840> confused

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
slip so it'll be hard to get confused

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.529 
slip so it'll be hard to get confused
and<00:01:58.079> mess<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:59.280> stitches<00:01:59.700> could<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> slip

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
and mess up what stitches could be slip

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.749 
and mess up what stitches could be slip
should<00:02:00.929> be<00:02:01.049> slipped<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> think

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
should be slipped because if you think

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
should be slipped because if you think
about<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.079> need<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> slip<00:02:04.619> something

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
about it if you need to slip something

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
about it if you need to slip something
and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> slip<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.280> again<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.509> next

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and then you slip it again on the next

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.509 
and then you slip it again on the next
round<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.280> gonna<00:02:11.760> turn<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.300> because

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
round it's not gonna turn out because

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.860 
round it's not gonna turn out because
you'll<00:02:14.519> keep<00:02:14.760> slipping<00:02:15.269> stitches<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.750> not

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you'll keep slipping stitches and not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
you'll keep slipping stitches and not
working<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.040> it'll<00:02:17.160> almost<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.580> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
working them so it'll almost be like a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.000 
working them so it'll almost be like a
