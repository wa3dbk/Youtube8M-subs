worn and worn down but also get an idea

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110 
worn and worn down but also get an idea
of<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.110> rear<00:03:01.290> foot<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.650> forefoot<00:03:02.070> ratio<00:03:02.459> what

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
of the rear foot to forefoot ratio what

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.820 
of the rear foot to forefoot ratio what
that<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.630> how<00:03:03.810> far<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
that is is how far and what the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.470 
that is is how far and what the
thicknesses<00:03:05.340> between<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.850> rear<00:03:06.000> foot<00:03:06.239> lifts

and<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.230> forefoot<00:03:07.709> lifts<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.640> most<00:03:08.940> shoes

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
and the forefoot lifts now most shoes

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.690

most<00:03:11.160> shoes<00:03:11.459> are<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.770> know<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.220> point<00:03:14.400> five

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
most shoes are you know one point five

most shoes are you know one point five
to<00:03:15.450> one<00:03:15.630> ratio<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:17.070> example<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.670> one

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.680 
to one ratio so for example a one to one
ratio<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.739> rear<00:03:19.920> foot<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.239> forefoot

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
show you that and then what so once you

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.590 
show you that and then what so once you
break<00:04:31.320> in<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.860> mock<00:04:32.010> lock<00:04:32.250> with<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.150> felt

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.630 
break in the mock lock with the felt
liner<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.830> be<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.950> little<00:04:35.130> snug<00:04:35.400> at<00:04:35.550> the

liner it can be a little snug at the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.100 
liner it can be a little snug at the
beginning<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> should<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:36.690> as<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.930> start

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
beginning and it should but as you start

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.870 
beginning and it should but as you start
to<00:04:37.320> wear<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.100> moose<00:04:38.250> hide<00:04:38.430> starts<00:04:38.760> to

to wear it the the moose hide starts to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.760 
to wear it the the moose hide starts to
give<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.060> little<00:04:39.330> bit<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:40.050> felt<00:04:40.290> starts<00:04:40.620> to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
give a little bit and the felt starts to

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.680 
give a little bit and the felt starts to
give<00:04:40.920> a<00:04:40.950> little<00:04:41.130> bit<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.550> that's<00:04:41.970> normal<00:04:42.570> you

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
give a little bit and that's normal you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.150 
give a little bit and that's normal you
want<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.200> some<00:04:43.440> movement<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:43.950> foot

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
want to have some movement of the foot

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.100 
want to have some movement of the foot
in<00:04:44.280> there<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.490> create<00:04:44.760> an<00:04:44.850> air<00:04:45.000> barrier<00:04:45.330> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
in there to create an air barrier to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.010 
in there to create an air barrier to
maintain<00:04:47.010> some<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> warm<00:04:47.610> air<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.840> can

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
maintain some of the warm air you can

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.020 
maintain some of the warm air you can
wear<00:04:49.140> these<00:04:49.290> things<00:04:49.470> barefoot<00:04:50.010> but<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.580> think

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
wear these things barefoot but I think

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.550 
wear these things barefoot but I think
the<00:04:51.180> company<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.750> certainly<00:04:52.110> do<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.380> well

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
the company and I certainly do as well

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.790 
the company and I certainly do as well
recommend<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:54.110> because<00:04:55.110> these<00:04:55.290> things<00:04:55.530> are

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
recommend it because these things are

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.370 
recommend it because these things are
really<00:04:56.250> warm<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:56.880> once<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.690> gets<00:04:57.780> broken<00:04:58.110> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
really warm but once it gets broken and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.590 
really warm but once it gets broken and
then<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.680> add<00:04:58.770> another<00:04:58.800> 9<00:04:59.460> millimeter<00:05:00.060> on

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
then you can add another 9 millimeter on

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080 
then you can add another 9 millimeter on
top<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.230> 9<00:05:01.530> millimeter<00:05:02.100> sole<00:05:02.580> lift<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.030> it

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
top of this 9 millimeter sole lift so it

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.060 
top of this 9 millimeter sole lift so it
creates<00:05:03.360> an<00:05:03.450> insulation<00:05:04.170> bear<00:05:04.500> in<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.710> bottom

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
creates an insulation bear in the bottom

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.190 
creates an insulation bear in the bottom
of<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.250> foot<00:05:05.490> your<00:05:06.180> foot<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.600> not<00:05:06.750> gonna<00:05:06.990> get

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
of the foot your foot is not gonna get

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.510 
of the foot your foot is not gonna get
cold<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.650> here<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.950> mean<00:05:08.130> there's<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.340> reason

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
cold in here I mean there's a reason

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.850 
cold in here I mean there's a reason
these<00:05:08.730> things<00:05:08.790> have<00:05:09.060> been<00:05:09.090> used<00:05:09.750> on<00:05:09.930> Arctic

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
these things have been used on Arctic

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.130 
these things have been used on Arctic
expeditions<00:05:11.730> ok<00:05:12.120> they're<00:05:12.480> about<00:05:12.630> as<00:05:12.780> warm<00:05:12.930> as

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
expeditions ok they're about as warm as

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.140 
expeditions ok they're about as warm as
you<00:05:13.230> can<00:05:13.380> get<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.280> felt<00:05:14.520> liner<00:05:14.700> basically

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
you can get so this felt liner basically

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.270 
you can get so this felt liner basically
just<00:05:15.300> slides<00:05:15.540> inside<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.140> boot<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:17.160> I'll

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
just slides inside the boot and I'll

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.550 
just slides inside the boot and I'll
walk<00:05:17.490> up<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.850> camera<00:05:18.060> here<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.560> there's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
walk up to the camera here and there's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.840 
walk up to the camera here and there's
