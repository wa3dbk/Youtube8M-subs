the enemies come to you the best place
to<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.320> head<00:00:31.560> glitch<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
to do this is to head glitch the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
to do this is to head glitch the
platform<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.460> shoot<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.120> run<00:00:33.300> by

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
platform and shoot them as they run by

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
platform and shoot them as they run by
as<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.980> barely<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
as you can see they can barely see you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
as you can see they can barely see you
and<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> too<00:00:36.719> late<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.020> do

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and if they do it will be too late to do

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.959 
and if they do it will be too late to do
anything<00:00:37.380> about<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> another<00:00:38.399> great<00:00:38.579> spot<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
anything about it another great spot is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
anything about it another great spot is
sitting<00:00:39.210> behind<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> barrels<00:00:39.840> basically

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sitting behind the barrels basically

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
sitting behind the barrels basically
does<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> same<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.160> however<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.700> left

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
does the same thing however you are left

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.330 
does the same thing however you are left
a<00:00:42.090> little<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.420> exposed<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> enemies

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
a little more exposed to enemies

a little more exposed to enemies
switching<00:00:44.340> gears<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> left<00:00:44.969> side<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
switching gears to the left side it is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.880 
switching gears to the left side it is
important<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> stop<00:00:46.200> any<00:00:46.410> enemies<00:00:46.770> from

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
important to stop any enemies from

getting into the middle from the street

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.729 
getting into the middle from the street
this<00:00:48.660> may<00:00:48.809> prevent<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.320> getting<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this may prevent them from getting the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
this may prevent them from getting the
bomb<00:00:49.890> planted<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> beginning<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> the
