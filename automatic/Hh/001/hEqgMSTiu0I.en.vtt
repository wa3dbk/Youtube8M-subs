I guess the motivations come from not

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
I guess the motivations come from not
not<00:01:21.450> enjoying<00:01:21.750> cart<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> moment<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> don't

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
enjoy myself and I thought well might as
well<00:01:27.570> take<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> time<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:28.950> work<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
well take the time to do some work you

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
well take the time to do some work you
know<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> good<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.210> because

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
know it's a good time to do it because

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
know it's a good time to do it because
I've<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.409> more<00:01:31.439> week<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:31.920> I'm<00:01:32.009> on

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
I've got one more week and then I'm on

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
I've got one more week and then I'm on
Easter<00:01:32.400> break<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:32.909> weeks<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
Easter break for two weeks so it's

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.630 
Easter break for two weeks so it's
probably<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> good<00:01:34.680> time<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.460> as

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
probably a good time to get as much as

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
probably a good time to get as much as
long<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.000> while<00:01:36.570> everyone's<00:01:37.290> still

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
long as I can while everyone's still

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.170 
long as I can while everyone's still
around<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.250> everyone<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.970> home

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
around and then everyone does it go home

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.830 
around and then everyone does it go home
you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> families<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.950> stuff<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.400> I

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
you know to the families and stuff so I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
you know to the families and stuff so I
guess<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.049> enjoying<00:01:43.380> Car'das<00:01:43.829> motivated<00:01:44.340> me

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
guess not enjoying Car'das motivated me

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.359 
guess not enjoying Car'das motivated me
to<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.700> work<00:01:44.909> early<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> change<00:01:46.220> which<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to do work early for a change which is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.840 
to do work early for a change which is
good<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.450> guess<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.579> much<00:01:50.640> my

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
good I guess so that's pretty much my

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.830 
good I guess so that's pretty much my
plan<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> week<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.720> doing

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
plan for the week I'm going to be doing

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
plan for the week I'm going to be doing
that<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.680> love<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> may<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> MLG

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.370 
is going to take up a whole lot of my
time<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.689> reason<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:01.020> calling<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
time I think the reason I'm calling this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
time I think the reason I'm calling this
an<00:02:01.560> unhealthy<00:02:01.950> weekend<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.700> something<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
an unhealthy weekend or something like

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.060 
an unhealthy weekend or something like

that is because i'm just going to be

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.830 
that is because i'm just going to be
getting<00:02:05.250> takeaways<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.390> doing<00:02:06.509> work

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
know get it you know drive down or a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.420 
know get it you know drive down or a
quick<00:03:56.729> playing<00:03:57.120> over<00:03:57.479> he's<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.400> such<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
quick playing over he's just like such a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.360 
quick playing over he's just like such a
long<00:04:00.000> travel<00:04:00.359> costs<00:04:01.199> so<00:04:01.439> much<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.769> get<00:04:02.099> there

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
long travel costs so much to get there

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.270 
long travel costs so much to get there
to<00:04:03.090> stay<00:04:03.299> there<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.169> probably<00:04:04.620> pay<00:04:05.040> for

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
to stay there and to probably pay for

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.610 
to stay there and to probably pay for
the<00:04:05.370> Dallas<00:04:05.699> tickets<00:04:06.269> or<00:04:06.389> whatever<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:07.560> know

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the Dallas tickets or whatever you know

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.110 
the Dallas tickets or whatever you know
it's<00:04:07.769> not<00:04:08.220> very<00:04:08.310> cheap<00:04:08.579> thing<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.909> especially

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it's not very cheap thing and especially

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.249 
it's not very cheap thing and especially
while<00:04:09.359> I'm<00:04:09.389> at<00:04:09.509> University<00:04:10.019> it's<00:04:10.139> not
