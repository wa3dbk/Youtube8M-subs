again it's always in the game right it's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
again it's always in the game right it's
not<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.099> new<00:02:20.250> objective<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.120> top

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
not just new objective go to this top

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.780 
not just new objective go to this top
top<00:02:21.780> left<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.319> also<00:02:23.130> what's<00:02:23.280> interesting<00:02:23.519> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
top left and also what's interesting is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
top left and also what's interesting is
that<00:02:23.819> there's<00:02:24.300> two<00:02:24.420> layers<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:24.989> right<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
that there's two layers to it right the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
that there's two layers to it right the
first<00:02:25.860> one<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.130> there's<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.819> objective<00:02:27.300> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
first one is there's your objective but

first one is there's your objective but
it's<00:02:27.690> also<00:02:27.870> where<00:02:28.290> its<00:02:28.470> projected<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.670> like

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
it's also where its projected it's like

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.790 
it's also where its projected it's like
serving<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> 3d<00:02:30.810> Waypoint<00:02:31.230> almost<00:02:31.590> right

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
serving like a 3d Waypoint almost right

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440 
serving like a 3d Waypoint almost right
so<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.250> filtrate<00:02:32.610> dimension<00:02:33.060> where<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.300> it

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
so in filtrate dimension where is it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.470 
so in filtrate dimension where is it
written<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.590> mansion<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.360> it's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
written on the mansion right so it's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
written on the mansion right so it's
like<00:02:36.600> helping<00:02:36.959> us<00:02:37.080> guide<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.380> players<00:02:37.620> again

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
fast so that's what we want to deliver

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.380 
fast so that's what we want to deliver
so<00:03:10.709> now<00:03:10.829> alex<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.190> ready<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.730> marks<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.120> white

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
so now alex is ready the marks are white

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.550 
so now alex is ready the marks are white
which<00:03:12.690> means<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> doesn't<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.350> line<00:03:13.530> of

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
which means it doesn't have line of

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.110 
which means it doesn't have line of
sight<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.070> needs<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.489> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> proper

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sight so it needs to get in the proper

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.349 
sight so it needs to get in the proper
position<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.570> do<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.170> open<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> door<00:03:16.829> and
