in Minneapolis at the University of
Minnesota<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.690> many<00:00:48.989> big<00:00:49.320> cities<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:50.039> many

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
Minnesota in so many big cities or many

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.700 
Minnesota in so many big cities or many
large<00:00:50.730> universities<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.230> something

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
large universities would have something

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
large universities would have something
similar<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.059> thing<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.270> distinguishes

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
similar the one thing that distinguishes

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.880 
similar the one thing that distinguishes
us<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> our<00:00:56.030> ability<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> cooperate

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
us i think is our ability to cooperate

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.799 
us i think is our ability to cooperate
amongst<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> different<00:00:59.219> disciplines<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.539> we

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
amongst the different disciplines so we

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
amongst the different disciplines so we
have<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.260> quality<00:01:01.800> system<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.149> one

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
have one quality system and we have one

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469 
have one quality system and we have one
quality<00:01:04.229> unit<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.129> controls<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.880> facility

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
quality unit that controls the facility

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.070 
quality unit that controls the facility
and<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.650> work<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.549> various<00:01:09.540> researchers

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and we can work with various researchers

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
and we can work with various researchers
if<00:01:10.409> they're<00:01:10.619> working<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:10.979> solid<00:01:11.670> organs

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
if they're working with solid organs

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
if they're working with solid organs
with<00:01:12.299> livers<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> pancreas<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.950> if

they're<00:01:14.490> working<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.760> liquid<00:01:15.409> products

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
they're working with liquid products

stem cells all of those products need to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.030 
stem cells all of those products need to
be<00:01:22.320> handled<00:01:23.600> slightly<00:01:24.600> differently<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
be handled slightly differently and so

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.179 
be handled slightly differently and so
we<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.119> manage<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.409> through<00:01:28.740> having

out our 10,000 facility that we're in
right<00:02:16.390> now<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.830> floor<00:02:18.100> does<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.640> not<00:02:18.940> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
right now the floor does is not a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.380 
right now the floor does is not a
linoleum<00:02:19.510> or<00:02:20.250> vinyl<00:02:21.250> base<00:02:21.520> flooring<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.240> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
linoleum or vinyl base flooring this is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.300 
linoleum or vinyl base flooring this is
actually<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> resin<00:02:23.290> based<00:02:23.410> seal<00:02:23.800> directly

actually a resin based seal directly
over<00:02:24.550> concrete<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.660> there<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.930> no<00:02:27.240> vinyl

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240

a basic lab and so these people figured

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.140 
a basic lab and so these people figured
out<00:04:17.530> how<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.830> do<00:04:18.099> it<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.549> test

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150
