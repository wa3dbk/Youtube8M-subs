00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello my name is Christina and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.690
 today i will tell you about the little book which 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.750
 I read them in December was already 6 pieces 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.240
 dinner is a very big figure to be honest 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.820
 I thought that in this place I did nothing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 I do not read it but it happened before Christmas 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.550
 miracle and six books 1 became a book 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.430
 somerset moema moon and penniless 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 and I read the truth and not in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.480
 December and in November 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.059
 the very end of the month but in November 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.489
 report video report i will get enough 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.210
 books and having been afraid that in December nothing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.719
 don't honor 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.540
 I still translate it into this video about mom 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 I really liked a penny and I already 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 made a separate report to him if anyone 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.370
 it is interesting you click on my hand and he 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.199
 a separate window will appear next book 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.750
 which i would like to tell is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 paper house samarium Carl Dominguez 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 the story of a man is not told 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 which goes in search of a clue 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.339
 secrets and one book that sent by 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.740
 mail his colleagues who killed under the wheels 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.710
 car literally just recently 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.780
 if I speak the truth, the book is not for me 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.220
 I just didn't like it 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 I say that she is bad but personally I do not know 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.740
 what to say just like this next book 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 I read about December became 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 you never dreamed of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.130
 they pack a lot and patty belt i 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 also already made a separate video also 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 click on the hand and go on it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 if I am interested in what I pause between 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 to the word 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.140
 back in December I read a book if 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.750
 one winter night traveler written 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.550
 italo calvino you picnic i learned from 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.890
 video chat she is a very interesting day 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.250
 and really told this book 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.320
 completely different from what I read 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.940
 I will not tell everyone before 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 subtleties not to deprive you 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.130
 pleasure to feel it when 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.009
 reading for the first time just say 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.240
 In this book many books literally 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.240
 book in book 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.980
 the narration is very unusual but to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.709
 Sorry all the books that were 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.320
 mentioned inside this book in any way me 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.630
 not affected and probably so I donâ€™t 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.940
 I can say that I really liked 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.440
 works the idea the very idea of how 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.390
 organized letters seems to me very 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.530
 interesting i advise you to read i 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.290
 I think you dreamed 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.630
 something like this and if you read write 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.489
 in the comments that it was also in 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.410
 December I read about I am from Voltaire 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.380
 buzzard caligula in one of his 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 previous videos 7 of their authors I said 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 that I want to get acquainted with creativity 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.170
 albera kamyu and the beginning and not with the fact that 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.610
 initially intended but unfortunately 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.380
 I can not say my 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.950
 final opinion about this 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.480
 plays I plan and and reread and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.220
 maybe I'll make a separate video in the meantime 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.709
 can't say anything but play to me 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.140
 I liked it if I liked the word 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.079
 appropriate to use in context three 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.720
 plays and the last book which 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.060
 read in December became mashenka 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.220
 Vladimir Nabokov Vladimir Nabokov I 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.070
 also mentioned a 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.990
 I saw 7 and familiar authors and mashenka 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.240
 became the first work that I have 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.670
 I read him very much liked the language 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.400
 narratives in this novel and honestly 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.930
 saying I assumed that they were writing 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.640
 completely different novel 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.980
 the story of the Russians is told 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.640
 immigrants who fled from Russia in 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.580
 time of revolution and remember the motherland 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.010
 each in its own way in the novel is amazing 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.190
 subtly described the relationship of heroes with 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.530
 past and present, then how different heroes 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.140
 get along with this their past how 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.580
 they can live on with this past or 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.709
 without this past 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.470
 I really liked the parallels that 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.720
 were held between Russia and Maschkoy 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.630
 the main character was in love with 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 the novel is written very beautifully and skillfully 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.880
 probably this work is the best 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.060
 from what I read in December and yes 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040
 lately in the birds and I plan and 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.650
 continue my acquaintance with 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.799
 Nabokov's works are all books 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.510
 which I read in December on this 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.510
 see you soon
