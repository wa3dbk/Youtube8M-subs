00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 First of all, install 2 styles for artists, links available in the Guide. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 One showing the flight time of the projectile, the other showing the limits of the tilting works. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I did not manage to finish the set, but meanwhile IS-7 appeared. I'll set up later. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 You do not always have the comfort to see the result of your shot. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 You have to move in order not to get a counter. In any case, the IS-7 had 2150 HP. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 And now he has 601. We'll be back to him in a moment. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 The action with E-75 is key. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Just like that. Now let's go back to IS-7. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 He disappeared, but this movie is about predicting opponent's moves. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Another battle, in a not very favorable artillery in the urban environment. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 This shot is not very much about predicting movements, but I could not resist ... 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 However, this one is the most. Our T-62A has got JgPz E-100, but it is flanked. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Last action. Hostile AMX 50 120 fell into the base and makes artillery slaughter. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 We count his shots! One two Three... 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Well, this hit did not work, but in the meantime he scored 4 times. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 However, we remember that the AMX 50 120 with the top gun has a magazine for 4 missiles. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And that it loads a little over 30 seconds. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 However, I am charging a bit under 30 seconds and I started doing it a bit earlier. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 So I have time to accurately target. In direct mode, not in advance.
