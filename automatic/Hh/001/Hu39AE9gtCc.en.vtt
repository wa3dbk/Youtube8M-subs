00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.790
 I attach what we cut and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.490
 we got this result 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.679
 is, as seen here, we bear all 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.060
 ok here we have a little bit a little bit 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:28.199
 but all of us are already grinding it 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:34.210
 we cut this way and the nose at us 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:38.230
 it turned out like this, we all 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.559
 turned out I think what happened 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 not bad 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 can we 3rd person 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 and brew it all well as it should 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.579
 all be 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.480
 that is, if and also if you need 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.060
 drill a hole 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.080
 make and small drilling around 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.340
 there was a sea 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.660
 even he twosome as you can break out and 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.660
 the middle is very easy and simple and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.770
 present the parts where necessary 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:22.960
 and I'll brew it sat halts I 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:27.330
 and I will show the final result 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.330
 that we will succeed in this matter 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.500
 I thought I'll show you already 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.470
 welded our item but could not resist 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.229
 decided nevertheless to show the accuracy of that 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.190
 what we cut out all here you can see 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.430
 here is a macro shot 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.130
 what here is the gap here little this 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.910
 do you understand that all the density 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:03.430
 becomes 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:08.470
 it's all brewed i mean everything goes 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.239
 even very well plump 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.739
 cut from the grinder is much thicker than 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:22.450
 even there some of us just come out and how 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:25.090
 sits our hole cut all clear 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.160
 right now I love billet 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.450
 she pulled out easily inserted here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.549
 everything is inserted livon that clearly 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.000
 since everything should be our way 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:47.530
 contour all welded shows beauty 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.530
 and not much I then about tvicha 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.250
 knocked off 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:07.329
 I can show it from the side how it is 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:07.329
 looks going from below us 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:18.400
 cuts that is if you look here 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:22.239
 so here is the camera sharpness well what's bad 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.560
 leads to the right places 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:31.930
 but no less than the species that now speak 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.799
 Instantly ours that will cut such under 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.170
 jack 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:44.650
 he goes in the original so here with 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:45.960
 projection so everything should be well 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 everything 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:56.300
 finished here - our box in this 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:04:01.620
 place turn to the top used to say on top 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.910
 so in the continuation I want to show that we 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.490
 still doing 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:12.200
 and we do arrested our front 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:16.380
 shock beams so-called i 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.770
 shockproof yes and she is with us because 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.160
 what was not exhibited here went here in 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.670
 inward she spread a little 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.550
 our racks so i'm on the grill like 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.230
 you can see here the hood wings and now I want 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.430
 fit this whole thing a little bit 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.930
 pull ravine vymeryat size 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:41.580
 put our before see what 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:47.490
 it will turn out and then go further it 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:50.210
 I did the ram so I would do it 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.740
 the way the cable goes up 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.610
 then comes our beams 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.860
 exactly and the other end is about twisted 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.850
 the pipe is fixed like this 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.020
 the design is plain turned out well 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.810
 will try something 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:13.230
 pull up their hook I moved to another 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:19.700
 side to diagonally pull in 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.700
 the other side but for now Iâ€™ll look like it 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.050
 stern she 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.650
 so 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.070
 continue 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.070
 I can not any more 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.560
 chair flooded 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.439
 to all 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.380
 as long as we 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.610
 water just pours 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.960
 the garden is amazing 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.530
 gloves 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.700
 Cossacks worth 1 you ate 3 times in the car 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.300
 here is our parachute harris hold another 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.629
 how gold will last good 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.629
 masonry 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.890
 logan 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.969
 yes hold or on that side 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.969
 but 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.199
 did not take the car and hold it up 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.199
 there are not many who
