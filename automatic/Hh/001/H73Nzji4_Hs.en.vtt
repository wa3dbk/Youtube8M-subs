00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.690
 new technique sloth video good two 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.570
 weeks I have now the external battery 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.269
 from monday in use had time for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.429
 a test conclusion you already see it me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 I wrote it again post 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 because the most important thing about these external ones 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
 how much of the battery is 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 indicated capacity comes with yours 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.350
 devices are really on 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 and I have only the last one here 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.219
 posts and can directly say that now 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.940
 tactile provides catastrophic values 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:37.170
 absolute cheese absolutely no 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.120
 Purchase recommendation from me 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 but in turn what I have the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 Battery naturally tested with 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 various smartphones the main load 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.110
 but had to wear the apple ipad 2 because 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.030
 I needed a device with a big one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.739
 battery to the halt at a reasonable 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 always be able to test through tour 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.020
 the day battery comes with a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.870
 specified capacity of 10,000 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
 milliampere, so already a me 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 Tell me something mean earlier 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.520
 large order now only 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.740
 a medium carroll category and it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 is clear or it should be clear that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 for these external batteries the specified 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.259
 capacity does not match 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.360
 and also can not agree with 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.790
 what with your terminals then 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 it really matters so you could go here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.570
 mine here is 10,000 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.119
 milliamps on it if I then 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 a smartphone with a 2000 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.880
 milliamps have battery then 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.070
 can I charge that five times no 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 that could be so if the manufacturer 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 an even larger battery has been installed as 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.729
 he says you have one here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 usually a loss or you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.530
 always have a loss be it at the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.899
 Conversion or be it a heat loss 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 My experience has to have you there 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.060
 with a loss of i say 10 15 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.590
 I expect 20 percent that I have everything 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 already experienced that everything is so 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.820
 moving within the framework means coming here 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 then not 10,000 milliamps 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.399
 out but I say 20 percent 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.970
 loss 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.790
 then that's 8000 milliamps 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.069
 means you can do yours 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.609
 2000 milliamps of smartphone after 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.780
 Prove it exactly four times and charge 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.510
 then that's it and that's natural 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.170
 a good value what is still to come 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.319
 my readings out an apple ipad 2 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.430
 has a battery capacity of 7340 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.859
 Millennia and unfortunately he could 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.709
 only and that is really catastrophic 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:42.840
 just from the monday battery just around 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.370
 which will be charged 60 percent 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.019
 means if you convert it 60 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.700
 percent of 7340 are 4400 and 4 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.790
 billion hours 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 the end of your terminals 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.139
 are available and also arrive and that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.480
 is just catastrophic 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.939
 So I do not even have 50 here 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.459
 percent of the specified capacity comes 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.010
 with me at my terminals on but 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.629
 Hold only the pi times thumb 44 percent 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.530
 And that is a disaster because it needs 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.280
 not to talk about it 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.329
 the thing is cheese that it must of course 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.659
 Of course it can be me 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.979
 got defective monday device 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.989
 but should still I go to number 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:25.269
 sure and do not recommend it very clearly 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.739
 not and I say many more 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.750
 It probably does not fall that way 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.090
 They are glad if you then her her 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.859
 smartphone charged two times 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.989
 get or once and another one 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.639
 a little bit the next day and for that 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.409
 Is that enough but maybe if you 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.909
 then get a little more intense with it 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.560
 it's just busy 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.810
 catastrophic so from the capacity 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.870
 under real conditions, those of yours 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.709
 equipment arrives murks for the price of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.379
 that's about 28 euros, of course 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.030
 murks and compared to other batteries 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.579
 there are even cheaper or 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.829
 comparable here that would be me 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.269
 also called very thick that is 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.069
 already a massive thing not even 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.579
 so difficult but of the design 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.870
 but a bit thick 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.609
 But there are pluses for me 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.500
 hardly anything glossy here 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.120
 I'm here at the upper landings as well 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.939
 piano lacquer look but that's the way it is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.099
 shiny plastic, I think the beautiful 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.289
 asians tend to be with the 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.029
 batteries always glossy optics then 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.889
 very quickly scratched what I at one 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.020
 External battery can not understand 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.120
 This is a huge job 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.490
 now to load we have a micro usb 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.139
 port that is very nice standard 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.940
 The combination is not wonderful on the idea 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.129
 still to install mini or any 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.750
 other connection sources the adapter 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.479
 or something is fine 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 I then turned on and off 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.400
 pluses and i have four leds that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.650
 then permanently light up when I do that 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.930
 Use the thing to show me then 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.560
 As the capacity is okay 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.050
 then unfortunately I have only one usb 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.169
 on a device what 10 1000 milliampere 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.030
 or to have find to have claimed 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.319
 Me too a bit leaner than me 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.720
 I'm going to assume who is such a 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.580
 big battery worried takes something like that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.900
 probably I'll say tablet and 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.220
 to load smartphone 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.169
 Of course, that's not the case if I am then 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.389
 two USB ports so I did the things 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.389
 in the evening both parallel to the network to the 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.099
 Of course, throwing a battery can be enough 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.440
 also come with a battery with a 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.139
 usb-port of course I would be there but with 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.030
 as soon as the capacity is displayed 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.449
 I would be five digits 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.340
 also look forward to the second usb port 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.520
 that should be but sorry to 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.900
 be as cute as that thing is called but 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.940
 that was nothing 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.259
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.259
 and until the next video
