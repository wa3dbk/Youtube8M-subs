good morning I'm Zoe and today we are

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.900 
good morning I'm Zoe and today we are
going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.419> watch<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.080> dough<00:00:04.259> rise<00:00:04.759> many<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
going to watch the dough rise many of

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to watch the dough rise many of
you<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.420> asked<00:00:06.810> us<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> website<00:00:08.490> what

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
you have asked us on the website what

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.850 
you have asked us on the website what
your<00:00:09.570> dough<00:00:09.750> should<00:00:09.780> look<00:00:10.110> like<00:00:10.200> after<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
your dough should look like after the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.530 
your dough should look like after the
initial<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.460> our<00:00:11.670> fries<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> thought<00:00:12.509> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
initial to our fries so I thought I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.980 
initial to our fries so I thought I
would<00:00:12.719> show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.980> master<00:00:14.549> from

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
would show you I have a master from

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.359 
would show you I have a master from
artisan<00:00:15.990> bread<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.410> five<00:00:16.529> minutes<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.920> day<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
artisan bread and five minutes a day and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
artisan bread and five minutes a day and
a<00:00:18.000> master<00:00:18.570> from<00:00:18.840> healthy<00:00:19.439> Breton<00:00:19.770> five

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
a master from healthy Breton five

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.340 
a master from healthy Breton five
minutes<00:00:20.460> I've<00:00:20.910> mixed<00:00:21.240> both<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> dough's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
minutes I've mixed both of the dough's

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.279 
minutes I've mixed both of the dough's
using<00:00:22.920> warm<00:00:23.340> water<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.570> use<00:00:24.600> cool<00:00:25.260> water

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
using warm water you can use cool water

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.589 
using warm water you can use cool water
but<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.430> longer<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but it will just take longer for the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
but it will just take longer for the
dough's<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.109> rise<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:29.070> also<00:00:29.340> used<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> full

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
dough's to rise I've also used the full

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.759 
dough's to rise I've also used the full
amount<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.599> yeast<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> half

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
amount of yeast which is one and a half

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.090 
amount of yeast which is one and a half
tablespoons<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.420> full<00:00:33.690> amount<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.559> salt

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
tablespoons and the full amount of salt

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
tablespoons and the full amount of salt
which<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.940> half<00:00:35.969> tablespoons<00:00:36.660> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
which is one and a half tablespoons for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
which is one and a half tablespoons for
the<00:00:36.989> artisan<00:00:37.530> bread<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.800> five<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.420> one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the artisan bread and five and one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.560 
the artisan bread and five and one
tablespoon<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.550> healthy<00:00:41.940> bread<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.329> five

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
tablespoon for the healthy bread in five

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
tablespoon for the healthy bread in five
so<00:00:43.379> after<00:00:43.829> two<00:00:44.010> hours<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> come<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:44.969> we'll

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so after two hours and come back we'll

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
so after two hours and come back we'll
see<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.340> actually<00:00:47.340> I'm

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
see what they look like actually I'm

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.459 
see what they look like actually I'm
going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.210> whole<00:00:48.480> process<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
going to show you the whole process of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:09.790 
going to show you the whole process of
it<00:00:49.620> rising

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.460 

exactly<00:01:10.800> two<00:01:11.130> hours<00:01:11.190> has<00:01:11.700> passed<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> two

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
exactly two hours has passed and the two

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.520 
exactly two hours has passed and the two
dough's<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:14.220> actually<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.300> about<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:16.200> same

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
dough's are actually just about the same

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
dough's are actually just about the same
let's<00:01:16.980> pop<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.370> up<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> check<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.650> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
let's pop them up and check it out I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.990 
let's pop them up and check it out I
have<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.820> hole<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.380> top<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:22.980> lid<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.580> don't

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
have a hole in the top of my lid I don't

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
have a hole in the top of my lid I don't
know<00:01:24.120> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.300> can<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.110> well

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
know if you can see that very well

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
know if you can see that very well
right<00:01:26.480> here<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.380> allows<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.580> shut

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
right here and that allows me to shut

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.350 
right here and that allows me to shut
the<00:01:30.420> lid<00:01:30.900> completely<00:01:31.790> you'll<00:01:32.790> notice<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> all

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the lid completely you'll notice in all

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.720 
the lid completely you'll notice in all
the<00:01:33.510> recipes<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.050> say<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.040> lid<00:01:35.700> on

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
the recipes we say to put the lid on

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.570 
the recipes we say to put the lid on
loosely<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.020> I've<00:01:37.170> drilled<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.920> holes<00:01:38.190> in

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
loosely but I've drilled little holes in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.230 
loosely but I've drilled little holes in
my<00:01:38.760> lids<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.660> I<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.229> pop<00:01:40.680> them<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
my lids so that I can pop them on

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.310 
my lids so that I can pop them on
tightly<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:42.750> they're<00:01:42.900> easier<00:01:43.260> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
tightly and that way they're easier to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.110 
tightly and that way they're easier to
stack<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> refrigerator<00:01:44.370> so<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.790> look

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
stack in the refrigerator so they look

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.140 
stack in the refrigerator so they look
really<00:01:45.780> comparable<00:01:46.680> they're<00:01:47.580> starting<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
really comparable they're starting to

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.090 
really comparable they're starting to
flatten<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:49.140> means<00:01:49.470> they're<00:01:49.770> ready

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
flatten out which means they're ready

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.410 
flatten out which means they're ready
now<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:51.450> either<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.430> put<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
now to either use or to put them in the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.180 
now to either use or to put them in the
refrigerator<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.890> dip

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
refrigerator and then I can just dip

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.340 
refrigerator and then I can just dip
into<00:01:56.400> them<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.660> next<00:01:57.840> couple<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> weeks

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
into them over the next couple of weeks

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.609 
into them over the next couple of weeks
and<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.970> exactly<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:01.050> your<00:02:01.380> dough

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and that is exactly what your dough

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.670 
and that is exactly what your dough
should<00:02:02.100> look<00:02:02.160> like<00:02:02.310> after<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.780> risen<00:02:04.440> for

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
should look like after it's risen for

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.660 
should look like after it's risen for
two<00:02:04.950> hours<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.190> nice<00:02:08.340> air

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
two hours you can see all the nice air

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.000 
two hours you can see all the nice air
bubbles<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.360> developed<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.860> dough

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
bubbles that have developed in the dough

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.330 
bubbles that have developed in the dough
and<00:02:11.040> that's<00:02:11.370> exactly<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.239> want<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
and that's exactly what you want and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.030 
and that's exactly what you want and
once<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.640> refrigerate<00:02:15.570> these<00:02:15.900> these<00:02:16.739> dough's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
once I refrigerate these these dough's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.290 
once I refrigerate these these dough's
may<00:02:17.310> actually<00:02:17.519> collapse<00:02:18.209> all<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.900> way<00:02:18.989> down

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
may actually collapse all the way down

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.030 
may actually collapse all the way down
almost<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.570> back<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.050> where<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.500> started

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
almost right back to where they started

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
almost right back to where they started
from<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.640> that's<00:02:24.090> absolutely<00:02:24.780> fine<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
from and that's absolutely fine and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.860 
from and that's absolutely fine and
completely<00:02:26.190> normal<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.880> will<00:02:27.030> never<00:02:27.450> rise

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
completely normal and it will never rise

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.020 
completely normal and it will never rise
up<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.530> again<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.220> only<00:02:29.489> get<00:02:29.730> this

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
up like this again so you only get this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.710 
up like this again so you only get this
rise<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.769> first<00:02:32.010> initial<00:02:32.670> two<00:02:33.030> hour<00:02:33.269> all

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
rise for the first initial two hour all

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.440 
rise for the first initial two hour all
of<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.320> those<00:02:34.830> bubbles<00:02:35.280> are<00:02:35.459> still<00:02:35.880> intact

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
of that those bubbles are still intact

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.199 
of that those bubbles are still intact
they're<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.019> compressed<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.209> happy

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
they're just compressed of it happy
