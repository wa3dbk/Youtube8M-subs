00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
the whole lifestyle pretty well I mean

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.359 
the whole lifestyle pretty well I mean
essentially<00:01:34.649> that<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:34.979> what<00:01:35.190> we're<00:01:35.340> doing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
essentially that is what we're doing

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.790 
essentially that is what we're doing
we're<00:01:35.940> building<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.599> bodies<00:01:37.170> whether<00:01:37.619> we

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
we're building our bodies whether we

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.770 
we're building our bodies whether we
choose<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.429> on<00:01:38.520> stage<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.819> compete<00:01:39.119> or

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
choose to get on stage and compete or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.219 
choose to get on stage and compete or
not<00:01:39.989> that's<00:01:40.649> our<00:01:40.860> own<00:01:41.069> decision<00:01:41.640> but

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
not that's our own decision but

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
not that's our own decision but
technically<00:01:43.399> we're<00:01:44.399> bodybuilding<00:01:45.149> that's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
technically we're bodybuilding that's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
technically we're bodybuilding that's
what<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.020> doing<00:01:46.580> if<00:01:47.580> you'd<00:01:47.729> rather<00:01:47.880> me<00:01:48.119> call

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
what we're doing if you'd rather me call

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
what we're doing if you'd rather me call
us<00:01:48.630> transformers<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.649> could<00:01:49.800> do<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.039> too

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
us transformers I could do that too

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.190 
us transformers I could do that too
because<00:01:50.459> essentially<00:01:51.179> we<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.539> transforming

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
because essentially we are transforming

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.589 
because essentially we are transforming
our<00:01:52.349> physiques<00:01:52.830> as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.479> anyway<00:01:54.479> that's

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
our physiques as well anyway that's

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.680 
our physiques as well anyway that's
straying<00:01:54.959> away<00:01:55.080> from<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.470> point<00:01:55.739> I<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:57.479> want
