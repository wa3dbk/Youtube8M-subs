hi friends Eric here from around to at

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi friends Eric here from around to at
RC<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.750> today<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.350> will<00:00:04.410> be<00:00:04.470> looking<00:00:04.680> at<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
RC and today we will be looking at a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.800 
RC and today we will be looking at a
three<00:00:05.339> channel<00:00:05.549> surface<00:00:06.089> radio<00:00:06.420> made<00:00:06.660> by

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
three channel surface radio made by

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.770 
three channel surface radio made by
tactic<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.950> TTX<00:00:08.490> 300<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.480> let's<00:00:09.660> go

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
tactic it's the TTX 300 so let's go

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.600 
tactic it's the TTX 300 so let's go
ahead<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.110> pull<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.440> camera<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.160> check

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
ahead and pull that camera in and check

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.140 
ahead and pull that camera in and check
it<00:00:11.759> out

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
it out

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.959 
it out
out<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> box<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> TTX<00:00:14.370> 300

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
out of the box this is what the TTX 300

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
out of the box this is what the TTX 300
looks<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.389> made<00:00:15.630> by<00:00:15.809> tactic<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
looks like made by tactic and it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.099 
looks like made by tactic and it
operates<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> 2.4<00:00:18.180> gigahertz<00:00:18.330> radio

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
operates on the 2.4 gigahertz radio

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
operates on the 2.4 gigahertz radio
frequency<00:00:19.619> range<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.460> pretty<00:00:20.820> much<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
frequency range which is pretty much a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.540 
frequency range which is pretty much a
standard<00:00:21.300> nowadays<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> also<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
standard nowadays but it also has the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.429 
standard nowadays but it also has the
secure<00:00:23.970> link<00:00:24.150> technology<00:00:24.420> protocol<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
secure link technology protocol that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
secure link technology protocol that
you'll<00:00:25.680> find<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.070> other<00:00:26.250> tactic<00:00:26.789> radios<00:00:27.180> now

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you'll find in other tactic radios now

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
you'll find in other tactic radios now
along<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.470> radio<00:00:28.619> itself<00:00:29.099> you'll<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
along with the radio itself you'll get a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.500 
along with the radio itself you'll get a
micro<00:00:30.240> receiver<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.859> tactic<00:00:32.340> tr3<00:00:33.059> 25

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
micro receiver this is the tactic tr3 25

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900 
micro receiver this is the tactic tr3 25
it<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.380> 3<00:00:34.829> channel<00:00:35.010> surface<00:00:35.520> control

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it is a 3 channel surface control

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.760 
it is a 3 channel surface control
receiver<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.200> secure<00:00:37.590> link

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
receiver that has the secure link

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
receiver that has the secure link
technology<00:00:38.010> protocol<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.629> would<00:00:39.840> be

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
technology protocol and this would be

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.680 
technology protocol and this would be
good<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.230> cars<00:00:40.710> trucks<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.550> boats<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
good for cars trucks or boats and you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.299 
good for cars trucks or boats and you
can<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> micro<00:00:43.680> receiver<00:00:44.010> because

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
can see it is a micro receiver because

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.860 
can see it is a micro receiver because
it<00:00:44.460> fits<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> palm<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.360> hand<00:00:45.629> very

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it fits into the palm of my hand very

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740 
it fits into the palm of my hand very
easily<00:00:46.129> now<00:00:47.129> being<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.030> radio<00:00:48.360> system

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
easily now being that this radio system

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.500 
easily now being that this radio system
has<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.230> SLT<00:00:49.620> protocol<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.969> could<00:00:51.120> use<00:00:51.329> other

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
has the SLT protocol you could use other

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.410 
has the SLT protocol you could use other
SLT<00:00:52.440> compatible<00:00:53.070> receivers<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.000> radio

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
SLT compatible receivers with this radio

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
SLT compatible receivers with this radio
but<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.140> remember<00:00:55.320> anything<00:00:56.219> over<00:00:56.550> 3

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but just remember anything over 3

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
but just remember anything over 3
channels<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> receiver<00:00:57.690> line<00:00:58.350> would<00:00:58.739> be

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
channels in the receiver line would be

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
channels in the receiver line would be
overkill<00:00:59.370> because<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> only<00:01:00.629> operate<00:01:00.870> 3

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
overkill because you can only operate 3

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
overkill because you can only operate 3
channels<00:01:01.680> from<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> radio<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.390> now

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the cover back on and you're pretty much

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.139 
the cover back on and you're pretty much
in<00:02:03.180> business<00:02:04.369> now<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
in business now you can see this is a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
in business now you can see this is a
pistol<00:02:06.719> grip<00:02:06.750> design<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> I'll<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.950> using<00:02:08.099> my

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pistol grip design and I'll be using my

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.919 
pistol grip design and I'll be using my
index<00:02:08.759> finger<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> control<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> throttle

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
index finger to control the throttle

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.110 
index finger to control the throttle
then<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> tire<00:02:11.370> light<00:02:11.640> controller

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
then you have the tire light controller

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.570 
then you have the tire light controller
right<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.959> your<00:02:13.080> steer

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
right here for your steer

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.970 
right here for your steer
which<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.120> pretty<00:02:14.300> nice<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.840> then<00:02:15.800> up<00:02:15.950> here

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
which is pretty nice and then up here

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.190 
which is pretty nice and then up here
you<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.340> three<00:02:16.700> dolls<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.510> first<00:02:17.780> one<00:02:17.960> being

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you have three dolls the first one being

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320 
you have three dolls the first one being
for<00:02:18.470> your<00:02:18.680> steering<00:02:19.370> dual<00:02:19.640> rates<00:02:19.970> or

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
for your steering dual rates or

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.180 
for your steering dual rates or
sensitivity<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.830> have<00:02:22.010> your

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
sensitivity and then you have your

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.940 
sensitivity and then you have your
throttle<00:02:22.550> trim<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.570> steering<00:02:23.900> trim<00:02:24.200> now

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
throttle trim and your steering trim now

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.500 
throttle trim and your steering trim now
this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.250> where<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.520> cool<00:02:25.730> factor<00:02:26.120> kicks<00:02:26.330> in

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
this is where the cool factor kicks in

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.660 
this is where the cool factor kicks in
on<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.780> radio<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.710> actually<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.400> two

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
on this radio you actually have two

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.000 
on this radio you actually have two
switches<00:02:29.000> right<00:02:29.360> here<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:30.770> are<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
switches right here and these are the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.470 
switches right here and these are the
switches<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.760> would<00:02:31.880> use<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.450> make

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
switches that you would use to make

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.360 
switches that you would use to make
endpoint<00:02:33.170> adjustments<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.890> your<00:02:34.070> steering

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
endpoint adjustments to your steering

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.730 
endpoint adjustments to your steering
and<00:02:34.670> throttle<00:02:34.730> control<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:36.230> also

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
and throttle control and this also

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.010 
and throttle control and this also
controls<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> third<00:02:37.700> channel<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.690> radio

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
controls the third channel on the radio

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.470 
controls the third channel on the radio
itself<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:40.220> that's<00:02:40.460> pretty<00:02:40.640> cool<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
itself now that's pretty cool so you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720 
itself now that's pretty cool so you
have<00:02:41.780> endpoint<00:02:42.200> adjustment<00:02:42.800> control<00:02:43.190> here<00:02:43.580> or

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
have endpoint adjustment control here or

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.550 
have endpoint adjustment control here or
you<00:02:44.000> could<00:02:44.120> use<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.330> as<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.630> multi<00:02:45.110> position

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
you could use it as a multi position

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.650 
you could use it as a multi position
switch<00:02:45.770> where<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.640> could<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.970> two<00:02:47.210> three<00:02:47.450> or

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
switch where you could have two three or

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.230 
switch where you could have two three or
four<00:02:47.840> positions<00:02:48.320> or<00:02:48.890> you<00:02:49.130> could<00:02:49.280> use<00:02:49.460> this<00:02:49.640> to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
four positions or you could use this to

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.030 
four positions or you could use this to
control<00:02:50.540> proportional<00:02:51.440> controls<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.950> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
control proportional controls on the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
control proportional controls on the
third<00:02:52.220> Channel<00:02:52.640> now<00:02:53.300> where<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.630> would<00:02:53.870> come

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
third Channel now where this would come

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
third Channel now where this would come
in<00:02:54.230> handy<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.890> say<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:55.520> example<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.060> your

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
in handy is say for example on your

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.880 
in handy is say for example on your
buggy<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.840> set<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.230> lights<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.650> you

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
buggy you have a set of lights that you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.490 
buggy you have a set of lights that you
want<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.130> turn<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.640> or<00:02:59.120> off<00:02:59.150> well<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.140> could<00:03:00.320> do

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
want to turn on or off well you could do

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.920 
want to turn on or off well you could do
that<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.450> programmable<00:03:02.450> switches

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
that with these programmable switches

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
that with these programmable switches
right<00:03:03.080> here<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.620> third<00:03:03.800> channel<00:03:04.250> which

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
right here for the third channel which

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.850 
right here for the third channel which
is<00:03:05.360> pretty<00:03:05.600> cool<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.080> won't<00:03:06.200> find<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.650> on

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
is pretty cool you won't find this on

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.150 
is pretty cool you won't find this on
any<00:03:07.459> other<00:03:07.640> radios<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.840> design<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.770> I

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
any other radios of this design and I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.949 
any other radios of this design and I
like<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.640> now<00:03:11.000> they<00:03:11.180> could<00:03:11.360> have<00:03:11.480> made<00:03:11.660> these

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
like that now they could have made these

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.910 
like that now they could have made these
switches<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:14.150> here<00:03:14.510> somewhere<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.170> taking<00:03:15.800> up

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
switches up here somewhere and taking up

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.320 
switches up here somewhere and taking up
more<00:03:16.070> real<00:03:16.280> estate<00:03:16.430> on<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> face<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.240> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
more real estate on the face of the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.880 
more real estate on the face of the
controller<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.260> they<00:03:18.410> tucked<00:03:18.680> them<00:03:18.830> away

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
controller but they tucked them away

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.460 
controller but they tucked them away
right<00:03:19.280> here<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.880> made<00:03:20.450> them<00:03:20.660> where<00:03:21.200> they're

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
right here and made them where they're

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.110 
right here and made them where they're
not<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.890> way<00:03:22.040> but<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.580> can<00:03:22.730> still<00:03:22.910> have

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
not in the way but you can still have

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.759 
not in the way but you can still have
access<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.570> them<00:03:23.870> while<00:03:24.230> you're<00:03:24.350> controlling

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
access to them while you're controlling

one<00:03:29.930> being<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.260> power<00:03:30.470> switch<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.489> when<00:03:31.730> you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
one being a power switch and when you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.970 
one being a power switch and when you
turn<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.930> see<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> nice<00:03:33.680> red

turn it on you see you have a nice red

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.130 
turn it on you see you have a nice red
LED<00:03:34.489> light<00:03:34.700> right<00:03:34.940> there<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.750> lets<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.019> know

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
LED light right there that lets you know

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.229

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
that the radio is operational and you

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.240 
that the radio is operational and you
will<00:03:38.390> also<00:03:38.570> use<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:39.170> light<00:03:39.470> when<00:03:40.130> you're

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
will also use this light when you're

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520 
will also use this light when you're
programming<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:41.390> third<00:03:41.750> channel<00:03:42.170> using

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
programming that third channel using

programming that third channel using
these<00:03:42.650> switches<00:03:43.040> right<00:03:43.190> here<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:44.030> will<00:03:44.120> flash

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
these switches right here it will flash

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.060 
these switches right here it will flash
a<00:03:44.390> series<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:44.959> times<00:03:45.290> while<00:03:45.739> you're<00:03:45.860> going

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
a series of times while you're going

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.380 
a series of times while you're going
through<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.340> programming<00:03:46.790> stages<00:03:47.239> and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
through the programming stages and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.500 
through the programming stages and
that's<00:03:47.840> all<00:03:48.019> in<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.410> instructions<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that's all in the instructions now the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.540 
that's all in the instructions now the
other<00:03:50.840> two<00:03:51.050> switches<00:03:51.380> are<00:03:51.680> reversing

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550

right<00:03:54.860> there<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.840> pretty<00:03:57.050> much<00:03:57.230> it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
right there and that's pretty much it

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.500 
right there and that's pretty much it
about<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.739> radio<00:03:58.040> itself<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:59.060> can<00:03:59.209> see<00:03:59.239> if

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
about the radio itself you can see if

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.240 
about the radio itself you can see if
it's<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.140> palm<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:00.500> hand<00:04:00.739> very<00:04:00.980> well
