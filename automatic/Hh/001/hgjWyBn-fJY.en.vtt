00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hi everyone, everything's good here, there's nine 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.600
 rasulov literature yes and yes I am 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 filming in a different way I'm 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.870
 filming on my cell phone because I want to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.809
 to test this kind of recording for a beautiful 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.570
 reason is what is the reason why 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 really wanting to make a video 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 about this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.439
 I'm going to biennial so cool. 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.230
 This news is I'm very very very 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.020
 excited about who 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 asked me then I'll be in two 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 weekends 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 so I think the day 23 24 30 and 31 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 I'll be there in the first hour 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.800
 but at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 a little sooner but I'm leaving 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 early even though they 336 because I 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.219
 I live inside so it's 50 minutes 40 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.020
 and 50 minutes drive then stay 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.750
 Complicated back in the afternoon in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.240
 unfortunately, and good I'm recording 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.060
 so because my camera actually 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 she only records 30 minutes what I think 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.200
 bit because I'm going to try to record videos 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.619
 there biennial 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.180
 I 'm not even testing the cell phone 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.750
 so if you're watching this video 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.110
 that's why everyone got reasonable 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.180
 in the foolish attempt I'm not me 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 programming as well as the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.720
 events 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 I'll try to attend more events 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.420
 of editors, not as much as 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 authors because for two simple reasons 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.549
 the first is that it's not really me 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.810
 I'm excited about the authors who are going 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.180
 know nal 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 so there are some that I like but not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.909
 is keen to know your the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 autograph, and a second reason is 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.110
 that most photographers will be 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 Also at night, I will not be able to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.549
 participate in the truth has a third party 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.750
 cause also because I'm mega mega 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.550
 mega end 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.739

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.629
