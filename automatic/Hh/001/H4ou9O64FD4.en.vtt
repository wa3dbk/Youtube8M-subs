00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.849 

okay<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.009> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.549> split<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.839> MIT<00:00:07.560> 1

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
okay so we're going to split this MIT 1

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.400 
okay so we're going to split this MIT 1
MIDI<00:00:08.069> part<00:00:08.340> right<00:00:08.820> into<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> component<00:00:10.050> parts

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
MIDI part right into the component parts

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.560 
MIDI part right into the component parts
of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.280> term<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.030> by<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
of the term so we do this by going to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
of the term so we do this by going to
region<00:00:13.160> split<00:00:14.160> demyx

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
region split demyx

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.960 
region split demyx
and<00:00:15.089> then<00:00:15.660> DMX<00:00:16.080> by<00:00:16.260> node<00:00:16.470> pitch<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.789> see

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and then DMX by node pitch so we can see

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.210 
and then DMX by node pitch so we can see
here<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> actually<00:00:19.170> separated<00:00:20.100> right

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
here that it is actually separated right

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.490 
here that it is actually separated right
all<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> different<00:00:21.060> drum<00:00:21.210> parts<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
all of the different drum parts so if I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.929 
all of the different drum parts so if I
just<00:00:22.740> delete<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.130> first<00:00:23.460> one<00:00:23.670> because

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
just delete this first one because

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.450 
just delete this first one because
there's<00:00:24.150> nothing<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.310> going

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
there's nothing in it and then I'm going

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.320 
there's nothing in it and then I'm going

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
have them all on separate many parts we

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.200 
have them all on separate many parts we
now<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> split<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> drums<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.000> two

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
now want to split the drums up on two

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.480 
now want to split the drums up on two
separate<00:01:18.570> audio<00:01:18.960> channels<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.310> into

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
separate audio channels so if we go into

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.820 
separate audio channels so if we go into
our<00:01:20.610> mixer<00:01:21.150> here

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
our mixer here

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.700 
our mixer here
you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> open<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:28.280> different<00:01:29.280> or

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
you can open up different or

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.410 
you can open up different or
your<00:01:29.799> channels<00:01:30.159> which<00:01:30.460> are<00:01:30.670> connected<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.180> the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
your channels which are connected to the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.000 
your channels which are connected to the
outputs<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.140> ultra<00:01:32.409> beat<00:01:32.440> we<00:01:32.710> can<00:01:32.860> see

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
outputs of the ultra beat we can see

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.600 
outputs of the ultra beat we can see
here<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:34.030> says<00:01:34.090> IO<00:01:34.630> altar<00:01:35.320> bait<00:01:35.500> 3<00:01:36.070> 4<00:01:36.280> ultra

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
here it says IO altar bait 3 4 ultra

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.580 
here it says IO altar bait 3 4 ultra
beat<00:01:36.729> 5<00:01:36.909> SEC's<00:01:37.210> ultimate<00:01:37.510> 7<00:01:37.780> 8<00:01:37.869> ultimate<00:01:38.200> 9<00:01:38.350> 10

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
beat 5 SEC's ultimate 7 8 ultimate 9 10

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.160 
beat 5 SEC's ultimate 7 8 ultimate 9 10
and<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.850> if<00:01:40.090> we<00:01:40.270> go<00:01:40.479> into<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.869> ultra

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
and so on so if we go into the ultra

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.899 
and so on so if we go into the ultra
beat<00:01:41.320> then<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:44.229> can<00:01:44.560> separate<00:01:45.490> by<00:01:45.670> these

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
beat then we can separate by these

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.280 
beat then we can separate by these
different<00:01:46.060> parts<00:01:46.479> so<00:01:46.540> I'm<00:01:46.659> going<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.869> send<00:01:47.110> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so if we now play the track back we'll

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.340 
so if we now play the track back we'll
see<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.989> all<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.540> signs<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:32.019> coming

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
see that all of the signs are now coming

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.860 
see that all of the signs are now coming
through<00:02:32.470> different<00:02:33.040> channels<00:02:33.570> here<00:02:34.570> in<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
through different channels here in the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.479 
through different channels here in the
mixer<00:02:40.200> okay<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.260> these<00:02:41.860> two<00:02:42.100> channels<00:02:42.430> are

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
mixer okay so these two channels are

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.520 
mixer okay so these two channels are
actually<00:02:42.820> unused<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:43.720> go<00:02:44.260> ahead<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
actually unused so we can go ahead and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.680 
actually unused so we can go ahead and
delete<00:02:44.709> these<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.150> need<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.360> rename

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
delete these and we just need to rename

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:11.590 

to<00:03:02.920> write<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.120> produce<00:03:10.120> okay<00:03:11.120> so

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
to write and produce okay so

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.200 
to write and produce okay so
we're<00:03:11.900> going<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.500> import<00:03:13.280> an<00:03:13.490> audio<00:03:13.550> file

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
we're going to import an audio file

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.000 
we're going to import an audio file

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.190 
we're going to actually import an Amen
break<00:03:16.340> which<00:03:16.520> we<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:16.820> find<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.840> other

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
break which we can find in the other

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.980 
break which we can find in the other
side<00:03:19.040> like<00:03:19.190> drama<00:03:19.460> based<00:03:19.700> project<00:03:20.180> fuller<00:03:20.360> so

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
side like drama based project fuller so

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.740 
side like drama based project fuller so
if<00:03:21.080> we<00:03:21.170> go<00:03:21.290> ahead<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.500> click<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.860> here<00:03:22.750> we

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
if we go ahead and click in here we

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.250 
if we go ahead and click in here we
could<00:03:23.870> just<00:03:24.050> grab<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.470> sonic<00:03:24.890> amen<00:03:25.960> we<00:03:26.960> simply

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
could just grab the sonic amen we simply

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.890 
could just grab the sonic amen we simply
drag<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.830> drop<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:29.150> will<00:03:29.300> create<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.720> new

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
drag it and drop it it will create a new

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.380 
drag it and drop it it will create a new
audio<00:03:30.290> track<00:03:30.470> underneath<00:03:31.240> so<00:03:32.240> we're<00:03:32.360> just

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
audio track underneath so we're just

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.510 
audio track underneath so we're just
going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.720> go<00:03:32.870> ahead<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.320> rename<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.830> Amen

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
going to go ahead and rename this Amen

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.070 
going to go ahead and rename this Amen
brick<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:36.880> if<00:03:37.880> we<00:03:38.000> zoom<00:03:38.210> in<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> bit<00:03:38.480> we<00:03:39.050> can

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
brick and if we zoom in a bit we can

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.260 
brick and if we zoom in a bit we can
drag<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.100> back<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.700> start

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
drag it back to the start

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.020 
drag it back to the start
now<00:03:41.930> we<00:03:41.990> can<00:03:42.170> see<00:03:42.350> here<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> main

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
now we can see here that the a main

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.390 
now we can see here that the a main
break<00:03:44.330> doesn't<00:03:44.600> exactly<00:03:45.110> fit<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:48.070> we<00:03:49.070> need<00:03:49.250> to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
break doesn't exactly fit so we need to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.950 
break doesn't exactly fit so we need to
time<00:03:49.700> stretch<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.360> make<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.600> fit<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.930> the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
time stretch it to make it fit with the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.630 
time stretch it to make it fit with the
tempo<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.530> track<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:52.280> we're<00:03:52.370> going<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.550> go

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
tempo of the track so we're going to go

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.930 
tempo of the track so we're going to go
ahead<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.060> set<00:03:53.240> our<00:03:53.270> snap<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.930> bar<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.940> we're

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
ahead and set our snap to bar and we're

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.520 
ahead and set our snap to bar and we're
going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.120> click<00:03:56.300> our<00:03:56.450> Alt<00:03:56.660> key<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:57.410> go

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
going to click our Alt key and if we go

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.410 
going to click our Alt key and if we go
to<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.740> bottom<00:03:58.100> left<00:03:58.490> hand<00:03:58.700> corner<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.180> the

audio file and drag it over

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.990

this<00:04:03.710> will<00:04:03.890> automatically<00:04:05.710> time<00:04:06.710> stretch<00:04:07.070> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
this will automatically time stretch the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.890 
this will automatically time stretch the
sample<00:04:08.690> for<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.020> audio<00:04:09.320> file<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:11.450> make<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.720> fit

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
sample for the audio file to make it fit

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.630
