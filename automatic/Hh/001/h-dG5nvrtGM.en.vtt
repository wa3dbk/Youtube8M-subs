I've<00:00:47.640> heard<00:00:47.910> people<00:00:48.120> say<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> before<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.250 
I've heard people say that before but in
my<00:00:49.620> opinion<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> can't<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
my opinion now it can't because it was a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
my opinion now it can't because it was a
practice<00:00:52.980> evacuation<00:00:53.699> drill<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> wasn't

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
practice evacuation drill it wasn't

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.040 
practice evacuation drill it wasn't
planned

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
planned

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.189 
planned
it<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:55.620> no<00:00:55.800> set<00:00:56.070> objectives<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.480> ezo<00:00:57.840> weren't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it had no set objectives the ezo weren't

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.590 
it had no set objectives the ezo weren't
briefed<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> real<00:00:59.910> thing<00:01:00.210> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
briefed so it was a real thing so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
briefed so it was a real thing so
technically<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> practice<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
technically it's not a practice of

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
technically it's not a practice of
accusation<00:01:03.180> drill<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.600> should<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
accusation drill you should really do a

practice drill for part of the building

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
practice drill for part of the building
otherwise<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> affect

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
otherwise it's really going to affect

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
otherwise it's really going to affect
workplace<00:01:14.220> production<00:01:14.790> yeah<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> understand

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
workplace production yeah I understand

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
workplace production yeah I understand
that<00:01:16.140> look<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.070> need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that look you really need to do a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
that look you really need to do a
practice<00:01:18.210> evacuation<00:01:18.900> drill<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> tests

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
practice evacuation drill that tests

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.950 
practice evacuation drill that tests
your<00:01:19.860> evacuation<00:01:20.310> coordination<00:01:21.270> procedures

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
your evacuation coordination procedures

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440 
your evacuation coordination procedures
so<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:23.549> doing<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so if you can do that by doing part of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.789 
so if you can do that by doing part of
the<00:01:24.509> building<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.170> fine

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the building and that's fine

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.410 
the building and that's fine
regulation<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.729> accept<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.390> being

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
regulation will accept that as being

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
regulation will accept that as being
compliant<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.280> trains<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.759> three

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
compliant but these trains do three

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
compliant but these trains do three
seven<00:01:30.329> four<00:01:30.479> five<00:01:30.780> says<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> should

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
seven four five says that you should

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160 
seven four five says that you should
include<00:01:32.340> every<00:01:33.060> person<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> building<00:01:33.840> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
an evacuation practice drill at least

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
an evacuation practice drill at least
once<00:01:36.210> every<00:01:36.390> twelve<00:01:36.780> months<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.200> therefore<00:01:38.040> if

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
once every twelve months so therefore if

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
once every twelve months so therefore if
you<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.400> part<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> building<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.659> you're

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
you do part of the building then you're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.179 
you do part of the building then you're
gonna<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.200> multiple<00:01:40.650> evacuation

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
gonna have to do multiple evacuation

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.429 
gonna have to do multiple evacuation
drill<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.880> capture<00:01:42.060> everybody<00:01:42.600> what

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
drill so you can capture everybody what

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
drill so you can capture everybody what
if<00:01:43.530> someone<00:01:43.799> refuses<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.549> evacuate<00:01:45.090> during

if someone refuses to evacuate during
the<00:01:45.600> evacuation<00:01:45.810> practice<00:01:46.590> drill<00:01:46.890> obviously

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the evacuation practice drill obviously

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
the evacuation practice drill obviously
everyone<00:01:48.210> should<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:48.570> involved<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.020> the

website<00:03:43.340> if<00:03:43.489> required<00:03:43.850> I've<00:03:44.720> heard<00:03:45.019> people

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
website if required I've heard people

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.080 
website if required I've heard people
speak<00:03:45.470> about<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:46.010> three<00:03:46.310> stages<00:03:46.610> of<00:03:46.880> an

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
speak about the three stages of an

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.930 
speak about the three stages of an
evacuation<00:03:47.570> what<00:03:48.560> does<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.769> mean<00:03:49.010> well

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
evacuation what does this mean well

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.550 
evacuation what does this mean well
depending<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.750> type<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.959> building<00:03:51.260> if

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
depending on the type of building if

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.350 
depending on the type of building if
it's<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.739> multi-story<00:03:52.340> building<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:52.910> maybe<00:03:53.180> a

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
it's a multi-story building or maybe a

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.300 
it's a multi-story building or maybe a
healthcare<00:03:53.660> facility<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:54.650> full<00:03:55.040> evacuation

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
healthcare facility a full evacuation

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.920 
healthcare facility a full evacuation
may<00:03:56.000> not<00:03:56.180> be<00:03:56.300> practicable

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
may not be practicable

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.800 
may not be practicable
so<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.370> instance<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:59.000> could<00:03:59.269> stage<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
so in that instance you could stage the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.930 
so in that instance you could stage the
evacuation<00:04:00.500> stage<00:04:01.100> one<00:04:01.370> would<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.760> move

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
evacuation stage one would be to move

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.120 
evacuation stage one would be to move
people<00:04:02.150> from<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.540> immediate<00:04:02.900> danger<00:04:03.350> stage

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
people from the immediate danger stage

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.790 
people from the immediate danger stage
to<00:04:04.489> maybe<00:04:04.790> removing<00:04:05.510> people<00:04:05.720> from<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.440> floor

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
to maybe removing people from that floor

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.890 
to maybe removing people from that floor
area<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.670> other<00:04:07.790> side<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.060> fire<00:04:08.420> doors<00:04:08.720> and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
area to the other side of fire doors and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.990 
area to the other side of fire doors and
firewalls<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.620> stage<00:04:10.430> three<00:04:10.730> would<00:04:10.880> be<00:04:10.910> a

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
firewalls and stage three would be a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.790 
firewalls and stage three would be a
full<00:04:11.269> evacuation<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.110> whole<00:04:12.260> premises

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
full evacuation of the whole premises

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.340 
full evacuation of the whole premises
should<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.700> conduct<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.120> debrief<00:04:14.540> meeting<00:04:14.959> after

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
should I conduct a debrief meeting after

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.590 
should I conduct a debrief meeting after
