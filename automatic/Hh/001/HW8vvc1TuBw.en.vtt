00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 set the car and recently tormented 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.570
 I went there for three years 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 try to fear what a few times and on 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.610
 Kalinsky Castle 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.750
 bottom of the natural from this 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:07.040
 Colin remains neatly redistributed to me 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.040
 need Kalensky castle things like 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.720
 pass the seam 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.200
 can you take off this janitor he gets up 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.909
 right in exactly this castle but there is if 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.340
 only that will be needed 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.280
 move a little bit to the right table like me 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.080
 I look here to the right because 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 he 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.050
 relies on 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050
 how does he say 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.259
 this one 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.060
 beating work 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.100

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.950

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 put from in easier without janitor become me 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.970
 left with the wipers 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.090
 put it first so here with the janitor 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.989
 spun there on the shelf the view he gets up you 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.280
 understand how it costs verbal inserts 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.550
 twisted but he did not close to the end 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.340
 there was a huge gap had to saw off 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.739
 not 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.880
 weld ears a little bit away just 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:33.480
 cut the lock like here locks cut 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.190
 Naturally closers will need 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.220
 electronic cable there pulls and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.650

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.640

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.640

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.090
 that's not the channel 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.300
 triggering water 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.470
