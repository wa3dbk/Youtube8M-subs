00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.940
 it's very nice Georg Willeit in the Sarah of football manager 2011 and if 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.819
 Ask a few questions now 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.869
 a majority Hello 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.520
 solved the Astra which expect food and his Poser Manager 2011 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.789
 during this year and 2 - know the features of the game focused 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.750
 mainly on deployment tactics 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.839
 and you to the transfer market and there are 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.329
 altogether determined already 50 different improvements 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.780
 because important especially already clock range that is now all about fully occupied it 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.269
 called 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.799
 In addition, such a small field, for example, on which he makes his attitude 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:42.670
 rather 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 No, you have all the space available for tactical things 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 right on the pitch too, not just one anymore 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.530
 List but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 times sets directly next to the field 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.100
 and how, for example, are open again and effective 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.560
 set in the player can tell the routes communicate 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.770
 and I think it's all in all who have nice improvements right now 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.000
 tactical field and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.269
 in the transfer market 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.300
 Brown's very important to us this 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.030
 These summer theaters must submit all those transfers 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.280
 MK last year when I played there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 around Real Madrid and all the barrel and Bayern Munich 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.700
 all this tension this summer the ruler of as 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.430
 Fehrenbach not every day 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.980
 On the internet with fever water just happened and around on maybe the too 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.440
 we come or not and 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.260
 everything always goes back and forth to that we want in the game for illustrations 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.320
 and then tried 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.980
 practically all these transfers even among newspaper reports, so to speak 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.429
 to capture that is 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.820
 You can then go if such a transfer men worked really go 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.720
 you can leaf through what the old days are happening to what sort of way 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.420
 led the test match in the end then comes or just 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.240
 to the competitors applies 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.550
 yes, last year, Dr 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.110
 the fools introduced a mode 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 what could he advise therefore this 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.829
 what the online mode Bayer first to be so second game you with 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.080
 NSN 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.210
 to get along with just 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.609
 soit as additional option of the percent you can then play 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.549
 if you do that you are the focus of that 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.870
 Mainly this mode in Dubai is meanwhile number 82 player just is 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.699
 and then really 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.879
 so also competition the game it is called before you were always 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.170
 in that I also grew up playing games at the lake many people still 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.579
 played alone manager 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.149
 and that has been the objective so far in the last year and now 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.200
 already visited this year after 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.879
 For a year, so to speak, people have played us against 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.680
 Much of it has to be implemented and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.750
 What he always noticed is that it's right so direct confrontations 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.450
 direct 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.220
 Dispute it means that, for example, against Böhr as if you 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.560
 against a human player plays the action can do and there 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.519
 we thought we are building trichet action cards 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.620
 for the one game 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.760
 Parents before important games and which one can earn oneself so to speak by 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.150
 Performance before so you can get points for all good cause 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.940
 because 1060 different maps which one can then purposefully for example 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.550
 inserting one notices the online mode is a bit different 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.660
 Of course, Yemen Hamm never make the main game because there is one of the most honest 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.069
 Slaves foreground if that is here 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.939
 playful elements and also the other things we did 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:16.640
 to have 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.770
 the four then actually so the competition for example gives now 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.869
 Tasks of sponsors 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.829
 to get to the longest winning streak roll off completely different stuff yes 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.799
 also much more complex loose and then stand the player competitions need 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.679
 because this goal is created and who is best for the war then 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.569
 Example a cash prize or get a game or any things and 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.089
 that's so very nice thing to look at as well as tame the toilet youth vigor 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.119
 means a little Vienna 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.460
 alone in America 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.840
 that is offered to youth player you can then according to people out 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.759
 Offer 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.259
 because the weaker clubs will prefer a little bit so small from TUI 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
 Weaving does not only start with the strongest clubs 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.859
 that means everything super number 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.549
 of course, men are stuck game too, a bit of complexity is says 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.769
 but then too 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.299
 just something for diehard fans or can even beginners with great 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.329
 Interest Red cope 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.909
 so who of course 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.809
 Of course, we know that we can build it with the new Tesla feature 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:12.860
 make it more complicated 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.569
 but I think about their every year our place 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.589
 different things this year the newbie, so to speak, it's life 

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.740
 for the first time to make it possible to cope with that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.669
 and for example, in the tactical field, the crm SCM traditionally very very 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.889
 many options make it very complicated to see through 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.100
 but now we have an assistant that means if you can do that 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.270
 the first time practically in the rhythm of the field is because if they are the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.570
 Basic attitude you have to do », explains 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.940
 one goes at least age through is first a son so games me 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.340
 not noticed since two games and so on lower abdomen explains exactly what is 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.849
 Forums for cons has 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.289
 and if you have to go through this so far then you are already fat 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.270
 and tactical settings all made 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.990
 Then you can start and honor ladies different areas 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.500
 Things are done and are now acting no 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.670
 who here very good help system that both on small and in the 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.440
 online mode is included 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.669
 because there is on every screen 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:08.500
 possible 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.069
 Now pack and pull 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.129
 March at least give apartment what really needs to be explained Matip da 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.770
 on it and then get exactly the information at this point then 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.449
 Also important are UNAMA euro-cup that are not as common causes clock 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.159
 just 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.009
 So what you see anyway but the right help is then 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.360
 also really has substance and 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.699
 A game helps even further, and it is precisely these that have to stand inside 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.630
 We want to know the stars and we asked very many people 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:34.469
 and have 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.270
 worked with the get in and also looked 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.020
 what information from niece now so what you do not know where from the problem on 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.770
 For example, simple people also in laws just have him 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.580
 observed 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.880
 and then just a lot of notes have been made to see days to go 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.719
 Problem is the problem there 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.619
 and I do not think so much further considering the very good 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.119
 Get feedback on the help as well so I think that's a big one 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.960
 step for 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.069
 for newcomers in traffic jams
