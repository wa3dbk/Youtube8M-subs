00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.750
 so really crisp music is immediately without detours goes to the knee that is the 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.330
 Free the music of the outsider 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 And because the company in the Congo has been in business for a long time, it already has one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070
 pretty big fan base now 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.709
 bring the bat 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.519
 So the free voters want 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.439
 a new CD out accident on the other hand that in a good day has always good 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.449
 Music is part of them 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 the group becomes 4 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.679
 the duty 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.109
 American push 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.370
 American happy-end a mixture of rockabilly can Sweden and from the 8 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 that is the goal of the skiers from Hetzerath 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.670
 Loos deaf 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 it will be solved for 1200 the rose 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 only in the first third of the freeware for this classic of the English group c 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 with these words the fans pull out regularly 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.859
 "Girls Girls Girls" should be the first big scene the freeware is 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.230
 to bring to the shops 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 so far it was impossible this Saturday from when the band owns the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.260
 Rights under the date for no one 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.470
 but the Freezers have heavily inspired counters 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.390
 their idiosyncratic Steel still the PDS immigrants between the worlds and for 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.540
 invigorating queen-fans 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.810
 for some will be necessary 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.149
 Luzen von Assmann years between SchÃ¶nberg and already meet himself 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.450
 Marketing must begin then but easy 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.159
 that would resist us 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.200
 yes, this music 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.320
 So he must feel like starting in Munich so learned both sons at 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 Honky Tonk to the new picture while being drunk for also professional beer the people 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 dance the music is loud 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.420
 the alleged 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 Thomas and Kassen are clearly not the youngest anymore 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.620
 Many young dynamic junior bands have already come and go 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.950
 they have been on stage together for ten years 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.499
 stupid remark due to their age just bounces off them 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910
 but you had Manuel Barroso still at Musikus hundredth 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.410
 In the end, the Police Rumba percent is just a matter of the heart one 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.879
 I want a lot of work for the Liberal 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.719
 a lot of heart blood round 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.789
 Age is definitely not a disadvantage but percent the huge advantage they have 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.099
 Do we have to have a wife as a feint and must have done for black 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.199
 you can not do that but he had to get there 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:25.379
 the ubiquitous trend 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 the underpass to play all the way is the real many 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:34.569
 APA Benz reform again so must be retro-looking on the processes 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 jump 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.920
 the Freeware Strache mainly with their own songs on 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.049
 they will completely finance their own CD without the music industry 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.299
 In the last two years they have been close to three times before 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.290
 But it did not work out to hire a record company 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.290
 no reason to cut the sails 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.039
 definitely you do not put me on my head in the sand 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.379
 Under this is the most important thing we do not have any further 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.159
 Fall to 4 percent 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.809
 of course I would have come to one or the other college five 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.479
 can sign 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.159
 Of course they are not in position either 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.159
 for the sparkle team at all 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.650
 solid jobs the own company family and children the freeware stand 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.059
 each one with both legs firmly in life 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.569
 it will have the last success, much will change the four men 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
 are ready to Reuters as well, certainly
