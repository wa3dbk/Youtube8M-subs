that<00:01:24.630> instantly<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.810> mini<00:01:25.990> reminds<00:01:26.410> me<00:01:26.649> of

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
why it's so good not only is the chassis

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.350 
why it's so good not only is the chassis
super<00:01:29.740> be<00:01:29.920> balanced<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:30.700> with<00:01:30.910> a<00:01:30.940> proper
