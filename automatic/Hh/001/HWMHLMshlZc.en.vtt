could<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.950> fake<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.610> could<00:01:44.820> very<00:01:44.850> easily<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
could be fake it could very easily be

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.969 
could be fake it could very easily be
fake<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.020> nonetheless<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.619> thought<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
fake but nonetheless I thought the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
fake but nonetheless I thought the
concept<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.579> super<00:01:48.240> awesome<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.720> super<00:01:48.960> neat

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
concept was super awesome and super neat

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.719 
concept was super awesome and super neat
and<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.770> thought<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.189> worthy<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.610> being

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and I thought it was worthy of being

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
and I thought it was worthy of being

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
about the possibility of it being real

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
if you get past that and you look at it

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.880 
if you get past that and you look at it
you'll<00:02:23.480> get<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.660> thing<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.990> center<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.860> see

it's<00:02:25.130> clearly<00:02:25.430> an<00:02:25.610> ASM<00:02:26.030> one<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.690> look<00:02:26.840> a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's clearly an ASM one you look a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.960 
it's clearly an ASM one you look a
little<00:02:27.080> bit<00:02:27.290> closer<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.610> see<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.940> says

purple tint to it a little bit of a
purple<00:02:32.780> glow<00:02:33.280> which<00:02:34.280> does<00:02:34.580> show<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:35.180> know

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
purple glow which does show you know

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.210 
purple glow which does show you know
that<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> legendary<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.860> in<00:02:37.040> fact

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
that it is legendary and it is in fact

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.640 
that it is legendary and it is in fact
an<00:02:37.490> ASM<00:02:37.910> one<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.810> try<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.230> look<00:02:39.350> at<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
an ASM one so you try and look at the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.930 
an ASM one so you try and look at the
name<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.010> can't<00:02:40.250> really<00:02:40.400> see<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.760> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
name and you can't really see it it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.750 
name and you can't really see it it
looks<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.739> legend<00:02:43.040> er<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.340> someone

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
looks like the legend er is someone

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420 
looks like the legend er is someone
there<00:02:44.209> or<00:02:44.630> maybe<00:02:44.930> maybe<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.560> says<00:02:45.709> gate<00:02:46.070> or

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
there or maybe maybe it says gate or

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.370 
there or maybe maybe it says gate or
care<00:02:47.030> or<00:02:47.330> something<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.320> a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
care or something like that it's a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.890 
care or something like that it's a
four-letter<00:02:48.620> word<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.400> there's<00:02:49.550> an<00:02:49.670> A<00:02:49.910> &amp;<00:02:50.270> R<00:02:50.510> or

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
four-letter word and there's an A &amp; R or

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.110 
four-letter word and there's an A &amp; R or
maybe<00:02:51.140> it's<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.410> T<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.370> an<00:02:52.489> e<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.090> I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
maybe it's a T and an e in it so I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.580 
maybe it's a T and an e in it so I
personally<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.660> think<00:02:53.720> it's<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.020> dare<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.320> think

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
personally I think it's a dare I think

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.290 
personally I think it's a dare I think
it<00:02:54.680> sounds<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.950> coolest<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.489> will<00:02:55.910> put<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
it sounds the coolest I will put the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.479 
it sounds the coolest I will put the

it if you want to look at it on a little

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.000 
it if you want to look at it on a little
better<00:03:05.810> resolution<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.800> looked<00:03:06.950> a

better resolution I have it looked a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.650 
better resolution I have it looked a
little<00:03:07.130> bit<00:03:07.310> more<00:03:07.430> clear<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.150> can<00:03:08.300> do<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.540> in

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
little bit more clear you can do that in

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.500 
little bit more clear you can do that in
the<00:03:08.750> description<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.820> anyway<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.209> it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510

someone I absolutely love the magnitude

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.580 
someone I absolutely love the magnitude
it<00:03:31.910> feels<00:03:32.269> exactly<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.110> normal<00:03:33.470> a

it feels exactly like the normal a
s-someone<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.700> has<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:35.000> +2<00:03:35.420> range<00:03:35.630> which

s-someone but it has that +2 range which

s-someone but it has that +2 range which
is<00:03:35.810> super<00:03:36.230> awesome<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.680> I'm<00:03:36.739> really<00:03:37.310> excited

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
is super awesome and I'm really excited

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.729 
is super awesome and I'm really excited
to<00:03:37.880> see<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.600> legendary<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.350> someone

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
to see that the legendary and someone

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.030 
to see that the legendary and someone
has<00:03:40.100> plus<00:03:40.489> three<00:03:41.329> range<00:03:42.049> which<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.320> absolutely

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
has plus three range which is absolutely

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.890 
has plus three range which is absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> plus<00:03:44.390> side<00:03:44.660> to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
ridiculous so that is the plus side to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.580 
ridiculous so that is the plus side to
it<00:03:45.019> but<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.560> -<00:03:46.040> sighs<00:03:46.250> as<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.670> has<00:03:46.790> -<00:03:47.120> -<00:03:47.720> clip

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
it but the - sighs as it has - - clip

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.229 
it but the - sighs as it has - - clip
size<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.220> have<00:03:49.400> -<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:49.970> think<00:03:50.000> that'd<00:03:50.209> be

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
size so you have - I think that'd be

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.090 
size so you have - I think that'd be
eight<00:03:50.540> bullets<00:03:51.079> total<00:03:51.470> if<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:51.680> not<00:03:51.769> mistaken

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
eight bullets total if I'm not mistaken

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.220 
eight bullets total if I'm not mistaken
which<00:03:52.910> isn't<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.239> huge<00:03:53.420> deal<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.930> know<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.110> can

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
which isn't a huge deal you know you can

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.199 
which isn't a huge deal you know you can
put<00:03:54.320> on<00:03:54.410> extended<00:03:54.860> mags<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.730> Cynthia<00:03:56.120> is

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
put on extended mags and Cynthia is

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.850 
put on extended mags and Cynthia is
someone<00:03:56.600> already<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.079> bigger<00:03:57.380> clip<00:03:57.709> than

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
someone already is a bigger clip than

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.100 
someone already is a bigger clip than
all<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.040> other<00:03:58.220> submachine<00:03:58.820> guns<00:03:59.030> um<00:03:59.150> you

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
all the other submachine guns um you

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.509 
all the other submachine guns um you
know<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.380> obviously<00:04:00.890> gonna<00:04:01.040> help<00:04:01.220> out<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> lot

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
know it's obviously gonna help out a lot

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.120 
know it's obviously gonna help out a lot
to<00:04:01.820> have<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.750> extended<00:04:03.140> mags<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.769> -

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
to have the extended mags and then the -

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.979 
to have the extended mags and then the -
-<00:04:04.310> clip<00:04:04.549> size<00:04:04.760> isn't<00:04:05.299> really<00:04:05.510> gonna<00:04:05.660> make<00:04:05.840> that

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
- clip size isn't really gonna make that

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.319 
- clip size isn't really gonna make that
big<00:04:06.049> of<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.410> deal<00:04:06.620> but<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.370> course<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.970> does<00:04:08.150> make

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
big of a deal but of course it does make

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.060 
big of a deal but of course it does make
it<00:04:08.450> necessary<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.049> put<00:04:09.140> on<00:04:09.320> extended<00:04:09.739> mags

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
it necessary to put on extended mags

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.729 
it necessary to put on extended mags
just<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.880> ak-12<00:04:11.269> rips<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.410> -

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
just like the ak-12 rips and that is -

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:13.619 
just like the ak-12 rips and that is -
to

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
to

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.539 
to
flip<00:04:14.019> sighs<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.680> know<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.829> need<00:04:15.129> extended

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
flip sighs you know you need extended

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.710 
flip sighs you know you need extended
mags<00:04:15.700> on<00:04:15.849> that<00:04:15.969> so<00:04:16.090> it'd<00:04:16.180> probably<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.600> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
mags on that so it'd probably be the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.180 
mags on that so it'd probably be the
same<00:04:16.930> thing<00:04:17.079> at<00:04:17.199> this<00:04:17.289> weapon<00:04:17.650> but

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
same thing at this weapon but

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.460 
same thing at this weapon but
nonetheless<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:19.090> think<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.930> would<00:04:20.049> still<00:04:20.289> be<00:04:20.320> an

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
nonetheless I think it would still be an

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.980 
nonetheless I think it would still be an
amazing<00:04:21.009> legendary<00:04:21.459> weapon<00:04:21.759> that<00:04:21.910> +3<00:04:22.690> range

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
amazing legendary weapon that +3 range

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.230 
amazing legendary weapon that +3 range
literally<00:04:23.620> turns<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.070> gun<00:04:24.310> into<00:04:24.550> an<00:04:24.789> assault

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
literally turns this gun into an assault

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.600 
literally turns this gun into an assault
rifle<00:04:25.590> literally<00:04:26.590> an<00:04:26.680> assault<00:04:27.039> rifle<00:04:27.100> but

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
rifle literally an assault rifle but

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.990 
rifle literally an assault rifle but
with<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.389> same<00:04:28.690> massive<00:04:29.470> massive<00:04:30.400> advantage

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
with the same massive massive advantage

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.240 
with the same massive massive advantage
this<00:04:31.180> gun<00:04:31.419> gives<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:31.840> at<00:04:31.960> close<00:04:32.259> range<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:32.740> is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
this gun gives you at close range so is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.589 
this gun gives you at close range so is
this<00:04:33.520> actually<00:04:33.910> legendary<00:04:34.330> weapon

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
this actually legendary weapon

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.540 
this actually legendary weapon
personally<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.740> could<00:04:35.919> be<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.220> stab

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
personally I think it could be the stab

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.520 
personally I think it could be the stab
seem<00:04:36.849> extremely<00:04:37.389> realistic<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.199> doesn't<00:04:38.410> seem

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
seem extremely realistic it doesn't seem

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.589 
seem extremely realistic it doesn't seem
like<00:04:38.650> anything<00:04:38.860> crazy<00:04:39.190> overpowered<00:04:39.849> it<00:04:40.300> does

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
like anything crazy overpowered it does

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.360 
like anything crazy overpowered it does
seem<00:04:40.780> extremely<00:04:41.289> good<00:04:41.560> but<00:04:41.590> like<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:42.070> said<00:04:42.190> in

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
seem extremely good but like I said in

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.760 
seem extremely good but like I said in
super<00:04:42.699> powered<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.320> know<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.560> shitty

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
super powered but you know the shitty

me<00:04:47.860> off<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:48.009> little<00:04:48.220> bit<00:04:48.340> in<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.820> personally<00:04:49.419> I

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
me off a little bit in I personally I

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.330 
me off a little bit in I personally I
don't<00:04:49.599> think<00:04:49.750> it's<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.199> exact<00:04:50.650> one

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
don't think it's the exact one

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.460 
don't think it's the exact one
it<00:04:51.789> was<00:04:51.910> probably<00:04:52.090> faked<00:04:52.539> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.020> definitely

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
it was probably faked but I definitely

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.810 
it was probably faked but I definitely
think<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.949> could<00:04:54.130> be<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> possible<00:04:54.669> gun

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
think this could be a possible gun

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.279 
think this could be a possible gun
