00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
but it actually turns out I haven't but

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
but it actually turns out I haven't but
whatever<00:00:38.520> anyway<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.420> stuff<00:00:39.629> right

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
here I have scientifically studied that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
here I have scientifically studied that
it<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.480> ends<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.020> turning<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.469> poop

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

green

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
green

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
green
I<00:00:44.489> assume<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I assume that it's just like the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.840 
I assume that it's just like the
coloring<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> fucking

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
coloring in it it's not like a fucking

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.610 
coloring in it it's not like a fucking
poison<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.510> anything<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.469> doesn't

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
poison or anything like that it doesn't

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
poison or anything like that it doesn't
hurt<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:49.950> stomach<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:50.520> anything<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.180> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
hurt my stomach or anything it's just I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
hurt my stomach or anything it's just I
guess<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> coloring<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.460> if

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
guess it's just the coloring in it so if

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
guess it's just the coloring in it so if
you're<00:00:53.670> ever<00:00:53.760> feeling<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.210> need<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> dye<00:00:55.170> your
