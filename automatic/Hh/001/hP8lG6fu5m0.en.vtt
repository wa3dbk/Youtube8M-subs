00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello me they sell the channel the video of 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.880
 It's going to be a very frank conversation today. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 what it's like to be thin for a person 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.460
 Lean I want to make it clear before 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.220
 Anything that this is my point of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 view is that is something particular is 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.800
 that I'm taking as truth 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.810
 so let's start before any 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.019
 I want to say that I 've always been. 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 lean from small since I was born I 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.949
 think 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 and in fact I had to go on a diet 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.710
 I never needed to worry about my 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 Weight 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.320
 except for it is due to my health 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 Because you're really thin. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.340
 it is not synonymous with health 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 you may be malnourished I have one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 problem is an even health problem 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.850
 and not knowing well is what I was saying 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 being thin is something I think 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 genetics 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.210
 my mother was thin my father is thin 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.940
 because my mom saves a little 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.640
 fuller than she used to be. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.630
 My father has since remained 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.979
 practically in the same weight and my brothers 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 added together so I think it's a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 a genetic thing I think I do not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.850
 I see and gaining a lot of weight having 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 problems with weight actually another 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 thing I want to say is also that in 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 Nowhere am I disrespecting you. 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.610
 of these caring people. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.640
 who care for people suffering with a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.740
 problem with anorexia and bulimia 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.020
 on the contrary of the sea ​​were I think 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 these diseases are serious diseases that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 deserve all the accompaniment and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.920
 attention that such disease size of the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 problem requires something else that I 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 I mean, it's also what I mean. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.640
 No, I want to minimize this. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.670
 fable is this 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.860
 alex enchantment involving being thin 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.130
 because being thin is not just glamor 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.810
 on the contrary just like you have 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.310
 problems when you're down when 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.530
 You are more chubby 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.330
 when you have vision problem be 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.880
 too thin not this wonderful thing 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.850
 that everyone believes to be thin too 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.270
 has its positive points clear 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.370
 many negative points also with faith I 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 I'll speak in English, it 's a lot of people. 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.209
 Believe that when you're thin everything 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.470
 Fits you, you have no problem to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.510
 choose clothes 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.000
 This is a myth, people are thin people too. 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 suffer when you choose a suit 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.239
 because adriane well and I in my case 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.850
 I am 48 kilos and has one 73 you I am 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.530
 very skinny and very tall so when 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.489
 I 'm going to buy a clothes or she stays 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.739
 big big or she gets short fishing 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.580
 as we usually say 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.100
 so what are you looking for? 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.410
 demand and demand because 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.380
 When are you going to purchase a part? 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.790
 poorest part gets more cheap 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.500
 copom with cloth is the company noticed a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.640
 good to understand what the material not so 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.940
 resistant 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.920
 Do you want to pay cheap 30 to 40 reais 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.230
 and if you know you do not think 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.959
 even this kind of clothes and you have to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.680
 take with a seamstress oprah something 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.709
 like is problematic because even the CVC 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.200
 and thirty reais to 80 and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.110
 This happens a lot and with various clothes 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.510
 several pieces so yes there is a point 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 negative in a week related to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.060
 clothes because sometimes you go 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.910
 try on a skirt and hit it wide 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.860
 or if worse people hit perfect but 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.959
 like it is too high it is very 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.090
 short and it's a little bit vulgar because 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.220
 My case is, I do not like it, I think clothes 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.010
 very short gets a little vulgar loses 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.750
 that sensuality is because certain is 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.090
 kind of clothes cause because I 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.130
 I believe that one thing is for you to show 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.130
 another thing is you show too much 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.930
 another thing that thin people suffer 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.379
 with many people 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.150
 They think it's not food when 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.250
 mature man thinks he can eat everything 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.049
 You can drink from everything you will not have 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.870
 problem with save will not be a problem 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.239
 of weight understood 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.209
 and it's actually a myth you can not 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.400
 eat everything you can not be good 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.210
 already in all that the market offers 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.300
 because because there's a lot of juice there's a lot 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.880
 ua has many preservatives and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.860
 mainly has a lot of fat and this 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.259
 It's no good for you to remember any 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.479
 Someone else and we forget it. 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.940
 when you 're thin because you only think about beauty 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.520
 just think of aesthetics forget the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.860
 health is fundamental since it has 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.259
 At this point I'll talk a little bit 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.050
 also the myth that thin people and 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.449
 healthy people there are many people 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 who have health problems and do not 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.020
 I'm just talking about anorexia, I 'm 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:04.259
 talking about health problems like 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:06.630
 High cholesterol is the problem 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.770
 stomach because because of the bad 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.380
 food 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.880
 she thinks she can eat everything and due to 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.610
 to this achism 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.030
 she ends up being abused and harmed if 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.070
 it does not happen she does not see the loss 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.870
 now she'll definitely see will see in the 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.500
 future this is a problem that people 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.199
 Lean believes that it will never happen and 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.419
 It happens, yes, it's a thin person too. 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.909
 left over from this kind of thing has to have 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.520
 a balanced eating is eating 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.449
 fruits vegetables leaves drink pretty 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.659
 liquid to avoid sugar and fat 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.159
 yes, lean people need to focus on 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.500
 because the power supply 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:50.130
 is not just for you to keep your body 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.759
 it's not just aesthetics and well-being and health 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.770
 and I think with another point is the 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.870
 sports practice lean people hate 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.340
 do sports I think when I eat 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.440
 she is thin she believes she does not 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.900
 she needs it then 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.420
 Let's have some water and think 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.010
 It's a good size and we talk to 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.530
 truth is not just how I was saying 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.290
 previously aesthetic practice 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.050
 Physical activity is health and wellness and 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.820
 You need to simplify school, I do not 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.190
 I'm practically not sad, I'm talking 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.290
 Something I do not practice I know 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.930
 is very important but she currently 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.750
 I do not practice for lack of time for taste 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.430
 I also want to say yes to a gym 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:35.590
 or doing some kind of gymnastics because 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.830
 I believe that being good with yourself 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.810
 Is okay with your body so these were 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.730
 some things that were very close 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.340
 I tried to break that and maybe you 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.880
 never stopped to think but what 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.130
 in fact just like the chubby people 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.210
 Lean also suffers and I wanted to leave 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.190
 that's clear 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.410
 so for now it's just people I hope 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.240
 You liked it if you want some 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.570
 special subject leaving a comment 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.990
 People are turning robots into 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.520
 you 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.320
 until next week kiss is not there 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.330
 forget how liked the channel was 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.919
 Finding two videos writes gives a 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.390
 look blog too 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.390
 I went with the character
