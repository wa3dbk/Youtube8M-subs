shaped funny or what the deal is but

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
shaped funny or what the deal is but
another<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.310> unfortunately<00:01:47.729> they're<00:01:48.299> they're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
another so unfortunately they're they're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.630 
another so unfortunately they're they're
comfortable<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.320> long<00:01:49.350> layer<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
comfortable for long layer but when you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
comfortable for long layer but when you
first<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.090> them<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> little

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
first put them in this I get a little

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
first put them in this I get a little
bit<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> sharp<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:54.060> poke<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.840> ear

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
bit of a sharp like poke in my ear

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
bit of a sharp like poke in my ear
because<00:01:55.200> they're<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:55.860> padded<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
because they're not very padded it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
because they're not very padded it's
just<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.570> could<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.049> comfortable

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
just it's it could be more comfortable

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
just it's it could be more comfortable
so<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:58.920> thinking<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.189> custom<00:01:59.670> custom

that does sound pretty good but it was a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
that does sound pretty good but it was a
busy<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.840> my<00:03:57.989> head<00:03:58.170> in<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.319> subway

something<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.510> think<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.930> kind<00:04:04.170> of

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
something that I think is kind of

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.780 
something that I think is kind of
impressive<00:04:04.620> when<00:04:05.010> you're<00:04:05.130> like<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.549> didn't

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.229 
even think about the base putting them
in<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.370> then<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.670> was<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.910> first<00:04:09.120> thing

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
in and then that was the first thing

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.240 
in and then that was the first thing
that<00:04:09.389> kind<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.959> tipped<00:04:10.590> me<00:04:10.799> off<00:04:10.829> I<00:04:11.069> was<00:04:11.160> like
