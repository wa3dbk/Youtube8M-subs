them back to the boat you can do the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.050 
them back to the boat you can do the
same<00:04:04.530> thing<00:04:04.770> on<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> sand<00:04:05.340> breaks<00:04:05.490> or<00:04:05.850> if<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
same thing on the sand breaks or if the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.000 
same thing on the sand breaks or if the
winds<00:04:06.240> blowing<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.530> drift<00:04:07.740> socks

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
winds blowing just get the drift socks

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.820 
winds blowing just get the drift socks
out<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.520> just<00:04:09.000> jig<00:04:09.270> fish<00:04:09.540> lift<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.380> up<00:04:10.470> let<00:04:10.800> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
out and just jig fish lift it up let it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.070 
out and just jig fish lift it up let it
fall<00:04:11.190> lift<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.000> let<00:04:12.210> it<00:04:12.240> fall<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.870> know<00:04:12.960> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
fall lift it up let it fall you know the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.900 
fall lift it up let it fall you know the
surface<00:04:13.530> temps<00:04:13.770> are<00:04:13.890> still<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> 40s<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
surface temps are still in the 40s and

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.640 
surface temps are still in the 40s and
so<00:04:15.330> a<00:04:15.360> lot<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.660> these<00:04:15.840> fish<00:04:16.080> are<00:04:16.170> picking<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> up

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
so a lot of these fish are picking it up

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.890 
so a lot of these fish are picking it up
off<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.010> bottom<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:18.060> they<00:04:18.180> remain<00:04:18.510> shallow

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
off the bottom but they remain shallow

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.199 
off the bottom but they remain shallow
for<00:04:19.320> most<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.770> day<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.910> know<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.150> just
