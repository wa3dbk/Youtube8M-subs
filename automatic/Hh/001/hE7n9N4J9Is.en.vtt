00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.680
 I have prepared the sewing machine. Ready to start. 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.840
 I don't know exactly how much I need. I'm sure it's too much. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.920
 I now have to check the upper part. It is numbered. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.720
 I think I'll just start with 1. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.840
 According to 1, I have to go down. So from top to bottom. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.680
 Beyond the yellow. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.280
 When you do this for the first time ... 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.880
 â€¦ You don't necessarily have to read the manual first, but it is handy. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.920
 Start quietly and follow the instructions on the sewing machine. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.800
 It is actually quite simple. Attaching the wire and the following steps. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760
 Beautiful. Just behind it. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 I'm going to do something about those curtains. I don't like that edge at all ... 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.520
 ... and I will straighten it out nicely. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.800
 Fold the edge twice. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.880
 I secure it with pins. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.240
 All the way through, at the top and bottom. There he goes. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.080
 That went pretty well. Let's see if this is what. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.240
 You have to start about an inch from the side. 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.800
 I have to lower the lever, that blue lever. 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.680
 Top. I am ready. To work. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 It is a good idea to start manually. 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.120
 There he goes. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.160
 That looks good. I have to go back. 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.640
 Press it down so that it returns. There he goes. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.160
 And back to the beginning. 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.760
 Awesome. Okay, lift it up. I think I can start. 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 I hit a pin and now the needle is bent and broken. So I have to replace it. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.760
 Hopefully there is a spare needle in the white container at the bottom. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.400
 Look at that. There is everything in it. Here I have a package with extra needles. 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.240
 How great. One, two, three extra needles. 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040
 You loosen this screw. 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.440
 I'll just turn it off. I could accidentally press the button. 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.640
 If so. He is loose and I can pull him out. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.480
 And we can again. Check if he goes up and down. Awesome. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.680
 I'm back at the pin again. So he has to get out. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.360
 I now know that proper preparation is important. 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.160
 Also don't forget to remove the pins to save the needle. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 Work slowly and carefully. It's not that hard, but don't work too rushed. 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.600
 Slowly and carefully. 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.080
 That goes well. 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.760
 I think two people are impressed: my mother and my wife. 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.160
 That looks perfect. I'm very happy with it. 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.720
 That was much easier than I thought. 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.800
 And it is also exactly in the right place. Top. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.400
 I also like the color. The blue thread fits very well with the flowers. 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.840
 So now I can sew curtains. Afterwards I try on trousers. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.720
 I have two pants with just a little too long legs. 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.760
 I think I can now shorten those pipes a few centimeters. 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.280
 That would be really nice. And I have more curtains. 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.600
 I will also get to work on that. 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.280
 It is really much easier than I thought.
