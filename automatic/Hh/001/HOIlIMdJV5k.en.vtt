there<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.400> an<00:02:23.550> increased<00:02:24.060> level<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.660> solar

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
there is an increased level of solar

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
there is an increased level of solar

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.610 
activity the sun's magnetic field
increases<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.540> causes<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.080> cosmic

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
particles from cyclotron experiments
where<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.150> would<00:02:54.330> smash<00:02:54.810> atoms<00:02:55.290> together

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
where they would smash atoms together

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
where they would smash atoms together
the<00:02:56.310> particles<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.120> were<00:02:57.270> produced<00:02:57.660> would

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the particles that were produced would

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.550 
the particles that were produced would
fly<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> high<00:02:59.940> humidity<00:03:00.210> chamber<00:03:00.960> they

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
fly through a high humidity chamber they

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.920 
fly through a high humidity chamber they
would<00:03:01.980> cause<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> pressure<00:03:03.000> reduction<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
would cause a pressure reduction and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.620 
would cause a pressure reduction and
leave<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.770> little<00:03:05.100> track<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.760> bubbles<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.510> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
leave a little track of bubbles in the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570 
leave a little track of bubbles in the
chamber<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.200> could<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:07.560> visualized

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
chamber that could be visualized

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.780 
chamber that could be visualized
so<00:03:09.090> what<00:03:09.750> spends<00:03:10.080> mark<00:03:10.440> determined<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
so what spends mark determined is that

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.340 
so what spends mark determined is that
when<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.180> are<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> lot<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.660> cosmic<00:03:13.110> rays

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
when there are a lot of cosmic rays

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.620 
when there are a lot of cosmic rays
penetrating<00:03:14.130> Earth's<00:03:14.310> atmosphere<00:03:14.970> they

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
penetrating Earth's atmosphere they

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.870 
penetrating Earth's atmosphere they
leave<00:03:15.900> bubble<00:03:16.320> tracks<00:03:16.590> which<00:03:16.980> creates<00:03:17.430> clouds

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
leave bubble tracks which creates clouds

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.130 
leave bubble tracks which creates clouds
so<00:03:18.870> high<00:03:19.590> solar<00:03:20.040> activity<00:03:20.840> deflect<00:03:21.840> these

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so high solar activity deflect these

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.190 
so high solar activity deflect these
particles<00:03:22.920> around<00:03:23.460> earth<00:03:23.940> around<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.900> solar

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
particles around earth around the solar

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.950 
particles around earth around the solar
system<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.830> general<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.540> increased

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
system in general so with increased

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.660 
system in general so with increased
solar<00:03:28.140> activity<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.800> have<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> lower<00:03:29.490> number

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
solar activity you have a lower number

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.930 
solar activity you have a lower number
of<00:03:30.300> clouds<00:03:30.690> because<00:03:31.620> fewer<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.520> charged

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
of clouds because fewer of these charged

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.640

cosmic<00:03:33.510> rays<00:03:33.750> are<00:03:34.050> entering<00:03:34.440> our<00:03:34.590> atmosphere

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
cosmic rays are entering our atmosphere

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.180 
cosmic rays are entering our atmosphere
from<00:03:35.340> space<00:03:35.780> by<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> same<00:03:37.290> token<00:03:37.530> when<00:03:37.890> solar

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.670 
activity is low the particles are not
deflected<00:03:42.360> around<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> solar<00:03:43.080> system<00:03:43.560> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
deflected around the solar system and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.100

they do enter our atmosphere and they do

they do enter our atmosphere and they do

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
cause an increase in clouds so the Sun

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.160 
cause an increase in clouds so the Sun
could<00:03:49.800> actually<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.520> thought<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.270> cloud

then<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.550> double<00:05:03.270> layer<00:05:03.390> detonation<00:05:04.170> could

then the double layer detonation could

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.730 
then the double layer detonation could
