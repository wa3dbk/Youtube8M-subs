so why does hypertrophy develop it's a

longer<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:28.079> wonder<00:02:28.739> why<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> mice<00:02:29.370> didn't<00:02:29.849> do

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
longer I wonder why the mice didn't do

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.610 
longer I wonder why the mice didn't do
that<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.569> first<00:02:30.840> place
